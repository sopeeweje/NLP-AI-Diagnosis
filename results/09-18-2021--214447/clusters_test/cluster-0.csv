"ARAGORN: Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation Of Ranked Networks We propose an Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation of Ranked Networks (ARAGORN), which will query Knowledge Providers (KPs) and synthesize answers relevant to user-specified questions, building upon algorithms and components developed as part of the ROBOKOP [1,2] application during the feasibility phase of Translator. The ARAGORN services represent the next generation of ROBOKOP component services, iterating and innovating in response to challenges exposed in the Translator feasibility phase. Based on that work, we have identified overarching issues that must be addressed to truly unleash the power of Translator. 1. ARAs must be able to operate in a federated knowledge environment effectively and efficiently. First-generation Translator tools assembled full data sets from which to extract answers, which were subsequently ranked. Second-generation tools must be able to efficiently operate on massive, distributed data, demanding a new approach. ARAGORN will act asynchronously, interleaving KP queries with partial scoring of answers, prioritizing search directions on-the-fly, and delivering early results that are updated over time in response to newly explored paths 2. ARAs must bridge the precision mismatch between data representations and algorithms that require specificity, and users who pose questions and prefer answers at a more abstract level. Biomedical scientists do not pose questions as database queries. Furthermore, even expert users of current biomedical databases such as ROBOKOP KG or RTX require exploration and experimentation to craft queries to express their intent. ARAGORN will employ multiple strategies to remove this barrier to asking questions effectively, from basic maintenance of a question library, to node generalization, query rewriting, and machine learning techniques such as capsule graph networks. ARAGORN will further use elements of specific answers to create gestalt explanations, clustering, and combining answers with similar content, revealing the commonalities and contradictions in answers. 3. ARAs must be able to generalize answer ranking to address a broader range of question formulations and data types, and to account for counterevidence. In the Translator implementation phase, we anticipate having access to many varied KPs and ARAs that provide diverse quantitative metadata regarding the confidence in assertions or strength of associations. There will be a pressing need to synthesize such data into scores for arbitrarily-shaped answer graphs, in order to filter and prioritize answers for further analysis or user digestion. ARAGORN will address this need by providing a novel scoring algorithm capable of (a) scoring arbitrary directed multi-hypergraphs, (b) accounting for heterogeneous quantitative metadata; and (c) leveraging relationship polarity to incorporate counterevidence. ARAGORN will provide access to this functionality, and connect to KPs using community-defined APIs and data models. The ARAGORN team has contributed to these community efforts during the Translator feasibility phase, and if funded will continue to work with the Standards and Reference Implementations (SRI) group, NCATS staff, and other awardees to continue to define and refine methods and models for data sharing and collaboration. The ARAGORN services will be created with collaboration in mind, such that they can be plugged into larger pipelining and architectural efforts. Most of the risks to the ARAGORN strategy are shared by the entire program; as standardization evolves, the ARAGORN team and other members of the Translator consortium will be required to spend effort updating components. ARAGORN will require access to ontology and similarity tools that we anticipate will be provided by KPs or shared infrastructure; if these do not materialize, the ARAGORN team will create the tools that it needs to accomplish its goals. Additionally, we are assuming the existence of fully translator-compliant KPs from which to draw data; if the program collectively decides that compliance is enforced in ARAs instead, we will draw on our work in ROBOKOP to implement the necessary normalization components in ARAGORN. n/a",ARAGORN: Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation Of Ranked Networks,10332268,OT2TR003441,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Digestion', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Formulation', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Phase', 'Provider', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'arbitrary spin', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'capsule', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'database query', 'distributed data', 'innovation', 'member', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'tool']",NCATS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,OT2,2021,1052712
"Biomedical Data Translator Development of Autonomous Relay Agent: ARAX This project would continue collaborative work within the Translator consortium by a multi-site team (“Team X-ray”) at Oregon State University (PI Stephen Ramsey) and at two partner institutions, Pennsylvania State University (PI Koslicki) and the Institute for Systems Biology (PI Eric Deutsch; Co-I Jared Roach). Team X-ray was highly productive in Translator's feasibility assessment phase and the team brings critical expertise to Translator (see Resources). Component type: We propose to create, validate, and integrate an autonomous relay agent (ARA) called ARAX . ARAX will be a middleware component in the new Translator architecture that will extend significantly beyond the capabilities of the prototype reasoning tool (RTX) that we created in the feasibility assessment phase. Depending on the input request, ARAX's main output will be ranked subgraphs with clearly explained ranking basis. ARAX will leverage code and algorithms from RTX and will have an explicit application focus area, as described below. Main problems that ARAX is trying to address: Connections within a biomedical knowledge graph have highly variable degrees of (i) confidence (due to ambiguous predicates and/or due to highly variable degrees of reliability of knowledge types) and (ii) potential relevance to the user's query. Such edge-significance variability leads to both incorrect and difficult-to-interpret results which together pose a significant problem for creating broadly useful tools for computer-based biomedical reasoning. We propose to address this problem by explicitly accounting for these two types of edge variability in the reasoning algorithms–spanning a broad range of biomedical query types–that ARAX will provide to Translator. In addition to these broad capabilities, as described in the Project Plan, we will incorporate advanced algorithms in ARAX for responding to queries relating to disease therapy, including (1) drug repositioning for known disease, leveraging knowledge about the disease’s pathogenesis [1] ; and (2) therapeutic recommendations for rare diseases based on symptoms and the putative causal genetic variant. Plan for implementation of the project: In our Project Plan we describe a five-year timeline for creating, validating, and integrating ARAX within Translator, beginning with a three-month sprint leading to a prototype of ARAX by mid-March 2020. Key components of the plan include: (1) leveraging the BioThings Explorer software framework to enable ARAX to dynamically map between compounds, proteins, pathways, variants, phenotypes, and diseases based on knowledge source application programming interfaces in the Translator registry; (2) leveraging COHD and related Translator resources to obtain biomedical semantic distance information; (3) leveraging an application programming interface endpoint for the RTX biomedical knowledge graph, KG2; and (4) implementing probabilistic reasoning algorithms leveraging provenance information and dynamically determined edge relevance scores to improve reasoning. We will systematically use machine-learning to align ranking scores with measures of output quality. Collaboration strengths of our team include (i) developing technical standards for communications between Translator software agents (leveraging PI Deutsch’s extensive past experience); (ii) developing knowledge graph standards (leveraging PI Ramsey’s and PI Koslicki’s expertise); and (iii) deriving use-case vignettes that speak to the transformative potential of Translator (leveraging Co-I Roach’s and PI Ramsey’s expertise). In the development phase, our team would continue to collaborate with other teams and with NIH stakeholders in an adaptive, high-bandwidth, and team-boundary-agnostic fashion, as detailed in the Project Plan. Key challenges to building the proposed system are (1) the need to be able to ""chain"" together analytical steps between tools and (2) the need for cooperative development of standards that enable Translator components to interact; we address them in detail in the Project Plan. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Development of Autonomous Relay Agent: ARAX,10333468,OT2TR003428,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Oregon', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Software Framework', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'TimeLine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'knowledge graph', 'middleware', 'prototype', 'tool']",NCATS,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,OT2,2021,897051
"Education Pathways for Biomedical Data Science (R25) Project Summary / Abstract This project brings together Drexel University and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) to create an adaptive Biomedical Data Science education program to empower researchers to learn and use emerging data science methods. We propose an in-line program to prepare researchers for data-driven work directly in their current field, while also identifying avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration. We will develop novel curricula pathways, leverage existing educational resources, create bridge materials, and provide practicum “lab” activities matching domain-specific projects to participants for hands-on experience. Educational Pathways in Biomedical Data Science will collaborate with the CHOP Office of Academic Training and Outreach Programs to engage a diverse learner audience in novel pedagogical research. Learners will be recruited from active participants in many existing CHOP training initiatives, including a novel data science education program, graduate student training, postdoc mentorship, physician fellowship research, and clinical research staff training. After enrollment, education program managers will cluster participants into collaborative communities of practice where they will receive mentorship and contribute to development of pathways. We acknowledge that we are still learning the most effective interventions for biomedical data science education, both within our specific communities and broadly within medical education (e.g. Federer et al., 2015; Rowhani-Faarid, Allen, and Barnett, 2017). We will develop new evidence of gaps in knowledge, skills, and attitudes among learners. We will develop and implement biomedical data science literacy instruments based on emerging scholarship. We will also gather learner feedback via mixed methods to adapt and evolve our modular resources, ensure robust learner outcomes, and align deliverables with the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science. Data Science instruction for researchers outside of traditional computer and information sciences is a concrete step toward data-driven scientific literacy for all. We will ensure that participants emerge from this program with computational and algorithmic literacy solidified through hands-on experience. For non-computing researchers, we also will provide the foundational data fluencies necessary for individuals to contribute meaningfully to machine learning research, which will enable data-driven systems, insight-to-decision transformation, decision- making, and data-driven decision management. Finally, for all participants, we will strive to help individuals from a broad spectrum of backgrounds and identities identify new directions in which to develop their careers. Project Narrative “Educational Pathways in Biomedical Data Science” will create evidence-based pathways to guide and augment researcher skill in data-intensive science. Our learning pathways and supporting modules will equip researchers to perform nimble research with massive datasets that span institutional and disciplinary boundaries. We will model cross-disciplinary collaboration by building upon an existing partnership between the College of Computing and Informatics of Drexel University and the Research Institute of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, grounding the project in both computing and biomedical research practice.",Education Pathways for Biomedical Data Science (R25),10199482,R25GM141501,"['Academic Training', 'Attitude', 'Biomedical Research', 'Certification', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community of Practice', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Degree program', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Sciences', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Education', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Peer Review', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Plant Roots', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scholarship', 'Science', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'acronyms', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'cohort', 'college', 'computer science', 'education pathway', 'education resources', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'formative assessment', 'graduate student', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'literacy', 'novel', 'online course', 'outreach program', 'pedagogy', 'programs', 'science education', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'statistics', 'student training', 'success', 'user centered design']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R25,2021,85673
"DOCKET: accelerating knowledge extraction from biomedical data sets Component type: This Knowledge Provider project will continue and significantly extend work done by the Translator Consortium Blue Team, focusing on deriving knowledge from real-world data through complex analytic workflows, integrated to the Translator Knowledge Graph, and served via tools like Big GIM and the Translator Standard API. The problem: We aim to solve the “first mile” problem of translational research: how to integrate the multitude of dynamic small-to-large data sets that have been produced by the research and clinical communities, but that are in different locations, processed in different ways, and in a variety of formats that may not be mutually interoperable. Integrating these data sets requires significant manual work downloading, reformatting, parsing, indexing and analyzing each data set in turn. The technical and ethical challenges of accessing diverse collections of big data, efficiently selecting information relevant to different users’ interests, and extracting the underlying knowledge are problems that remain unsolved. Here, we propose to leverage lessons distilled from our previous and ongoing big data analysis projects to develop a highly automated tool for removing these bottlenecks, enabling researchers to analyze and integrate many valuable data sets with ease and efficiency, and making the data FAIR [1]. Plan: (AIM 1) We will analyze and extract knowledge from rich real-world biomedical data sets (listed in the Resources page) in the domains of wellness, cancer, and large-scale clinical records. (AIM 2) We will formalize methods from Aim 1 to develop DOCKET, a novel tool for onboarding and integrating data from multiple domains. (AIM 3) We will work with other teams to adapt DOCKET to additional knowledge domains. ■ The DOCKET tool will offer 3 modules: (1) DOCKET Overview: Analysis of, and knowledge extraction from, an individual data set. (2) DOCKET Compare: Comparing versions of the same data set to compute confidence values, and comparing different data sets to find commonalities. (3) DOCKET Integrate: Deriving knowledge through integrating different data sets. ■ Researchers will be able to parameterize these functions, resolve inconsistencies, and derive knowledge through the command line, Jupyter notebooks, or other interfaces as specified by Translator Standards. ■ The outcome will be a collection of nodes and edges, richly annotated with context, provenance and confidence levels, ready for incorporation into the Translator Knowledge Graph (TKG). ■ All analyses and derived knowledge will be stored in standardized formats, enabling querying through the Reasoner Std API and ingestion into downstream AI assisted machine learning. ■ Example questions this will allow us to address include: (Wellness) Which clinical analytes, metabolites, proteins, microbiome taxa, etc. are significantly correlated, and which changing analytes predict transition to which disease? [2,3] (Cancer) Which gene mutations in any of X pathways are associated with sensitivity or resistance to any of Y drugs, in cell lines from Z tumor types? (All data sets) Which data set entities are similar to this one? Are there significant clusters? What distinguishes between the clusters? What significant correlations of attributes can be observed? How can this set of entities be expanded by adding similar ones? How do these N versions of this data set differ, and how stable is each knowledge edge as the data set changes over time? Collaboration strengths: Our team has extensive experience with biomedical and domain-agnostic data analytics, integrating multiple relevant data types: omics, clinical measurements and electronic health records (EHRs). We have participated in large collaborative consortia and have subject matter experts willing to advise on proper data interpretation. Our application synergizes with those of other Translator teams (see Letters of Collaboration). Challenges: Data can come in a bewildering diversity of formats. Our solution will be modular, will address the most common formats first, and will leverage established technologies like DataFrames and importers (like pandas.io) where possible. Mapping nodes and edge types onto standard ontologies is crucial for knowledge integration; we will collaborate with the Standards component to maximize success. n/a",DOCKET: accelerating knowledge extraction from biomedical data sets,10330627,OT2TR003443,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'FAIR principles', 'Gene Mutation', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'experience', 'indexing', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge graph', 'knowledge integration', 'large datasets', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCATS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,OT2,2021,332969
"High Performance Text Mining for Translator We propose to build a knowledge provider that will seek out, integrate and provide AI-ready, BioLink-compatible models via high-performance text-mining of the biomedical literature. Problems with Translator’s current mining of the biomedical literature that we intend to solve include: (1) weaknesses in framework extensibility and benchmarking that make integrating and validating new text-mining approaches difficult; (2) problematic licensing of software, terminologies and other resources that do not adequately support FAIR (and TLC) best practices; (3) processing only PubMed titles and abstracts, not full text publications; (4) Translator’s use of older NLP technology with relatively poor performance; (5) lack of a mechanism for community feedback regarding errors and other problems; (6) lack of continuous updates to add knowledge from new publications; (7) output knowledge representation that is simplistic and vague, failing to reflect the richness of what is expressed in scientific documents. Plan for implementation: Our team has a long history of productive NLP research, successful open source software projects, effective benchmarking and broad community engagement. We will build on the results of NLM-funded work in information extraction, our gold-standard Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text (CRAFT) corpus, a recent BioNLP Open Shared Task (BioNLP-OST) that we organized, and recent advances in state-of-the-art NLP. For Segment 1, we will: (1) Demonstrate BioStacks, an extensible, cloud-based text-mining framework that produces knowledge graphs grounded in the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBOs). This BioStacks demo will include a state-of-the-art OBO concept recognizer for multiple ontologies, a state-of-the-art semantic relationship prediction tool, and a state-of-the-art structural analysis tool. All generated assertions will have provenance metadata linking the assertion to a particular text span in a document specified by PMCID. (2) Demonstrate CRAFTST, a cloud-based text-mining evaluation system that evaluates the performance of text-mining systems against the CRAFT gold standard. (3) Demonstrate an adaptive machine learning process illustrating how to efficiently create tools to extract BioLink association types. For Segment 2, we propose to extend the text-mining and evaluation frameworks to align with BioLink and the Translator community, improve text-mining quality and expand the collection of source documents mined. Specifically, we propose to target 10 long term milestones: (1) Align CRAFT to BioLink. (2) Develop new tools for extracting associations from text. (3) Develop and manage a community engagement process on text-mining for Translator. (4) Extend benchmarking. (5) Improve recall. (6) Improve precision. (7) Improve computational efficiency. (8) Expand BioStacks to include all available full text biomedical journal articles. (9) Expand document collections to include Patents & Regulatory filings. (10) Develop a scientist-based movement to improve document access for text-mining from non-open publishers. The types of questions the resulting knowledge graph can be used to address are extremely broad, as it is generated by mining a large part of the biomedical literature. Questions that can be answered include those about specific assertions (e.g. is this drug an agonist-activator of this protein?), general relations (are these two proteins often mentioned together?), and documents (which publications mention this gene, mutation and drug?). Integration: We are long-time contributors to the open-science community and have longstanding collaborations with existing awardees; we were participants in the NIH Data Commons Pilot. We propose to align the output of text-mining tools to the BioLink model via OBO terms. We propose to implement our frameworks in NIH Cloud Computing environments. We propose to adopt the CD2H Contributor Attribution Model to foreground community contributions. We plan to coordinate with the NLM’s nascent benchmarking activities and the SmartAPI effort to build Translator standard interfaces. Challenges and gaps: High-performance mining of rich, contextualized knowledge from the literature remains a difficult task, and is unlikely to be solved in the next five years. Many important publications remain inaccessible to text-mining due to restrictive licensing. n/a",High Performance Text Mining for Translator,10334356,OT2TR003422,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Agonist', 'Benchmarking', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data Commons', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gold', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Licensing', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'cloud based', 'improved', 'information organization', 'journal article', 'knowledge graph', 'knowledge of results', 'open data', 'open source', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,OT2,2021,471239
"Tracking the dynamics of how schemas scaffold recall Project Summary Every new experience in our life takes place within the context of familiar environments and situations. However, most research on memory has focused on the artificial memorization of word lists, symbols or pictures; these studies do not meaningfully address how structured prior knowledge about the world (e.g., in the form of a familiar spatial map, or knowledge of how restaurant meals unfold over time) can scaffold new learning. In the proposed studies, I aim to precisely characterize how and where prior knowledge and new information are represented, how they get linked at encoding, and how they interact at recall to allow memories to be retrieved. In the first proposed study of my F99 phase, I test the hypothesis that hippocampal engagement at event boundaries during learning binds new information (i.e. objects) to the scaffold of existing knowledge (i.e. knowledge of a familiar location), and that hippocampal activation during recall mediates the successful retrieval of the bound object from the location in which it was stored. I also test the hypothesis that distinctive representations of spatial locations in the brain will reduce interference between objects stored in those locations. There is a potential downside to using prior knowledge as a scaffold: When there is too much information attached to one part of the scaffold, old and new memories will interfere with each other. How, then, could someone prioritize the retrieval of new memories over older (now-irrelevant) memories that were linked to the scaffold? Recent research on intentional forgetting suggests a solution to this limitation. Specifically, in my second proposed study, I test the hypothesis (supported by neurophysiological evidence, prior neuroimaging results, and computational models) that previously encoded memories can be weakened by moderately activating their neural representation, thereby “cleaning” the scaffold and reducing interference. In the K00 phase, I will extend my research to identify pathologies in how clinical populations use prior knowledge to interpret and remember their experiences, using tools from computational psychiatry; I also plan to design new technological tools to address these issues. Overall, the proposed project makes use of naturalistic and ecologically valid stimuli (in the form of continuous stimuli and immersive virtual reality) paired with advanced machine learning tools applied to brain imaging data, to study the fundamental nature of how new and old information are linked to allow learning. In the long-term, the findings from this project regarding how prior knowledge can be optimally leveraged to support new learning will lead to the development of tools to help memory-impaired individuals make better use of prior knowledge to support new learning, as well as remedies for groups where deficiencies in prior knowledge prevent them from learning properly. Project Narrative In my dissertation, I will use newly-developed machine learning techniques to study how the brain uses prior knowledge (about the spatial structure of an environment, or how certain types of events unfold in time) to scaffold new learning. By precisely characterizing how this scaffolding process works, my research will help to identify ways in which prior knowledge can be more optimally leveraged to support learning. This will lead to the development of tools to help memory-impaired individuals make better use of intact prior knowledge to support new learning, as well as remedies for groups where deficiencies in prior knowledge prevent them from learning properly.",Tracking the dynamics of how schemas scaffold recall,10156352,F99NS120644,"['Address', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Restaurants', 'Retrieval', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'field study', 'forgetting', 'memory encoding', 'memory retrieval', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'phase 1 testing', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'scaffold', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment', 'virtual world']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F99,2021,47036
"New Jersey Alliance for Clinical Translational Science: NJ ACTS Contact PD/PI: Panettieri, Reynold Alexander Project Summary/Abstract Overview Coordinated by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS), the New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS) comprises a consortium with Rutgers and Princeton Universities (PU), NJ Institute for Technology (NJIT), medical, nursing, dental and public health schools, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, industry, policymakers and health information exchanges. All Alliance universities and affiliates have provided substantial resources and contributed to the planning, development and leadership of the consortium. With access to ~7 million people, NJ ACTS serves as a ‘natural laboratory’ for translational and clinical research. With a state population of ~9 million, New Jersey ranks 11th in the US, 1st in population density and higher than average in racial and ethnic diversity. Surprisingly, NJ has no CTSA Hub to coordinate translational and clinical research. Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined.

Our CTSA Hub focuses on two overarching themes: the heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis and response to treatment, and the value of linking large clinical databases with interventional clinical investigations to identify cause-and-effect and predict therapeutic responses. NJ ACTS will provide: innovative approaches to link information from large databases and electronic health records to inform clinical trial design, execution and analysis; and novel platforms for biomarker discovery using fluorescence in situ hybridization and machine learning to identify unique neural signatures of chronic illness. NJ ACTS will access a large health system with significant member diversity; a rich legacy of community engagement and community-based research platforms; and proven approaches to enhance workforce development in clinical research. With a substantial investment in streamlining research administration and IRB practices at Rutgers and with the inception of NJ ACTS, there exists an unparalleled opportunity for logarithmic growth in clinical research in New Jersey. To build our capacity for participant and clinical interactions as a CTSA Hub, the newly established Trial Accelerator and Recruitment Office will coordinate feasibility assessment, implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of clinical studies. Additionally, our organization of five clinical research units into a cohesive network provides extraordinary expertise in strategic locations to enhance participant recruitment from diverse communities with a particular focus on: children; the elderly; those with serious mental illness or substance abuse issues; low-income individuals served by Medicaid; those with HIV/AIDS; and people of all ages who are minorities, underserved, and victims of health and environmental disparities. With a history of collaboration, partners and affiliates share unique skills, expertise, training and mentoring capabilities that will be greatly amplified within the infrastructure of a CTSA Hub. Princeton and NJIT, without medical schools or hospital affiliates, seeks collaboration with Rutgers to provide clinical research platforms; Rutgers seeks the PU and NJIT expertise in novel informatics platforms, expertise in natural language and ontology, machine learning and cognitive neurosciences. Together NJ ACTS will provide an alliance that will catalyze clinical research and training across New Jersey to improve population health and contribute to the CTSA Consortium. In this revised application, the overall themes remain unchanged but Cores leadership and direction has been markedly refined.

"Carolina Population Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Carolina Population Center requests infrastructure support that will advance population dynamics research at CPC by increasing research impact, innovation, and productivity, supporting the development of junior scientists, and reducing the administrative burden on scientists. Infrastructure support will advance science in three primary research areas: Sexuality, Reproduction, Fertility, and Families; Population, Health, and the Environment; and Inequality, Mobility, Disparities, and Well-Being. Much of the research at CPC draws on large publicly available longitudinal data sets that our faculty have designed and collected, including the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, the China Health and Nutrition Survey, newer surveys associated with the Transfer Project, and the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, all of which will continue to be important in work related to our primary research areas over the next five years. These projects embody several themes that have guided research at CPC since the Center's inception. These themes, which will continue to shape our work, are the importance of life course processes and longitudinal data, multi-level processes and measurement of context, interventions and natural experiments as means of learning about causal processes, and the relevance of sociodemographic variables such as age, gender, race- ethnicity, and socioeconomic status for disparities in health and well-being. By embedding these themes, our projects provide data that enable us to address barriers that otherwise impede progress in the population sciences generally, and in our primary research areas in particular. We request support for three cores which in combination will provide an institutional infrastructure that will push populations dynamics research forward by empowering CPC faculty to tackle challenging questions using state of the art measurement techniques and methods. The Administrative Core plans activities that maintain a stimulating intellectual community, streamlines administrative processes so that scientists can focus on research, coordinates activities of the Cores so that services are offered efficiently, and communicates information about research and data more broadly. The Development Core supports early stage investigators and other faculty with exciting new ideas through multiple mechanisms: workshops, access to technical expertise in measurement, and seed grants. The Research Services Core enables scientists to address complex and important population research issues by providing access to state-of-the-art research tools and professional support for programming, survey development, and analysis. NARRATIVE This project will provide infrastructure support for a cutting edge program of research on population dynamics at the Carolina Population Center. Research at the Center will analyze state-of-the art data to address fundamental questions regarding fertility, adolescent health, and links between the environment and health. Special attention will be paid to factors creating health disparities.",Carolina Population Center,10136647,P2CHD050924,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'China', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Creativeness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Extramural Activities', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Fertility', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Surveys', 'Home environment', 'Inequality', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Learning', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural experiment', 'Nutrition Surveys', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Policy Making', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Population Research', 'Population Sciences', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recovery', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Services', 'Sexuality', 'Shapes', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Talents', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Training Programs', 'Tsunami', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adolescent health', 'career', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'data access', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'faculty support', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel strategies', 'population health', 'privacy protection', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'sociodemographic variables', 'success', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,P2C,2021,766127
"The Metadata Powerwash - Integrated tools to make biomedical data FAIR Project Summary  The metadata that describe scientific data are fundamental resources to enable (1) the discovery and reuse of the data and (2) the reproducibility of the experiments that generated the data in the first place. Metadata are essential for scientists to understand the associated data and to reuse them, as well as for information technology to index the data, to make the data available, and to provide filters for scientists to search for the corresponding datasets. Currently, the scientific metadata hosted in public repositories suffer from multiple quality issues that limit scientists’ ability to find and reuse the experimental datasets to which they refer. It can take many weeks of a scientist’s time to identify a collection of datasets that fulfill specific criteria when the data are so poorly described—and the majority of the process is necessarily manual.  We propose to develop an end-to-end solution to standardize biomedical metadata with the help of ontologies—data structures that define the terms in an application domain and the relationships among them. There are hundreds of ontologies that provide standard terms for use in biomedicine, and they are essential resources to make biomedical metadata interoperable and reusable. Our approach also will build on the technology created by the Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR), which offers a library of building blocks and common data elements for defining computer-based metadata templates based on community standards.  Our plan involves three specific aims. First, we will develop a method and tool to standardize the multiple, ad hoc metadata field names that may appear in metadata to represent the same type of information by replacing those field names with the field names used in standard metadata templates or, if no appropriate template match is available, with terms from a relevant ontology. Second, we will develop methods and tools to standardize different types of metadata field values, for example, categorical values such as drugs or diseases, and numerical values such as age, or sample collection date. Third, we will evaluate the speed, precision, and recall of our metadata transformation pipeline—built out of the methods and tools to standardize field names and values—on a large corpus of metadata that we will manually curate based on existing public metadata. We will also carry out experiments to test the effect of the standardized metadata when biomedical scientists perform dataset search in the context of their work. Project Narrative Data that offer precise descriptions of data—metadata—are critical scientific resources that facilitate the discovery, reuse, and reproducibility of the data to which they refer. Our goal is to create methods and tools that improve the quality of scientific metadata hosted in public repositories, and thus enhance the discoverability and re-use of public biomedical datasets. Making data more accessible through scientifically rigorous metadata will accelerate the ability to make transformative data-driven biomedical discoveries using public data archives.",The Metadata Powerwash - Integrated tools to make biomedical data FAIR,10093841,R01LM013498,"['Age', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Categories', 'Collection', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'FAIR principles', 'Funding Agency', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Information Technology', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numerical value', 'Ontology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'data archive', 'data repository', 'data reuse', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information organization', 'interoperability', 'metadata standards', 'public repository', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'search engine', 'secondary analysis', 'tool']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,334847
"University of Buffalo Clinical and Translational Science Institute Contact PD/PI: Murphy, Timothy F The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes the University at Buffalo (UB) health sciences schools, the major healthcare institutions in our region, four key research institutes and five influential community partners, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New York State and has a rich cultural history. The proportion of underrepresented minorities in Buffalo in 2018 (50%) parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 30 years. A similar proportion of our population experiences health disparities. The vision for our CTSA hub is to perform innovative research across the translational spectrum to improve the health of our community and the nation. We will develop, test and share novel approaches to engage difficult-to-engage populations and reduce health disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Guided by our vision, the CTSA has catalyzed a transformation of our environment since our CTSA was first funded in August 2015 with remarkable growth in clinical and translational research. Further, in just the past year, the UB medical school has moved into a spectacular new building and our clinical partner, Kaleida Health, the largest healthcare system in the region, opened the new Oishei Children’s Hospital, both on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and connected to the Clinical and Translational Research Center devoted entirely to clinical and translational research that opened in 2012. This rapid and continuing trajectory of growth in healthcare and research in the region has resulted in a new 21st century Academic Health Center with healthcare, medical education and clinical and translational research on one campus in the heart of Buffalo, creating a foundation to enhance the impact of our CTSA even further. While launching our CTSA, we have prioritized participation in the national consortium through hosting and testing Innovation Labs as a team science tool, working with multiple hubs on initiatives to solve translational research barriers and sharing tools that we have developed with the CTSA consortium, including novel health informatics tools. Our CTSA has five ambitious but achievable aims, including: 1) Accelerate innovative translational research with teams that engage communities, regional stakeholders and the national consortium; 2) Train an excellent, diverse workforce to advance translation of discoveries; 3) Enhance inclusion of special populations across the lifespan and difficult-to-engage populations; 4) Streamline clinical research processes focusing on quality and efficiency with emphasis on multisite studies; 5) Develop, test and share biomedical informatics tools to integrate data from multiple sources to speed translation. Guided by our vision to perform research to improve the health of our community and the nation, we will continue our momentum to expand translational research, train our diverse workforce, streamline processes, engage our community, and actively contribute to the national consortium.

"Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal seeks to develop a resource for the preservation of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This insect is a foundational model organism for biological research. Over a century of work, an enormous number of fly strains harboring different mutant alleles or transgenic constructs have been generated. However, one limitation of working with flies is that there is as yet no practical method for cryopreservation of Drosophila strains. Conventional methods of vitrifying Drosophila were developed in the early 1990s and were never widely adopted due to the difficulty in performing the protocols. This is a problem from a practical perspective since all these strains need to be individually maintained in continuous culture at substantial cost and labor, and also from a scientific perspective, since in the process of continuous culture mutations can accumulate and contamination can occur, degrading the value of these resources for future experiments. A novel approach for cryopreservation of Drosophila is proposed for this R24 resource center. Isolated embryonic nuclei, rather than intact embryos, will be cryopreserved and then nuclear transplantation via microinjection will be used to create clones derived from the cryopreserved nuclei. This approach avoids the issues associated with the impermeability of embryonic membranes that have prevented the use of conventional cryopreservation approaches that have been used with other organisms. Embryonic nuclei will be cryopreserved using a naturally inspired approach. Diverse biological systems (plants, insects, etc.) survive dehydration, drought, freezing temperatures and other stresses through the use of osmolytes. On an applied level, the proposed investigation has the potential to transform preservation of Drosophila lines by 1) preserving subcellular components (specifically nuclei) as opposed to embryos; and 2) automating much of the workflow. In the long- term, the goal of this resource center is to develop a robust and scalable protocol for cryopreservation of Drosophila, thus reducing the cost and improving the quality of long-term strain maintenance. PROJECT NARRATIVE The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a very important model organism for biomedical research. The goal of this resource center is to develop effective methods of preserving fruit flies in order to lower the costs and improve the quality of stock maintenance. The approach leverages recent scientific advances to develop a new, highly automated approach for preserving fruit flies.",Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster,10160982,R24OD028444,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Cryopreservation', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Droughts', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microinjections', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear', 'Organism', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'cold temperature', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'individual response', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nuclear transfer', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'tool']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R24,2021,575125
"AUGS/DUKE UrogynCREST program PROJECT SUMMARY Health Services Research (HSR) and predictive analytics are rapidly growing fields and will have enormous implications for women’s health research in pelvic floor disorders (PFDs). The AUGS/DUKE Urogynecology Clinical Research Educational Scientist Training (UrogynCREST) program will prepare participants to recognize the critical role that data play in delivering high quality health care. It brings together expertise in health service and women’s health research, medical informatics and prediction modeling. This program will target Urogynecology Faculty at the Assistant Professor level who seek successful careers in health services research (HSR) and analytics. Participants will obtain skills through a combination of didactic and interactive coursework; hands-on manipulation of data through extraction, cleaning, and analysis; and project-based one on one mentoring. The UrogynCREST program will be an interactive, hands-on educational program with centralized activities organized and delivered by distance through a popular on-line learning platform called Sakai, with educational software designed to support teaching, research and collaboration. A diverse faculty with expertise in data sciences teaches courses and the advanced methodology required to perform HSR. Yearly in-person meetings at the annual American Urogynecologic Society meeting enhance networking and the development of partnerships between participants from various institutions, as well as, interactions with the mentors and other HSR in the field. The program’s strategy allows national leaders with particular skills in the field to provide their knowledge to the participants and help mentor them through development of a relevant research question and identification of an appropriate and existing database(s) to address the question. With the guidance of a dedicated statistician and analyst programmer, participants will learn and perform the necessary computer programming needed to extract, clean and analyze these data. Participants whose projects involve the development of prediction models in the form of scores, nomograms or other tools will learn how to build and validate such tools in the existing project. Each participant’s project will culminate in the completion of a submitted manuscript to a peer- reviewed journal or study proposal and publicly available tools when relevant. Overall, the program will shape future scientific leaders in Urogynecology by encouraging the development of clinical-scientists and provide the skills and resources for invigorating data discovery and tools for investigations in HSR specifically addressing (PFDs).

"National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Project summary/abstract NACC (as U01 AG016976, at University of Washington) has been active since 1999. The existing NACC infrastructure is described in the Facilities and Resources Section of this application. The broad goals of the past funding cycles are consistent with those of the current U24 RFA — that is, to serve as: a.) the central hub for organizing and enabling communication within and outside of the ADRC program, including annual meetings and steering committees; b.) a national data resource, collecting data from the Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) as well as affiliated data and sample repositories; and c.) a facilitator of current and future AD/ADRD research. NACC has considerable experience and success in reaching these goals, and is positioned for continued success in a rapidly advancing field. New data and methods are appearing in areas such as biomarkers, neuropathology, and tests for early detection. Through the strategic adoption of technological advances, we will build on these accomplishments at an accelerated pace. Building on our already significant capabilities, we will: promote and broaden communication within and outside of the ADRC program; expand informatics capabilities of NACC consistent with FAIR principles; conduct and support methodologic and applied research, leveraging deep expertise in biostatistics and data science; and support early-career research scientists by providing peer-reviewed competitive funding for several “junior investigators” each year. We aim to continue to improve our approach in each arena by combining time-tested approaches with the new tools and innovations we are developing to meet the changing scientific, technological, and communication needs of the NIA ADRC program and the field. Narrative NACC (as U01 AG016976, at University of Washington — now seeking renewal as a U24) has been active since 1999, and has established a standardized, longitudinal clinical database of over 42,000 individuals (with neuropathology data on over 6,100), as well as cross-sectional, retrospective data on roughly 66,000 individuals seen at ADRCs between 1984 and 2005. NACC has made these data freely available to researchers worldwide, resulting in hundreds of publications. We will modernize and intensify our informatics approach, making data access and use more efficient; will grow communication and coordination capabilities with the ADRCs and collaborating NIA projects; will develop and apply big-data research tools for the field; and will provide competitive, peer-reviewed research support for several new investigators each year. Together with the field’s leaders, NACC will innovate, develop, and drive solutions to meet the changing needs of the field as well as the NIA ADRC program.",National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center,10204491,U24AG072122,"['Achievement', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'Peer Review', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Peer Review', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'career', 'clinical database', 'clinical examination', 'cohort', 'community center', 'data access', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'disease heterogeneity', 'e-science', 'experience', 'high standard', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'programs', 'repository', 'social media', 'success', 'tool', 'translational health science', 'trend', 'web site']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U24,2021,6979612
"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome The main goal of the Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program is to aggregate, update and articulate protein-centric data, information and knowledge for the entire human proteome with emphasis on understudied proteins from the 3 families that are the focus of the IDG (“IDG List”). The long-term objective of the KMC is to encourage and support biomedical research aimed at understudied proteins by providing an extensive resource of data, information, knowledge, methods and reagents for the entire human proteome, and to support the growing online community focused on understudied proteins. With focus on the IDG List and human proteins, the KMC will enable support for expanded coverage for non-human proteins of therapeutic interest and other associated human health data, in order to catalyze novel biomedical discoveries. To support the overall IDG objective, and to maintain, update and improve these integrated resources, the KMC draws upon expertise from multiple knowledge domains, specifically biology, chemistry and medicine, as well as computer science, graphic design and web programming. Specifically, for the Phase 2 of the IDG KMC we propose 4 Aims:1. Create an automated workflow that captures relevant public data for the entire proteome and manual annotations for the IDG list. The KMC knowledge management system will be built around knowledge graphs, focused on five major branches of the target knowledge tree, tkt: Genotype, Phenotype, Expression, Structure & Function, and Interactions & Pathways, respectively. Aim 2: Design, develop and implement a protein knowledgebase with Data Analytics support. Our protein-centric biomedical knowledge base, TCKB (Target Central Knowledgebase) will be comprised of the data, knowledge and information container, together with its codebase and software pipelines. TCKB will be the repository for experimental, processed and computed data and reagents originating from the IDG DRGCs (Data and Resource Generation Centers). We will provide informatics and modeling support for DRGC activities. Aim 3: We will expand, improve and maintain Pharos. Particularly “knowledge packages,” support automated data summaries for Protein Dossiers, and actively seek feedback from our community. Aim 4. Outreach to scientific community. We will support a series of activities that will leverage TCKB, Pharos and other IDG resources to increase adoption of IDG work, while observing FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles for our knowledgebase, portal and pipelines. The KMC will engage in community outreach by leading tutorials and feedback sessions and dissemination of the Pharos system.

"Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training 2.0 (AR3T 2.0) OVERALL: ABSTRACT  The scope of regenerative medicine encompasses the repair, regeneration, and replacement of defective, injured, and diseased tissues and organs. The success of regenerative therapies is dependent, at least in part, on a favorable microenvironment in which the regenerative processes occur. Technological innovations and a deepened mechanistic understanding of how these microenvironmental signals influence tissue regeneration has drawn attention to the critical importance of the clinical field with foundations in the application of physical, thermal, and electrical stimuli to promote functional restoration—rehabilitation. We propose that the fields of regenerative medicine and rehabilitative science are inextricably intertwined, an intersection of disciplines that we and others have termed Regenerative Rehabilitation. To realize the full potential of Regenerative Rehabilitation, there is a need for formalized mechanisms that promote the interaction of basic scientists with rehabilitation specialists. During the initial funding cycle, the Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training (AR3T) built a national network of investigators and programs that has helped to expand scientific knowledge, expertise and methodologies across the domains of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation. This proposal seeks funding for AR3T 2.0, in which we will build on successes achieved and lessons learned over the initial period of support with the goal of being even more responsive to the needs of the greater community. Six specific aims define a framework upon which we will achieve our goals. AR3T will provide education and drive the science underlying Regenerative Rehabilitation by: 1) Providing didactic programs that expose rehabilitation researchers to cutting-edge investigations and state-of-the-art technologies in the field of regenerative medicine (Didactic Aim); 2) Cultivating collaborative opportunities between renowned investigators in the fields of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation (Collaborations Aim); 3) Coordinating a pilot funding program to support novel lines of Regenerative Rehabilitation research (Pilot Funding Aim); 4) Developing and validating technologies to advance the measurement and use of the regenerative rehabilitation programs (Technology Aim); 5) Promoting our center’s expertise to a broad community of trainees, investigators, and clinicians (Promotion Aim); 6) Carefully monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our program will ensure that we are successful in achieving our goals (Quality Control Aim). Administrative note: In the preparation of this proposal, we made every effort to present a comprehensive and detailed plan for achieving our goals while minimizing redundancy. Therefore, in multiple places, we refer the reader to specific components of the application, rather than repeating text. We appreciate the time and effort the reviewers devote to the evaluation of the proposals.  Sincerely, Fabrisia, Tom and Mike PROJECT NARRATIVE  Regenerative Rehabilitation is the integration of principles and approaches across the fields of rehabilitation science and regenerative medicine. The integration of these two fields will increase the efficiency of interventions designed to optimize physical functioning to the benefit of a wide range of individuals with disabilities. The Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training (AR3T) 2.0 will build on the momentum gained over the first cycle of funding with the goal of continuing to illuminate and seize opportunities to expand scientific knowledge, expertise and methodologies in the domain of Regenerative Rehabilitation.",Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training 2.0 (AR3T 2.0),10210417,P2CHD086843,"['Accountability', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Country', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'In Vitro', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Organ', 'Performance', 'Physical Function', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Reader', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'career', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'falls', 'functional restoration', 'gait examination', 'healing', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interest', 'investigator training', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'regenerative', 'regenerative rehabilitation', 'regenerative therapy', 'rehabilitation research', 'rehabilitation science', 'repaired', 'response', 'sabbatical', 'social media', 'success', 'symposium', 'technological innovation', 'therapy design', 'tissue regeneration', 'webinar']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,P2C,2021,983634

"Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt Founded in 1965 as one of the original Intellectual and Developmental Disorders Research Centers (IDDRC), the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center (VKC) IDDRC serves as the central nexus across Vanderbilt for interdisciplinary research, communication, and training in intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The VKC IDDRC serves as a trans-institutional institute that brings together over 200 faculty from 38 departments in 10 schools at Vanderbilt. The VKC’s mission to facilitate discoveries that inform best practices to improve the lives of people with IDD and their families. This mission is met by leveraging our outstanding institutional resources and support, partnering with disability communities, and capitalizing on synergistic interactions across the VKC’s federally-designated centers: the VKC IDDRC, a University Center of Excellence in Developmental Disabilities and a Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities program. The IDDRC as the centerpiece of the VKC is the foundational organizing structure that creates a “Center culture” wherein research and discovery permeates the VKC’s broader training and service activities, thus enhancing the translational research goals of the IDDRC. Demonstrable IDDRC success includes 976 investigator- authored publications and robust NIH funding to Vanderbilt to support IDD-related research ($52.6M in FY20). Harnessing and leveraging this trans-institutional strength to focus on unique challenges in IDD, the overarching goal of the next phase of the IDDRC is to develop precision care for IDD by providing infrastructure and scientific leadership to enable rapid translation of basic discoveries into high- impact IDD interventions and treatments. Three global Aims guide the IDDRC’s work. Aim 1 provides core services to enable and disseminate impactful research on individualizing treatments based upon the causes, mechanisms, and contributing co-morbid sequelae of IDD; Aim 2 focuses on incorporating innovative methods and approaches to enhance multidisciplinary IDD research; and Aim 3 proposes to conduct a signature research project to improve the precision use of antipsychotic medication in people with autism. Across these Aims and five Cores supported by the IDDRC (Administrative, Clinical Translational, Translational Neuroscience, Behavioral Phenotyping, and Data Sciences), three themes permeate our work: (1) recruitment of highly-skilled researchers not currently conducting IDD research (non-traditional researchers); (2) inclusion of IDD participants into research studies that currently do not include IDD (non-traditional subjects); and (3) incorporation of novel scientific approaches and methods (non-traditional approaches). Our IDDRC is ideally posed to enable rapid discovery of precision care approaches by supporting 50 investigators leading 70 research projects (15 from NICHD) and, as highlighted by the Signature Research Project, to promote and implement generative, novel, and impactful research directions, thus meeting the NICHD’s vision of applying newly evolved technologies and approaches to rapidly accelerate the prevention and/or amelioration of IDDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a group, intellectual and developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, have dramatic effects on affected people’s and their caregiver’s lives. Unfortunately, there remains a lack of understanding about what causes these disabilities and, critically, how to treat them with targeted therapies. The Vanderbilt Kennedy Center’s Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center serves as the hub for Vanderbilt’s research efforts focusing on improving the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities by understanding the causes of these disorders and developing and testing therapies tailored to each individual’s precise needs.",Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt,10229591,P50HD103537,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Affect', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Down Syndrome', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Research', 'Prevention', 'Problem behavior', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinical translation', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'drug-induced weight gain', 'experience', 'image processing', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'translational neuroscience', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P50,2021,1364066
"Deep learning for population genetics Project Summary The revolution in genome sequencing technologies over the past 15 years has created an explosion of population genomic data but has left in its wake a gap in our ability to make sense of data at this scale. In particular, whereas population genetics as a field has been traditionally data-limited, the massive volume of current sequencing means that previously unanswerable questions may now be within reach. To capitalize on this flood of information we need new methods and modes of analysis.  In the past 5 years the world of machine learning has been revolutionized by the rise of deep neural networks. These so-called deep learning methods offer incredible flexibility as well as astounding improvements in performance for a wide array of machine learning tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. This proposal aims to harness the great potential of deep learning for population genetic inference.  In recent years our group has made great strides in using supervised machine learning for population genomic analysis (reviewed in Schrider and Kern 2018). However, this work has focused primarily on using more traditional machine learning methods such as random forests. As we argue in this proposal, DNA sequence data are particularly well suited for modern deep learning techniques, and we demonstrate that the application of these methods can rapidly lead to state-of-the-art performance in very difficult population genetic tasks such as estimating rates of recombination. The power of these methods for handling genetic data stems in part from their ability to automatically learn to extract as much useful information as possible from an alignment of DNA sequences in order to solve the task at hand, rather than relying on one or more predefined summary statistics which are generally problem-specific and may omit information present in the raw data.  In this proposal we lay out a systematic approach for both empowering the field with these tools and understanding their shortcomings. In particular, we propose to design deep neural networks for solving population genetic problems, and incorporate successful networks into user-friendly software tools that will be shared with the community. We will also investigate a variety of methods for estimating the uncertainty of predictions produced by deep learning methods; this area is understudied in machine learning but of great importance to biological researchers who require an accurate measure of the degree of uncertainty surrounding an estimate. Finally, we will explore the impact of training data misspecification—wherein the data used to train a machine learning method differ systematically from the data to which it will be applied in practice. We will devise techniques to mitigate the impact of such misspecification in order to ensure that our tools will be robust to the complications inherent in analyzing real genomic data sets. Together, these advances have the potential to transform the methodological landscape of population genetic inference. Project Narrative Deep learning has revolutionized such disparate fields as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. In this proposal we aim to harness the great potential of deep learning for population genetic inference. We will design, implement, and apply novel deep learning methods and provide open source software for others to both use and build upon, thereby producing valuable tools for the genetics researchers at large.",Deep learning for population genetics,10147906,R01HG010774,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Floods', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Selections', 'Nature', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Explosions', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Software Tools', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'base', 'computational chemistry', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'empowered', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'random forest', 'recurrent neural network', 'research and development', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'stem', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tool development', 'user friendly software']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2021,417279
"Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Candidate: With my multidisciplinary background in Artificial Intelligence (PhD), Public Health Informatics (MS), Epidemiology and Health Statistics (MS), and Preventive Medicine (Bachelor of Medicine), my career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Biomedicine, with a particular emphasis initially in machine learning and public health. Training plan: My K99/R00 training plan emphasizes machine learning, deep learning and scientific communication skills (presentation, writing articles, and grant applications), which will complement my current strengths in artificial intelligence, statistics, medicine and public health. I have a very strong mentoring team. My mentors, Drs. Michael Becich (primary), Gregory Cooper, Heng Huang, and Michael Wagner, all of whom are experienced with research and professional career development. Research plan: The research goal of my proposed K99/R00 grant is to increase the re-use of computable biomedical knowledge, which is knowledge represented in computer-interpretable formalisms such as Bayesian networks and neural networks. I refer to such representations as models. Although models can be re-used in toto in another setting, there may be loss of performance or, even more problematically, fundamental mismatches between the data required by the model and the data available in the new setting making their re-use impossible. The field of transfer learning develops algorithms for transferring knowledge from one setting to another. Transfer learning, a sub-area of machine learning, explicitly distinguishes between a source setting, which has the model that we would like to re-use, and a target setting, which has data insufficient for deriving a model from data and therefore needs to re-use a model from a source setting. I propose to develop and evaluate several Bayesian Network Transfer Learning (BN- TL) algorithms and a Convolutional Neural Network Transfer Learning algorithm. My specific research aims are to: (1) further develop and evaluate BN-TL for sharing computable knowledge across healthcare settings; (2) develop and evaluate BN-TL for updating computable knowledge over time; and (3) develop and evaluate a deep transfer learning algorithm that combines knowledge in heterogeneous scenarios. I will do this research on models that are used to automatically detect cases of infectious disease such as influenza. Impact: The proposed research takes advantage of large datasets that I previously developed; therefore I expect to quickly have results with immediate implications for how case detection models are shared from a region that is initially experiencing an epidemic to another location that wishes to have optimal case-detection capability as early as possible. More generally, it will bring insight into machine learning enhanced biomedical knowledge sharing and updating. This training grant will prepare me to work independently and lead efforts to develop computational solutions to meet biomedical needs in future R01 projects. Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Narrative Re-using computable biomedical knowledge in the form of a mathematical model in a new setting is challenging because the new setting may not have data needed as inputs to the model. This project will develop and evaluate transfer learning algorithms, which are computer programs that adapt a model to a new setting by removing and adding local variables to it. The developed methods for re-using models are expected to benefit the public’s health by: (1) improving case detection during epidemics by enabling re-use of automatic case detectors developed in the earliest affected regions with other regions, and, more generally, (2) increasing the impact of NIH’s investment in machine learning by enabling machine-learned models to be used in more institutions and locations.",Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge,10158538,K99LM013383,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Influenza', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parainfluenza', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'computer program', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'detector', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'skills', 'statistics', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2021,93342
"Center for Machine Learning in Urology PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to establish an Exploratory Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Benign Urology at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), the central mission of which is to apply machine learning to improve the understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, risk stratification, and prediction of treatment responses of benign urological disease among children and adults. The proposed CHOP/Penn Center for Machine Learning in Urology (CMLU) addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede the development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. Structurally, urologic research occurs in silos, with little interaction among investigators that study different diseases or different populations (e.g. pediatric and adult). Scientifically, analysis of imaging and other types complex data is limited by inter-observer variability, and incomplete utilization of available information. This proposal overcomes these barriers by applying cutting-edge approaches in machine learning to analyze CT images that are routinely obtained for evaluation of individuals with kidney stone disease. Central to the CHOP/Penn CMLU is the partnership of urologists and experts in machine learning, which will bring a new approach to generating knowledge that advances research and clinical care. In addition, the CMLU will expand the urologic research community by providing a research platform and standalone machine learning executables that could be applied to other datasets. The Center’s mission will be achieved through the following Aims, with progress assessed through systematic evaluation: Aim 1. To expand the research base investigating benign urological disease. We will establish a community with the research base, particularly with the KURe, UroEpi programs, other P20 Centers, and O’Brien Centers. We will build this community by providing mini-coaching clinics to facilitate application of machine learning to individual projects, developing an educational hub for synchronous and asynchronous engagement with the research base, and making freely available all source codes and standalone executables for all machine learning tools. Aim 2. To improve prediction of ureteral stone passage using machine learning of CT images. The CMLU has developed deep learning methods that segment and automate measurement of urinary stones and adjacent renal anatomy. In the Research Project, we will compare these methods to existing segmentation methods and the current gold standard of manual measurement. We will then extract informative features from thousands of CT scans to predict the probability of spontaneous passage of ureteral stones for children and adults evaluated in the CHOP and Penn healthcare systems. Aim 3. To foster collaboration in benign urological disease research across levels of training and centers through an Educational Enrichment Program. We will amplify interactions across institutions and engage investigators locally and nationally by providing summer research internships, and interinstitutional exchange program, and an annual research symposium. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed CHOP/Penn O’Brien Center for Machine Learning in Urology addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. This application overcomes these barriers by applying cutting- edge approaches in machine learning to analyze complex imaging data for individuals with kidney stone disease.The Center’s strategic vision of using machine learning to generate knowledge that improves diagnosis, risk stratification strategies, and prediction of outcomes among children and adults will be achieved through the implementation of a Educational Enrichment Program and a Research Project.",Center for Machine Learning in Urology,10260577,P20DK127488,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internships', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urologist', 'Urology', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'complex data', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'human error', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'programs', 'risk stratification', 'routine imaging', 'senior faculty', 'skills', 'summer research', 'symposium', 'tool', 'urologic', 'web page']",NIDDK,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,P20,2021,332101
"Swift.ai: research and development of an integrated platform for machine-assisted research synthesis Project Abstract (30 lines of text)  1 Systematic review and evidence mapping, both forms of research synthesis, are formal, sequential processes  2 for identifying, assessing, and integrating the primary scientific literature. These approaches, already  3 cornerstones of evidence-based medicine, have recently gained significant popularity in several other  4 disciplines including environmental, agricultural, and public health research and are increasingly utilized for  5 informed decision making by governmental organizations. It has been estimated that more than 25,000  6 systematic reviews are conducted and published annually and selecting studies for inclusion is one of the most  7 resource intensive steps for any systematic review or evidence map. In Phase I of our research plan, we have  8 developed a web-based, collaborative systematic review web application called SWIFT-Active Screener, an  9 innovative document screening tool that allows users to identify the majority of relevant articles after screening 10 only a fraction of the total number of abstracts. Our goal for the current proposal is to conduct additional 11 research and development required to make SWIFT-Active Screener a commercial success, while also 12 building on and leveraging methods and software we have previously built to address other stages in the 13 systematic review pipeline. Therefore, one of the primary aims of our ongoing research and development is to 14 address this need by expanding the Active Screener application into an integrated platform for research 15 synthesis by uniting it with several of our other related software products. The resulting platform, which we call 16 “swift.ai,” is described in detail in “Aim 1 – Software engineering to create a unified platform for research 17 synthesis.” In “Aim 2 – Improved statistical methods for Active Screener 2.0”, we expand on the methodological 18 research completed during Phase I of this SBIR, to further develop and refine our methods. Specifically, we 19 investigate new ways to integrate state-of-the art methods in deep learning and new ways to better utilize the 20 large amounts of screening data collected from our users in order to improve our models. Finally, in “Aim 3 – 21 Living evidence maps powered by Active Screener 2.0,” we explore new approaches for using machine 22 learning to facilitate evidence mapping. Project narrative Systematic review is a formal process used widely in evidence-based medicine and environmental health research to identify, assess, and integrate the primary scientific literature with the goal of answering a specific, targeted question in pursuit of the current scientific consensus. By conducting research and development to build a unified, web-based, collaborative, systematic review software application that integrates the latest developments in deep-learning, machine learning, natural language processing and artificial intelligence, we will make an important contribution toward ongoing efforts to automate systematic review. These efforts will serve to make systematic reviews both more efficient to produce and less expensive to maintain, a result which will greatly accelerate the process by which scientific consensus is obtained in a variety of medical and health-related disciplines having great public significance.",Swift.ai: research and development of an integrated platform for machine-assisted research synthesis,10259172,R44ES029001,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Agriculture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Elements', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environmental Health', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Influentials', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Formulations', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxicology', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'active method', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'public health research', 'research and development', 'response', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'systematic review', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NIEHS,"SCIOME, LLC",R44,2021,820314
"Advanced End-to-End Relation Extraction with Deep Neural Networks ABSTRACT Relations linking various biomedical entities constitute a crucial resource that enables biomedical data science applications and knowledge discovery. Relational information spans the translational science spectrum going from biology (e.g., protein–protein interactions) to translational bioinformatics (e.g., gene–disease associations), and eventually to clinical care (e.g., drug–drug interactions). Scientists report newly discovered relations in nat- ural language through peer-reviewed literature and physicians may communicate them in clinical notes. More recently, patients are also reporting side-effects and adverse events on social media. With exponential growth in textual data, advances in biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) methods are gaining prominence for biomedical relation extraction (BRE) from text. Most current efforts in BRE follow a pipeline approach containing named entity recognition (NER), entity normalization (EN), and relation classiﬁcation (RC) as subtasks. They typically suffer from error snowballing — errors in a component of the pipeline leading to more downstream errors — resulting in lower performance of the overall BRE system. This situation has lead to evaluation of different BRE substaks conducted in isolation. In this proposal we make a strong case for strictly end-to-end evaluations where relations are to be produced from raw text. We propose novel deep neural network architectures that model BRE in an end-to-end fashion and directly identify relations and corresponding entity spans in a single pass. We also extend our architectures to n-ary and cross-sentence settings where more than two entities may need to be linked even as the relation is expressed across multiple sentences. We also propose to create two new gold standard BRE datasets, one for drug–disease treatment relations and another ﬁrst of a kind dataset for combination drug therapies. Our main hypothesis is that our end-to-end extraction models will yield supe- rior performance when compared with traditional pipelines. We test this through (1). intrinsic evaluations based on standard performance measures with several gold standard datasets and (2). extrinsic application oriented assessments of relations extracted with use-cases in information retrieval, question answering, and knowledge base completion. All software and data developed as part of this project will be made available for public use and we hope this will foster rigorous end-to-end benchmarking of BRE systems. NARRATIVE Relations connecting biomedical entities are at the heart of biomedical research given they encapsulate mech- anisms of disease etiology, progression, and treatment. As most such relations are ﬁrst disclosed in textual narratives (scientiﬁc literature or clinical notes), methods to extract and represent them in a structured format are essential to facilitate applications such as hypotheses generation, question answering, and information retrieval. The high level objective of this project is to develop and evaluate novel end-to-end supervised machine learning methods for biomedical relation extraction using latest advances in deep neural networks.",Advanced End-to-End Relation Extraction with Deep Neural Networks,10200889,R01LM013240,"['Adverse event', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Drug Interactions', 'Encapsulated', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Heart', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Sciences', 'Intramural Research', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trees', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'clinical care', 'deep neural network', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'natural language', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'protein protein interaction', 'relating to nervous system', 'side effect', 'social media', 'supervised learning', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2021,332681
"xARA: ARA through Explainable AI In response to the NIH FOA OTA-19009 “Biomedical Translator: Development” we propose to build an Autonomous Relay Agent (ARA) that can characterize and rate the quality of information returned from multiple multiscale heterogeneous knowledge providers (KPs). Biomedical researchers develop a trust relationship with a knowledge provider (KP) through frequent and continued use. Over time a familiarity develops that drives their understanding and insight on 1) how to structure and invoke more effective queries, 2) the quality of the results they may expect in response to different query parameters and feature values, and 3) how to assess the relevancy of a specific query’s results. Although this information retrieval paradigm has served the research community moderately well in the past it is not scalable and the number, scope and complexity of KPs is increasing at a dramatic pace (1,613 molecular biology databases reported as of Jan. 2019). Within this ever changing information landscape, a biomedical researcher now has two choices -- either continue using the few KPs they have learned to trust but remain limited in the actionable information they will receive, or invest the time and accept the risk of using a range of new information resources with little or no familiarity and thus uncertain effectiveness. If researchers are to benefit from the vast array of NIH and industry sponsored information assets now available and expanding new information retrieval and quality assessment technologies will be required. We propose to build an Explanatory Autonomous Relay Agent (xARA) that can characterize query results by rating the quality of information returned from multi-scale heterogeneous KPs. The xARA will utilize multiple information retrieval and explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) strategies to perform queries across multiple heterogeneous KPs and rank their results by quality and relevancy while also identifying and explaining any inconsistencies among databases for the same query response. To deliver on this promise, we will utilize case-based reasoning and language models trained with biomedical data (i.e., BioBERT and custom annotation embeddings through Reactome and UniProt) permitting a new level of query profiling and assessment. Our strategies will permit 1) information gaps to be filled by testing alternative query patterns that produce different surface syntax yet possess semantically related and actionable concepts, 2) inconsistencies to be identified for a given query feature value, and 3) the identification and elimination or merging of semantically redundant query results via similarity metrics enriched by case-based reasoning strategies employed in the explainable AI (xAI) community to identify machine learning model behavior and performance. The xARA capabilities proposed herein will be based on strategies developed in Dr. Weber’s lab for information retrieval where the desire for greater transparency when reasoning over experimental data is our primary aim. Our multi-institutional team is comprised of senior researchers and software engineers formally trained and experienced in the computer and data sciences, cheminformatics, bioinformatics, molecular biology, and biochemistry. Inherent risks in querying heterogeneous KPs include the presence of inconsistent labeling of the same biomedical concept within unique KP data structures. Manual engineering may be necessary to overcome such hurdles, but will not be a significant challenge for the initial prototype, since only two well documented KPs are being evaluated. Another noteworthy risk is that the quality of word embeddings generated from UniProt and Reactome may not be sufficient, requiring further textual analysis of biomedical text like PubMed, which is feasible within the timeframe of our project plan. n/a",xARA: ARA through Explainable AI,10330631,OT2TR003448,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Familiarity', 'Industry', 'Information Resources', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Semantics', 'Software Engineering', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'case-based', 'cheminformatics', 'computer science', 'experience', 'insight', 'prototype', 'response', 'syntax']",NCATS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,OT2,2021,736476
"Knowledge-Based Biomedical Data Science Knowledge-based biomedical data science  In the previous funding period, we designed and constructed breakthrough methods for creating a semantically coherent and logically consistent knowledge-base by automatically transforming and integrating many biomedical databases, and by directly extracting information from the literature. Building on decades of work in biomedical ontology development, and exploiting the architectures supporting the Semantic Web, we have demonstrated methods that allow effective querying spanning any combination of data sources in purely biological terms, without the queries having to reflect anything about the structure or distribution of information among any of the sources. These methods are also capable of representing apparently conflicting information in a logically consistent manner, and tracking the provenance of all assertions in the knowledge-base. Perhaps the most important feature of these methods is that they scale to potentially include nearly all knowledge of molecular biology.  We now hypothesize that using these technologies we can build knowledge-bases with broad enough coverage to overcome the “brittleness” problems that stymied previous approaches to symbolic artificial intelligence, and then create novel computational methods which leverage that knowledge to provide critical new tools for the interpretation and analysis of biomedical data. To test this hypothesis, we propose to address the following specific aims:  1. Identify representative and significant analytical needs in knowledge-based data science, and  refine and extend our knowledge-base to address those needs in three distinct domains: clinical  pharmacology, cardiovascular disease and rare genetic disease.  2. Develop novel and implement existing symbolic, statistical, network-based, machine learning  and hybrid approaches to goal-driven inference from very large knowledge-bases. Create a goal-  directed framework for selecting and combining these inference methods to address particular  analytical problems.  3. Overcome barriers to broad external adoption of developed methods by analyzing their  computational complexity, optimizing performance of knowledge-based querying and inference,  developing simplified, biology-focused query languages, lightweight packaging of knowledge  resources and systems, and addressing issues of licensing and data redistribution.

"In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions. IN-SILICO PREDICTION OF PROTEIN-PEPTIDE INTERACTIONS Automated docking methods are used extensively for gaining a mechanistic understanding of the molecular interactions underpinning cellular processes. While these tools work well for small molecules they perform poorly for peptides and cannot handle Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) which play very important roles in these processes. The goal of this project is the development of an efficient and practical peptide docking software, useful for designing therapeutic peptides and gaining insight into IDPs binding ordered proteins. The proposed software supports biomedical applications ranging from investigating chemical pathways to designing and optimizing therapeutic molecules for diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders. Under the previous award we developed and released a new method for docking fully-flexible peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids: AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP). We showed that it outperforms current state-of-the-art docking methods. For the next award, we propose to: 1) further develop ADCP to support docking IPDs with up to 70 amino acids and improve support for therapeutic peptides containing modified amino acids and complex macrocycles; 2) develop peptide-specific scoring functions to increase docking success rates and methods for predicting the free energy of binding of peptides. This will be done by exploiting the latest advances in statistical potentials for docking, as well as applying machine-learning techniques; 3) test and validate the software on our datasets, community benchmarks, and through our collaborations with outstanding biologists working on biomedical applications spanning from designing drugs for thrombosis and influenza, to modeling IDPs interacting with globular proteins; and 4) document the software and release it under an open source license on a regular basis along with datasets we compile and update on regularly. The proposed research will occur in the context of collaborations with experimental biologists working on highly relevant biomedical projects and providing experimental feedback and validation. In addition, this project will benefit from various collaborations with experts in the fields of computational biology, applied mathematics and artificial intelligence. This docking software tool will be developed by applying best practices in software engineering and be implemented as a modular, extensible, component-based software framework for peptide docking. This docking engine will be part of the widely used AutoDock software suite. The ability to model complexes formed by proteins and fully-flexible peptides or IDPs is in high demand and will greatly extend the range of peptide-based therapeutic approaches for which automated docking can be successfully applied. It will also support gaining insights into interactions of IDPs with proteins. As such, it will impact the research of many medicinal chemists and biologist and extend the use of computational tools to a wider community of scientists, thereby supporting the advancement of biomedical research. Automated docking is a workhorse for rational drug design, however, applying these methods to peptides has remained challenging, thus impeding the designing of therapeutic peptides and the study of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP) binding to their ordered partners. During the prior funding period, we made substantial progress toward peptide docking, resulting in a new docking engine: AutoDock CrankPep, which outperforms state-of-the-art docking methods for linear and cyclic peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids. We propose to further develop AutoDock CrankPep to support docking of therapeutic peptides with modified amino acids as well as IDPs with up to 70 amino acids, creating a practical docking tool for peptides that will impact the research of many computational and medicinal chemists and biologist, contribute to our understanding of biological processes, and significantly advance biomedical research.",In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions.,10259801,R01GM096888,"['Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Cyclic Peptides', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Drug Design', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Influenza', 'Insulin', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Renaissance', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Framework', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombosis', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'design', 'flexibility', 'globular protein', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in silico', 'insight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'open source', 'peptide drug', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'receptor', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'translational study', 'virtual screening']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,399375
"SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community Physics-based simulations provide a powerful framework for understanding biological form and function. They harmonize heterogeneous experimental data with real-world physical constraints, helping researchers understand biological systems as they engineer novel drugs, new diagnostics, medical devices, and surgical interventions. The rise in new sensors and simulation tools is generating an increasing amount of data, but this data is often inaccessible, preventing reuse and limiting scientific progress. In 2005, we launched SimTK, a website to develop and share biosimulation tools, models, and data, to address these issues. SimTK now supports 62,000+ researchers globally and 950+ projects. Members use it to meet their grants’ data sharing responsibilities; experiment with new ways of collaborating; and build communities around their datasets and tools. However, challenges remain: many researchers still do not share their digital assets due to the time needed to prepare, document, and maintain those assets, and since SimTK hosts a growing number of diverse digital assets, the site now also faces the challenge of making these assets discoverable and reusable. Thus, we propose a plan to extend SimTK and implement new solutions to promote scientific data sharing and reuse. First, we will maintain the reliable, user-friendly foundation upon which SimTK is built, continuing to provide the excellent support our members expect and supporting the site’s existing features for sharing and building communities. Second, we will implement methods to establish a culture of model and data sharing in the biomechanics community. We will encourage researchers to adopt new habits, making sharing part of their workflow, by enabling the software and systems they use to automatically upload models and data to SimTK via an application programming interface (API) and by recruiting leading researchers in the community to serve as beta testers and role models. Third, we will create tools to easily replicate and extend biomechanics simulations. Containers and cloud computing services allow researchers to capture and share a snapshot of their computing environment, enabling unprecedented fidelity in sharing. We will integrate these technologies into SimTK and provide custom, easy-to-use interfaces to replicate and extend simulation studies. Lastly, we will develop a metadata standard for models and data for the biomechanics community, increasing reusability and discoverability of the rich set of resources shared on SimTK. We will use the new standard on SimTK and fill in the metadata fields automatically using natural language processing and machine learning, minimizing the burden and inaccuracies of manual metadata entry. We will evaluate our success in achieving these aims by tracking the number of assets shared and the frequency they are used as a springboard to new research. These changes will accelerate biomechanics research and provide new tools to increase the reusability and impact of shared resources. By lowering barriers to data sharing in the biosimulation community, SimTK will continue to serve as a model for how to create national infrastructure for scientific subdisciplines. SimTK is a vibrant hub for the development and sharing of simulation software, data, and models of biological structures and processes. SimTK-based resources are being used to design medical devices and drugs, to generate new diagnostics, to create surgical interventions, and to provide insights into biology. The proposed enhancements to SimTK will accelerate progress in the field by lowering barriers to and standardizing data and model sharing, thus 1) increasing the quantity and also, importantly, the quality of resources that researchers share and 2) enabling others to reproduce and build on the wealth of past biomechanics research studies.",SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community,10085652,R01GM124443,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophysics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Habits', 'Infrastructure', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomechanical model', 'community building', 'complex biological systems', 'data access', 'data cleaning', 'data ecosystem', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'digital', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'member', 'metadata standards', 'new technology', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'research study', 'response', 'role model', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,489919
"A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis. The opioid epidemic in the United States has been traced to a 1980 letter reporting in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that synthetic opioids are not addictive. A belated citation analysis led the journal to append this letter with a warning this letter has been “heavily and uncritically cited” as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.” This epidemic is but one example of how unreliable and uncritically cited scientific claims can affect public health, as studies from industry report that a substantial part of biomedical reports cannot be independently verified. Yet, there is no publicly available resource or indicator to determine how reliable a scientific claim is without becoming an expert on the subject or retaining one. The total citation count, the commonly used measure, is inherently a poor proxy for research quality because confirming and refuting citations are counted as equal, while the prestige of the journal is not a guarantee that a claim published there is true. The lack of indicators for the veracity of reported claims costs the public, businesses, and governments, billions of dollars per year. We have developed a prototype that automatically classifies statements citing a scientific claim into three classes: those that provide supporting or contradicting evidence, or merely mention the claim. This unique capability enables scite users to analyze the reliability of scientific claims at an unprecedented scale and speed, helping them to make better-informed decisions. The prototype has attracted potential customers among top biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, academia, and academic publishers. We propose to conduct research that will refine scite into an MVP by optimizing prototype efficiency and accuracy until they reach feasible milestones, and will refine the product-market fit in our beachhead market, academic publishing, whose influence on the integrity and reliability of research is difficult to overestimate. We propose to develop a platform that can be used to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims. Our deep learning model, combined with a network of experts, automatically classifies citations as supporting, contradicting, or mentioning, allowing users to easily assess the veracity of scientific articles and consequently researchers. By introducing a system that can identify how a research article has been cited, not just how many times, we can assess research better than traditional analytical approaches, thus helping to improve public health by identifying and promoting reliable research and by increasing the return on public and private investment in research.",A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis.,10162578,R44DA050155,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biotechnology', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Epidemic', 'Government', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'New England', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Program Description', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual system structure', 'addiction', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning classifier', 'literature citation', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid therapy', 'product development', 'programs', 'prototype', 'synthetic opioid', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIDA,"SCITE, INC.",R44,2021,753275
"Image-guided Biocuration of Disease Pathways From Scientific Literature Realization of precision medicine ideas requires an unprecedented rapid pace of translation of biomedical discoveries into clinical practice. However, while many non-canonical disease pathways and uncommon drug actions, which are of vital importance for understanding individual patient-specific disease pathways, are accumulated in the literature, most are not organized in databases. Currently, such knowledge is curated manually or semi-automatically in a very limited scope. Meanwhile, the volume of biomedical information in PubMed (currently 28 million publications) keeps growing by more than a million articles per year, which demands more efficient and effective biocuration approaches.  To address this challenge, a novel biocuration method for automatic extraction of disease pathways from figures and text of biomedical articles will be developed.  Specific Aim 1: To develop focused benchmark sets of articles to assess the performance of the biocuration pipeline.  Specific Aim 2: To develop a method for extraction of components of disease pathways from articles’ figures based on deep-learning techniques.  Specific Aim 3: To develop a method for reconstruction of disease-specific pathways through enrichment and through graph neural network (GNN) approaches.  Specific Aim 4: To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the pipeline.  The overarching goal of this project is to develop a computer-based automatic biocuration ecosystem for rapid transformation of free-text biomedical literature into a machine-processable format for medical applications.  The overall impact of the proposed project will be to significantly improve health outcomes in individualized patient cases by efficiently bringing the latest biomedical discoveries into a precision medicine setting. It will especially benefit cancer patients for which up-to-date knowledge of newly discovered molecular mechanisms and drug actions is critical.

"Audio Generation and Optimization from Existing Resources for Patient Education Project Summary/Abstract Health literacy is vital to achieving and maintaining good health. Several national programs have emphasized this goal and its importance. Text is generally much more efficient and cost-effective for presenting healthcare information on a large scale than interactive tools and videos. Over the past decade, therefore, most medical information has been provided as text, e.g., via printed pamphlets or on websites. We are entering a new era where a new similarly effective mode of information dissemination is becoming increasingly available: audio accessed with mobile devices. Millions of households have and use smart speakers and virtual assistants and they are increasingly used by patients and consumers to gather information. Hospitals also plan to gradually integrate them among their tools. However, there exist few if any guidelines on optimal generation and use of audio. The overall goal of this project is to discover how to support the creation of optimal audio from existing text sources for consumer and patient education. To accomplish this, four aims are proposed. The first aim is to identify audio features that affect information comprehension and retention. Here, features in audio content and style (e.g., word frequency or grammatical complexity) of the underlying information will be tested for impact. In addition, two groups of features specific to the audio medium will be tested: the delivery features (e.g., speed and pauses) as well as meta-features (e.g., speaker characteristics such as gender or accent and bias in listeners). This first aim will rely on large-scale datasets, semi-automatically generated and augmented with user scores for comprehension gathered using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Statistical and machine learning approaches will be used to tease out the best features and combinations. The second aim focuses on discovering how to augment text for audio and finding the optimal combination of text and audio for information comprehension and retention. Different combinations will be tested online with MTurk participants using controlled user studies. The third aim is to update, test and provide the existing online free text editor to generate optimized audio. We will also start dissemination of the tool to potential users including API access to components. The project will conclude with a summative evaluation with representative consumers recruited at a local community health center and further dissemination of preferences, practical obstacles, and best practices for the medical community to help increase health literacy through this new, popular audio medium. If successful, this project will generate best practices for the medical community in using audio as an additional method for bringing healthcare information to the general public; it will provide an online, free tool to generate audio leveraging these best practices and will include API access so that other researchers can easily integrate tool components into their research and tools; and it will provide immediate practical lessons from working with consumers relevant for clinical practice. Project Narrative Improving health literacy is an important national goal and necessary for achieving and maintaining health. The increased adoption of smart speakers and virtual assistants by consumers and in medical settings has created novel opportunities to educate the population by delivering health information through audio or audio combined with text. Because few (if any) tools exist to improve content and generate optimal audio, we aim to discover supportive and adverse features of audio/text information provision and create a free, online software tool for optimizing health-related text with demonstrated impact on information comprehension and retention.",Audio Generation and Optimization from Existing Resources for Patient Education,10295641,R01LM011975,"['Accent', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Arizona', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Household', 'Information Dissemination', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhood Health Center', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Participant', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Update', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Work Simplification', 'Writing', 'application programming interface', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'intelligent personal assistant', 'interactive tool', 'large scale data', 'novel', 'open source', 'preference', 'programs', 'real world application', 'recruit', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2021,257905
"Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium Project Summary/Abstract The Arkansas Research Alliance proposes to hold five annual workshops on the subject of bioinformatics. The purpose is to bring six major Arkansas institutions into closer collaboration. Those institutions are: University of Arkansas-Fayetteville; Arkansas State University; University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences; University of Arkansas at Little Rock; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff; and the National Center for Toxicological Research. The workshops will focus on capabilities at each of the six in sciences related to bioinformatics including artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, food and agriculture, high speed computing, and visualization capabilities. As this work progresses, educational coordination and student encouragement will be important components. Principals from all six institutions are collaborating to accomplish the workshop goals. Project Narrative The FDA ability to protect the public health is directly related to its ability to access and utilize the latest scientific data. Increased proficiency in collecting, presenting, validating, understanding, and drawing quantitative inference from the massive volume of new scientific results is necessary for success in that effort. The complexity involved requires continued development of new tools available and being developed within the realm of information technology, and the workshops proposed here will address this need. Specific Aims  • Thoroughly understand the resources in Arkansas available for furthering the capabilities in  bioinformatics and its associated needs, e.g., access to high speed computing capability and use  of computational tools. • Develop a set of plans to harness and grow those capabilities, especially those that are relevant  to the needs of NCTR and FDA. • Stimulate interest and capability across Arkansas in bioinformatics to produce a larger cadre of  expertise as these plans are implemented. • Enlist NCTR’s help in directing the effort toward seeking local, national and international data  that can be more effectively analyzed to produce results needed by FDA and others, e.g.,  reviewing decades of genomic/treatment data on myeloma patients at the University of  Arkansas for Medical Sciences. • Develop ways in which the Arkansas capabilities can be combined into a coordinated, synergistic  force larger than the sum of its parts. • Encourage students and faculty in the development of new models and techniques to be used in  bioinformatics and related fields. • Improve inter-institutional communication, including developing standardized bioinformatics  curricula and more universal course acceptance.",Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium,10214625,R13FD006690,[' '],FDA,ARKANSAS RESEARCH ALLIANCE,R13,2021,3125
"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy 7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop practical methods to support privacy-preserving genomic and healthcare predictive modeling, and build innovations based on Blockchain technology for secure and robust machine learning training processes. The development of such privacy technology may increase public trust in research and quality improvement. The technology we propose will also contribute to the sharing of predictive models in ways that meet the needs of genomic research and healthcare.",BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy,10133117,R00HG009680,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Authorization documentation', 'Award', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distributed Databases', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Fibrinogen', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Institutional Policy', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'blockchain', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'diverse data', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'open source', 'peer', 'peer networks', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'privacy preservation', 'privacy protection', 'programs', 'public trust', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'trend', 'web portal', 'web services']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R00,2021,249000
"Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY This application is for renewal of the Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging at the University of Washington and affiliated institutions. This Center has over the past 25 years provided key resources in support of investigators who study the biology of aging. This application continues a theme that emphasizes outreach and service to the broadest community of investigators in the gerosciences. Of proximal relevance is the characterization of aging-related phenotypes of longevity and healthspan. As our Center services must be easily accessible to outside users, our Longevity and Healthspan Core (Core E) focuses on invertebrate assays, many of them novel. Two other Resources Cores focus on the high dimensional assessments that are closely related to aging phenotypes: Protein Phenotypes of Aging (Core C) and Metabolite Phenotypes of Aging (Core D). Sophisticated computational and bioinformatic tools for data analysis and optimal insight are provided by the Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics Core F. Each of these four Resource Cores is led by highly respected experts in that field, including Michael MacCoss and Judit Villen (Core C), Daniel Promislow (Core D), Matt Kaeberlein and Maitreya Dunham (Core E) and Su-In Lee (Core F). Each will push the envelope of appropriate technologies, developing new state-of-the art approaches for assessments that are the most applicable to gerontology and making them accessible to the national aging community. The Research Development Core (Core B) will continue to support pilot and junior faculty studies, with a firm focus on outreach of service to the national geroscience constituency. The Administrative and Program Enrichment Core (Core A) supports administrative management, an external advisory panel, courses, and data sharing and dissemination. Core A’s program of seminars and symposia will continue a focus on sponsorship and organization of national courses, meetings and pre-meetings, as well as workshops in the fields allied to our Resource Core Services. In coordination with other Nathan Shock Centers, we will support a new Geropathology Research initiative. UW NATHAN SHOCK CENTER OVERALL - PROJECT NARRATIVE We apply for renewal of the Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging at the University of Washington, which has for 25 years provided key resources supporting investigators who study the biology of aging. The overarching goal of this Center is to have a positive impact on the field by accelerating research discovery and providing research support for investigators nationally and internationally, particularly junior investigators in the process of building their own research programs. We will accomplish this goal through six cores that function synergistically together: four Resource Cores with particular expertise in protein (Core C) and metabolite (Core D) phenotypes of aging, invertebrate longevity and healthspan phenotypes (Core E) and artificial intelligence and bioinformatics (Core F), along with a Research Development Core (Core B) that supports external pilot projects and junior faculty studies, and an Administrative and Program Enrichment Core (Core A) that supports administrative management, an external advisory panel, sponsorship and organization of national meetings and pre-meetings, courses, workshops and seminars, and, in coordination with other Nathan Shock Centers, a Geropathology Research initiative.",Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in Basic Biology of Aging,10260476,P30AG013280,"['Aging', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology of Aging', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Faculty', 'Genes', 'Genetic study', 'Gerontology', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Office of Administrative Management', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Philosophy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'bioinformatics tool', 'career development', 'cell age', 'computerized tools', 'data dissemination', 'data sharing', 'healthspan', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'outreach', 'outreach services', 'programs', 'protein metabolite', 'research and development', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trait']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P30,2021,962037
"Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders The Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders supports a full day of presentations by leading scientists in areas that are having transformational effects in the communication sciences and disorders (CSD) discipline. The Research Symposium is held at the annual Convention of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and is open to all of the approximately 15,000 Convention attendees, which includes students, practitioners, and researchers. Following Convention, the Symposium content is widely disseminated through audio recordings of the presentations, which are synced with the slides and transcribed, and by making them freely accessible on the ASHA website. Additionally, each presenter submits an article based on their presentation to the Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research to be published in the annual Research Symposium Forum. An innovation that will be implemented in this current funding cycle is that ASHA will make these articles freely accessible upon publication on the ASHA Journals website and will deposit them in PubMed Central without embargo. The first aim of the Research Symposium grant is to advance scientific discourse and dissemination of scientific discovery and innovation on five topics that are having transformational effects across several subareas in CSD. This will be accomplished, in part, by making the Research Symposium Forum open access and by widely promoting both the recorded and the written content across ASHA’s many communication channels. Over the next 5-year funding cycle, the Symposium will address five topics that cut across the areas of hearing, speech, language, and other aspects of cognition, including (1) Health and Healthcare Equity of People With Communication Disabilities, (2) Bilingualism, (3) Artificial Intelligence in CSD, (4) Genetics in CSD, and (5) Intervention and Implementation Clinical Trials in CSD. The second aim of the Research Symposium grant is to advance the research career development of early- career scientists focused on research in CSD. Between 2021 and 2025, the Research Mentoring- Pair Travel Award and ASHA’s in-kind contribution will provide funding to attend the Symposium and mentoring support to 130 early-career scientists in CSD. The Travel Award recipients will attend the Symposium along with a mentor and engage in mentored research activities before, during, and after each Symposium. These activities are designed to help integrate the protégés into their scientific community and encourage them to pursue a research career and become productive scholars. The scientific base of the CSD discipline will be strengthened by these scientific dissemination, research education, and mentoring activities. The Research Symposium in Communication Sciences and Disorders aims to strengthen the scientific base and increase the research capacity of the discipline, which will lead to improvements in the communication health of millions people with communication or related disorders. The Symposium presentations will advance the scientific dialogue and be broadly disseminated through freely available peer-reviewed publications and transcribed recordings.

"Advanced Training at the Interface of Engineering and Oral-Craniofacial Sciences Contact PD/PI: KOO, HYUN Oral diseases and disorders in the craniofacial complex disproportionally and devastatingly afflict susceptible populations, particularly impoverished families and medically or physically compromised persons. Novel engineering approaches, properly leveraged, can yield new paradigms to reveal disease mechanism, new strategies for disease mitigation, and new approaches for affordable/personalized therapies for dental caries, periodontal diseases, and oral cancer. To achieve this vision, academic research bound dentist-scientists must be adept in engineering concepts and engineers must be educated in oral and craniofacial sciences and needs; all must be aware of the complex clinical and regulatory landscapes. To address this urgent need, we propose a multidisciplinary training program in Penn’s School of Dental Medicine (PDM) and School of Engineering & Applied Sciences (SEAS) focused on training dentist-scientists and engineers for academic careers dedicated to research in precision oral health and healthcare innovation. Postdoctoral trainees will adopt cutting-edge approaches at the forefront of engineering and computational sciences to advance the fields of oral biofilm microbiome, host immunity and tissue regeneration, drawing on approaches including artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, and materials sciences, aware of developmental hurdles and requirements to safely bring new approaches to patients. Trainees will engage in interactive and tailored academic experiences with intensive mentored research via co-mentoring (one advisor from each school), and interaction with a career mentoring committee (CMC) that includes at least one dental clinician. Co-mentors and CMC members will be drawn from the Program Faculty of 26 faculty in PDM and SEAS with significant records of mentorship of multidisciplinary and translational research. Training will include: (1) engineering fundamentals for dental trainees and oral & craniofacial biology principles for engineering trainees, tailored to match their research project and academic needs, (2) clinical research and regulatory affairs, (3) principles of scientific rigor and reproducibility, (4) scientific writing and (5) workshops on professional and career development. Trainees will engage in academic and industry interactions, journal club, give symposia presentations, and participate in AADR/IADR activities. Training will culminate in F/K award applications focused on advancing oral health at the dental-engineering interface. The applicant pool at the University of Pennsylvania is exceptionally strong and diverse, and we anticipate being able to attract outstanding candidates. Furthermore, via partnerships with ADA, AADR/IADR and minority-serving dental schools, we will diversify our candidate pool. We plan to enroll 4 trainees per year. Importantly, this effort will be an element of a newly formed inter-school center between PDM and SEAS with shared funding. The proposed program, unique to Penn, leverages a superb research and training environment within a compact campus where resources for both schools are united through Penn’s new Center for Innovation and Precision Dentistry. Project Summary/Abstract Page 6 Contact PD/PI: KOO, HYUN Advances in engineering approaches offer previously unimagined opportunities to advance the NIDCR 2030 vision of precision oral health for all. To harness this opportunity, a critical mass of cross-trained dentists and engineers engaged in oral and craniofacial research are urgently needed. We will develop this workforce.

"Breakthrough Molecular Dynamics Research via an Anton2 Supercomputer Project Summary In 2010, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) and D.E. Shaw Research (DESRES) partnered to make the Anton special-purpose molecular dynamics (MD) supercomputer available to the national biomedical research community for the first time. Anton enabled researchers to simulate biomolecular systems two orders of magnitude faster than any conventional supercomputer, allowing researchers access to critical multi- microsecond and longer timescales on which most biologically-significant molecular processes take place. In 2016, with operational support from NIH, DESRES made available a next generation Anton 2 system at PSC at no cost. This multimillion-dollar gift from DESRES, with NIH support, provided a unique opportunity for researchers to tackle even more groundbreaking biological questions by simulating systems as large as 700,000 atoms at a rate of multiple microseconds per day. The goal of this renewal project is to provide the national biomedical research community with continued access to this unique and powerful Anton 2 resource and to maximize the benefit of this resource to the community. Since 2010, PSC has supported 589 research projects conducted by 202 unique PIs on the Anton systems hosted at PSC. So far, these projects have resulted in 292 publications, many of which have had significant impact on their fields of research. These fields cover the entire spectrum of biomolecular processes that form the fundamental underpinnings of biology, including protein folding, ion channel selectivity and gating, membrane dynamics and organization, protein- ligand binding, and many others. Demand for Anton 2 is quite high, with 2-3x higher demand than can be met each year. Given this, our goals are focused not only on providing continued access but also on maximizing the value of this limited resource to the community—recognizing that the creativity of the broad, diverse Anton 2 research community is one of our most powerful resources for innovation. Anton 2 will be integrated as an XSEDE service provider, and the accessibility and impact of Anton 2 will significantly increase by engaging in their extensive broadening participation, outreach, and training programs. Through these outreach efforts, researchers at many more institutions will have the opportunity to use Anton 2, especially researchers from traditionally underrepresented groups in biomedical research. The hundreds of long-timescale MD trajectories researchers generate on Anton 2 constitute a unique and valuable dataset that can be used to gain additional biomedical knowledge and advance the application of machine learning protocols to augment molecular dynamics simulations. This important dataset will be available to researchers and educators worldwide through a web portal and co-located on the PSC's Bridges-2 system for classroom instruction and research, including reanalysis, machine learning, and data mining. Project Narrative The Anton 2 supercomputer made available at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center through this award will enable researchers to simulate biomolecular systems orders of magnitude faster than any conventional supercomputer.

"Developing novel technologies that ensure privacy and security in biomedical data science research Data science holds the promise of enabling new pathways to discovery and can improve the understanding, prevention and treatment of complex disorders such as cancer, diabetes, substance abuse, etc., which are significantly on the rise. The promise of data science can be fully realized only when collected data can be collaboratively shared and analyzed. However, the widespread increases in healthcare data breaches due to inappropriate access as well as the increasing number of novel privacy attacks restrict institutions from sharing data. Indeed, in some cases, the results of the analysis can themselves lead to significant privacy harm. The success of the data commons depends on ensuring the maximal access to data, subject to all of the patient privacy requirements including those mandated by legislation, and all of the constraints of the organization collecting the data itself. While there are existing solutions that can solve parts of the problem, there are significant challenges in truly incorporating these into comprehensive working solutions that are usable by the biomedical research community, and new challenges brought on by modern techniques such as deep learning. The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that can holistically enable data sharing while respecting privacy and security considerations and to ensure that they are implemented in existing platforms that have widespread acceptance in the research community. Towards this, the objective of this project is to develop complementary solutions for risk inference, distributed learning, and access control that can enable different modalities of data sharing. The problems studied are general in nature and will evolve depending on research successes and new impediments that arise. The proposed program of research is significant since lack of access to biomedical data can lead to fragmentation of care, resulting in higher economic and social costs, and is a significant impediment to biomedical research. The project will result in open-source, freely available software tools that will be integrated into widely used data collection, cohort identification, and distributed analytics platforms. There are several ongoing collaborations that will serve as initial pilot customers to provide use cases, identify the requirements, evaluate results, and in general validate the developed solutions. Project Narrative Statement of Relevance to Public Health Being able to ensure privacy and security while enabling data sharing and analysis is critical to pave the way forward for public health research and improve our understanding of diseases. The proposed work will address the challenges that impede the use of data across all of the different modalities of data sharing. The integration into existing platforms will ensure that the developed models, tools, and solutions directly impact the research community and improve public health interventions.",Developing novel technologies that ensure privacy and security in biomedical data science research,10077318,R35GM134927,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Commons', 'Data Science', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Security', 'Software Tools', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Work', 'biomedical data science', 'care fragmentation', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health research', 'social', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ NEWARK,R35,2021,383279
