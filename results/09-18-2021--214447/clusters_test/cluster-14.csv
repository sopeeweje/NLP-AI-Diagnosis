"Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication Project Summary/Abstract: Processing acoustic communication signals is among the most difficult yet vital abilities of the auditory system. These abilities lie at the heart of language and speech processing, and their success or failure has profound impacts on quality of life across the lifespan. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that support these basic abilities holds promise for advancing assistive listening devices, and for improving diagnoses and treatments for learning disabilities and communication disorders, such as auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, and specific language impairment. Non-invasive neuroscience techniques in humans reveal the loci of language-related processing but do not answer how individual neurons and neural circuits implement language-relevant computations. Thus, circuit-level neuro-computational mechanisms that support acoustic communication signal processing remain poorly understood. Multiple lines of research suggest that songbirds can provide an excellent model for investigating shared auditory processing abilities relevant to language. This proposal investigates neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing abilities shared between songbirds and humans. In Aim 1, we test the cellular-level predictions of a powerful modelling framework, called predictive coding, proposed as a general computational mechanism to support the learned recognition of complex temporally patterned signals at multiple timescales. We combine state-of-the-art machine learning methods with multi-electrode electrophysiology, to test explicit models for natural stimulus representation, prediction, and error coding in single cortical neurons and neural populations. One aspect of auditory perception integral to speech is the discretization of the signal into learned categorically perceived sounds (phonemes). In Aim 2, we use the predictive coding framework to investigate the learned categorical perception of natural auditory categories in populations of cortical neurons. In humans, the transition statistics between adjacent phonemes can aid or alter phoneme categorization, providing cues for language learners and listeners to disambiguate perceptually similar sounds. Aim2 also examines how categorical neural representations are affected by temporal context. In addition to which phonemes occur in a sequence, speech processing also requires knowing where those elements occur. Sensitivities to the statistical regularities of speech sequences are established long before infants learn to speak, and continue to affect both recognition and comprehension throughout adulthood. Songbirds also attend to the statistical regularities in their vocal communication signals. In Aim 3, we focus on how sequence-specific information is encoded by single neurons and neural populations in auditory cortex. The proposed approach permits progress in the near term towards establishing the basic neurobiological substrates of foundational language-relevant abilities and a general framework within which more complex, uniquely human processes, can be proposed and eventually tested. Project Narrative: Normal speech comprehension and communication are rooted in basic auditory cognitive processes. Deficits in these processes accompany severe communication disorders (e.g. auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, specific language impairment, autism), and their abnormal function can compound the negative impacts of hearing impairments. The proposed project investigates the neuronal mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing using natural communication signals, with the ultimate goal of understanding the neurobiological basis of language-relevant abilities and improving treatment of communication processing disorders.",Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication,10160864,R01DC018055,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Sturnus vulgaris', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'bird song', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'language comprehension', 'language processing', 'learned behavior', 'machine learning method', 'model development', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'pattern perception', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'specific language impairment', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'success']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,335661
"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,10194459,R13DC017375,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Aphasia', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Governing Board', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-aphasic', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speech Perception', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Travel', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career networking', 'experience', 'frontier', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'meetings', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'semantic processing', 'success', 'symposium', 'syntax', 'tenure track', 'web site']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2021,39939
"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment (PLI) emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, identification in toddlers is not currently possible because of the high rate of false positives reflecting transient language delays. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, neurodevelopmental approach to generate earlier, more accurate identification of toddler risk for persistent PLI via: (a) multi-faceted, longitudinal assessment of toddler emergent language patterns; (b) detailed consideration of the transactional language environment; and (c) accounting for emergent health risk in predictive models. Earlier, reliable identification of toddlers at highest risk for PLI will optimize early intervention to prevent developmentally- cascading effects.",The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment,10105196,R01DC016273,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'model building', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'standard measure', 'translational approach', 'visual tracking']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,653332

"Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders Abstract Language delay and impairments are common in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), as are sensory (including auditory) anomalies. Since acquisition of spoken language relies on the integrity of the auditory system, language delay and impairments may be related to sound processing abnormalities that are frequently observed in children with ASDs (despite normal peripheral hearing). However, it is not understood if and how early auditory brain anomalies may developmentally contribute to impaired language development.  This project will examine the maturation of auditory and language systems in the brain across early childhood, during the critical period for language acquisition. We will employ a longitudinal design and multimodal neuroimaging, including high-resolution anatomical, diffusion, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with added frequent and extensive behavioral and neuropsychological assessments. Our central hypothesis is that early disruptions to cortical sound processing precede and predict language impairments in ASDs and may thus be considered causal contributors – a hypothesis that has been frequently considered in the literature, but never tested at the neural level.  Our aims are to thoroughly characterize the structural integrity and functional differentiation of the cortical auditory and language systems (Aim 1) and their maturational trajectories (Aim 2) in toddlers with ASDs and age-matched typically developing peers. This will allow us to establish whether neural abnormalities in cortical processing of complex sounds in toddlers are predictive of language development and social behavior at the pre-school age (Aim 3). The rationale and translational significance of this project are that identification of alterations in brain development linked to language delay and impairment in the first years of life will allow for more targeted interventions in the auditory domain at a time when they are most effective. Project narrative The project aims to find causes of language impairment in children with autism spectrum disorders by studying the brain organization of the auditory system in toddlers at the very earliest age of provisional diagnosis. The overarching hypothesis is that atypical auditory processing contributes to language delay and impairment. Pinpointing auditory causes of language problems in children with ASDs may inform early interventions.",Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders,10132296,R01DC017736,"['Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Anisotropy', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early Intervention', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hearing', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Morphology', 'Neurites', 'Neuropsychology', 'Nursery Schools', 'Organizational Change', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Radial', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sensory', 'Sleep', 'Social Behavior', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TEP1 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'auditory processing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'critical period', 'density', 'early childhood', 'gray matter', 'indexing', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'language impairment', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'molecular modeling', 'multimodality', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'peer', 'phonology', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sound', 'theories', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,588497
"CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare Project Summary Wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has led to huge clinical databases, which enable the rapid growth of healthcare analytics market. One particular challenge for analyzing EHRs data is that much detailed patient information is embedded in clinical documents and not directly available for downstream analysis. Therefore, clinical natural language processing (NLP) technologies, which can unlock information embedded in clinical narratives, have received great attention, with an estimated global market of $2.65 billion by 2021 . In our previous work, we have developed CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing), a clinical NLP tool with demonstrated superior performance through multiple international NLP challenges and a large user community (over 1,500 downloads by users from over 700 organizations). Commercialization of CLAMP by Melax Technologies Inc. has been successful (i.e., with a dozen licensed customers now); but it also reveals its limitations as a desktop application in the Cloud era. Therefore, we propose to extend CLAMP to a new Cloud- based, Service-oriented platform (called CLAMP-CS), which will address the identified challenges by: 1) improving clinical NLP performance and reducing annotation cost by leveraging the state-of-the-art algorithms such as deep learning, active learning and transfer learning and making them accessible to less experienced users; 2) following new service-oriented architectures to make CLAMP-CS available via SaaS and PaaS, ready for Cloud-based development and deployment; and 3) improving CLAMP-CS interoperability with downstream applications following two widely used standard representations: HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and OMOP CMD (Common Data Model), to support the use cases in clinical operations and research respectively. With these advanced features, we believe CLAMP-CS will be a leading clinical NLP system in the market and it will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical/translational research. Project Narrative In this study, we plan to develop a new clinical natural language processing (NLP) tool based on the existing widely used CLAMP (Clinical Language Annotation, Modeling, and Processing) system, to support enterprise development and deployment of NLP solutions in healthcare. We believe that the new generation of Cloud- based, service-oriented NLP tool will accelerate the adoption of NLP technology for diverse healthcare applications and clinical and translational research.","CLAMP-CS: a Cloud-based, Service-oriented, high-performance Natural Language Processing Platform for Healthcare",10136739,R44TR003254,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Belief', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Administration', 'International', 'Language', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Operations Research', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Records', 'Research', 'Services', 'System', 'Technology', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Work', 'active method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'language training', 'learning algorithm', 'model building', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rapid growth', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NCATS,"MELAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2021,496453
"Extended Methods and Software Development for Health NLP Project Summary Our program vision is to unravel the information buried in health-related narratives by advancing text-processing methods in a unified way across all the genres of health texts and distributing them through an advanced NLP software platform under solid governance and sustainability. The crosscutting theme is the investigation of methods for health NLP made possible by big data, fused with health knowledge. The underlying theme of this renewal is the development of methods towards generalizable, efficient and knowledge-rich models in the context of modern machine learning techniques, particularly models implementing attention mechanisms and using large unlabeled datasets. There is growing penetration of deep learning approaches in the field of health natural language processing. Our proposal aims to address critical methodological gaps and understudied areas in the current unprecedented fast-paced environment. Therefore, our renewal lays out novel and much needed explorations of health NLP research which we will advance through our specific aims. Our datasets will continue to span the spectrum of health-related data – Electronic Medical Records clinical narrative, patient-authored on- line community posts, and health-related social media. The evaluation of the methods we will develop will be performed on the key clinical tasks of concept extraction, relation extraction, and phenotyping with comparisons to other traditional or deep learning algorithms as baselines. We will demonstrate impact of our methods and tools through several use cases, ranging from clinical point of care to public health, to translational and precision medicine. Finally, we will disseminate our work through community activities to advance the state of the art in health natural language processing. Project Narrative There is a deluge of health texts.

"Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The purpose of this proposal is to develop two strategies, natural language processing (NLP) and automated speech analysis (ASA), to enable automated identification of patients with cognitive impairment (CI), from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) in clinical settings. The number of older adults in the United States with MCI and ADRD is increasing and yet the ability of clinicians and researchers to identify them at scale has advanced little over recent decades and screening with clinical assessments is done inconsistently. Alternative strategies using available data, like analysis of diagnostic codes in the clinical record or insurance claims, have very low sensitivity. NLP and ASA used with machine learning are technologies that could greatly increase ability to detect MCI and ADRD in clinical contexts. NLP automatically converts text in the electronic health record (EHR) into structured concepts suitable for analysis. Thus, clinicians’ documentation of signs and symptoms or orders of tests and services that reflect or address cognitive limitations can be efficiently captured, possibly long before the clinician uses an ADRD-related diagnostic code. ASA directly measures cognition by recognizing different features of cognition captured in speech. Extracting features through both NLP and ASA could thus provide a unique measure of cognition and its impact on the individual and their caregivers. Early detection of MCI and ADRD can help researchers identify appropriate patients for research and help clinicians and health systems target patients for preventive care and care coordination. For these reasons, more efficient, highly scalable strategies are needed to identify people with MCI and ADRD. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to (1) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from the EHR with NLP to identify patients with CI, (2) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from ASA of audio recordings of patient-provider encounters during routine primary care visits to identify patients with CI, (3) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using both NLP and ASA extracted features to create an integrated CI diagnostic algorithm. We will develop machine learning algorithms using NLP and ASA extracted features trained against neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validate them in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. In secondary analyses we will train ML algorithms to identify MCI and its subtypes. This project will be the most rigorous development of NLP, ASA, and ML algorithms for CI yet performed, the first to test ASA in primary care settings, and the first to test NLP and ASA feature extraction strategies in combination. The multi-disciplinary team of clinicians, health services researchers, and neurocognitive and data scientists will apply machine learning to develop these highly scalable, automated technologies for identification of MCI and ADRD. 1 Project Narrative The ability of clinicians, health systems and researchers to identify patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) is limited. This project will apply machine learning to natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health record data and automated speech analysis (ASA) of patient-doctor conversations during primary care visits to identify patients with MCI and ADRD using automated and scalable procedures. The analytic algorithms will be developed with neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validated in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. 1",Natural Language Processing and Automated Speech Recognition to Identify Older Adults with Cognitive Impairment,10144364,R01AG066471,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Caregivers', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'New York City', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive care', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'adverse event risk', 'aging population', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'care coordination', 'clinical encounter', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'falls', 'feature extraction', 'financial incentive', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental state', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'screening', 'secondary analysis', 'structured data', 'success', 'testing services', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'unstructured data']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,805312
"Fine-grained spatial information extraction for radiology reports ABSTRACT Automated biomedical image classification has seen enormous improvements in performance over recent years, particularly in radiology. However, the machine learning (ML) methods that have achieved this remarkable performance often require enormous amounts of labeled data for training. An increasingly accepted means of acquiring this data is through the use of natural language processing (NLP) on the free-text reports associated with an image For example, take the following brain MRI report snippet:  There is evidence of left parietal encephalomalacia consistent with known history of prior stroke. Small  focal area of hemosiderin deposition along the lateral margins of the left lateral ventricle. Here, the associated MRI could be labeled for both Encephalomalacia and Hemosiderin. NLP methods to automatically label images in this way have been used to create several large image classification datasets However, as this example demonstrates, radiology reports often contain far more granular information than prior NLP methods attempted to extract. Both findings in the above example mention their anatomical location, which linguistically is referred to as a spatial grounding, as the location anchors the finding in a spatial reference. Further, the encephalomalacia finding is connected to the related diagnosis of stroke, while the hemosiderin finding provides a morphological description (small focal area). This granular information is important for image classification, as advanced deep learning methods are capable of utilizing highly granular structured data. This is logical, as for instance a lung tumor has a slightly different presentation than a liver tumor. If an ML algorithm can leverage both the coarse information (the general presentation of a tumor) while also recognizing the subtle granular differences, it can find an optimal balance between specificity and generalizability. From an imaging perspective, this can also be seen as a middle ground between image-level labels (which are cheap but require significant data for training—a typical dataset has thousands of images or more) and segmentation (which is expensive to obtain, but provides better training data—a typical dataset has 40 to 200 images), as the fine-grained spatial labels correspond to natural anatomical segments. Our fundamental hypothesis in this project is that if granular information can be extracted from radiology reports with NLP, this will improve downstream radiological image classification when training on a sufficiently large dataset. For radiology, the primary form of granularity is spatial (location, shape, orientation, etc.), so this will be the focus of our efforts. We further hypothesize that these NLP techniques will be generalizable to most types of radiology reports. For the purpose of this R21-scale project, however, we will focus on three distinct types of reports with different challenges: chest X-rays (one of the most-studied and largest-scale image classification types), extremity X-rays (which offer different findings than chest X-rays), and brain MRIs (which present a different image modality and the additional complexity of three dimensions). NARRATIVE This project is interested in developing natural language processing (NLP) methods for better understanding the spatial relationships described in the free text data within radiology reports found in electronic health record (EHR) systems. We will (i) develop an ontology, (ii) manually create a dataset for training NLP methods, (iii) develop automatic NLP methods compatible the ontology and corpus, and (iv) evaluate automatic image classification methods that use the output of the NLP system as image labels.",Fine-grained spatial information extraction for radiology reports,10116379,R21EB029575,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Encephalomalacia', 'Equilibrium', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hemosiderin', 'Human', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Limb structure', 'Linguistics', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Location', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Performance', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Training', 'Trust', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'deep learning', 'design', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'lateral ventricle', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'radiological imaging', 'scale up', 'spatial relationship', 'structured data', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2021,195000
"Prediction of therapist cultural competency using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models PROJECT SUMMARY  Racial-ethnic minorities (REM) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals experience high levels of psychological distress. Psychological treatments can be effective in addressing mental health concerns, but disparities in quality of care still exist. Although systemic and institutional factors contribute to disparities in care, mental health providers are also critical to examine. A primary focus of efforts to understand and reduce provider contributions to mental health care disparities has been to examine cultural competency (CC), which involves a provider’s ability to navigate the cultural aspects of clinical interactions. Patient ratings of CC are generally associated with treatment outcomes and therapeutic processes. While patient perceptions of provider CC are important, a reliance on retrospective patient ratings limits what we know about how cultural identities are discussed, and the language that constitutes culturally sensitive care. Many studies of provider CC also require observers or patients to make complex judgments based on internal provider characteristics that are not reliably observable (e.g. rate provider awareness of their own cultural values). More studies are needed that examine patient-provider interactions in treatment in order to assess the impact of specific provider behaviors, and how they relate to perceptions of provider CC. Recently, Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have been applied to psychotherapy conversations to automatically capture the use of evidence based treatments, topics of conversation, empathy, and emotional expression. Prior research demonstrating the feasibility of automatically identifying topics of conversation in psychotherapy suggest that NLP models could be trained to automatically identify specific moments in sessions where patients and providers are talking about cultural issues. NLP models could allow researchers to not only examine how specific patterns of provider-patient interactions drive CC, but might also provide rapid feedback to providers, and in turn help address disparities in care. The purpose of the current study is to do the foundational work to develop and evaluate NLP tools that capture the cultural content of provider-patient interactions among REM and LGBTQ patients. First, utilizing 32,436 labeled talk turns from 200 psychotherapy sessions we will evaluate the accuracy of NLP models in recognizing the discussion of cultural topics in psychotherapy. Second, we will use NLP models to explore differences in the content of 1,235 psychotherapy sessions that were rated as highly positive or negative on a measure of cultural competence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although disparities in the quality of mental health treatment for racial-ethnic minority (REM) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) patients are well known, to date there are no tools that can identify specific patterns of provider-patient interactions that drive disparities in care. This project will evaluate the ability of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to recognize discussion of cultural topics in psychotherapy among REM and LGBTQ patients, and explore differences in patient-provider interactions with low and high patient ratings of provider cultural competency.",Prediction of therapist cultural competency using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models,10126722,F31MD014941,"['Address', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Awareness', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Discrimination', 'Empathy', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychotherapy', 'Quality of Care', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Suicide', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'base', 'commercial application', 'community setting', 'cultural competence', 'cultural values', 'disparity reduction', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health care disparity', 'improved', 'provider behavior', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'racial and ethnic', 'sexual identity', 'showing emotion', 'substance abuse treatment', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'treatment disparity', 'university student', 'willingness']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F31,2021,46036
"National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2): Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives Project Summary and Abstract Narratives of electronic health records (EHRs) contain useful information that is difficult to automatically extract, index, search, or interpret. Natural language processing (NLP) technologies can extract this information and convert it in to a structured format that is more readily accessible by computerized systems. However, the development of NLP systems is contingent on access to relevant data and EHRs are notoriously difficult to obtain because of privacy reasons. Despite the recent efforts to de-identify and release narrative EHRs for research, these data are still very rare. As a result, clinical NLP, as a field has lagged behind. To address this problem, since 2006, we organized thirteen shared tasks, accompanied with workshops and journal publications. Twelve of these shared tasks have focused on the development of clinical NLP systems and the remaining one on the usability of these systems. We have covered both depth and breadth in terms of shared tasks, preparing tasks that study cutting-edge NLP problems on a variety of EHR data from multiple institutions. Our shared tasks are the longest running series of clinical NLP shared tasks, with ever growing EHR data sets, tasks, and participation. Our most popular three data sets have been cited 495 (2010 data), 284 (2006 de-id data), and 274 (2009 data) times, respectively, representing hundreds of articles that have come out of these three data sets alone. Our goal in this proposal is to continue the efforts we started in 2006 under i2b2 shared task challenges (i2b2, NIH NLM U54LM008748, PI: Kohane and R13 LM011411, PI: Uzuner) to de-identify EHRs, annotate them with gold- standard annotations for clinical NLP tasks, and release them to the research community for the development and head-to-head comparison of clinical NLP systems, for the advancement of the state of the art. Continuing our efforts under National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) based at the Health Data Science program of the newly established Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, we aim to form partnerships with the community to grow the shared task efforts in several ways: (1) grow the available de-identified EHR data sets through partnerships that can contribute to the volume and variety of the data, and (2) grow the available gold-standard annotations in terms of depth and breadth of NLP tasks. Given these aims and partnerships, we plan to hold a series of shared tasks. We will complement these shared tasks with workshops that meet in conjunction with the Fall Symposium of the American Medical Informatics Association and with journal special issues so that advancement of the state of the art can be sped up and future generations can build on the past. Project Narrative We propose to organize a series of shared tasks, workshops, and journal publications for fostering the continuous development of clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies that can extract information from narratives of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Our aim is to grow the annotated gold standard EHR data sets that are available to the research community through partnerships and to bring together clinical NLP researchers with informatics researchers for building collaborations. We will engage the community in shared tasks and disseminate the knowledge generated by these shared tasks through workshops and journal special issues for the advancement of the state of the art.",National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2): Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Narratives,10139100,R13LM013127,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'American', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Future Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Israel', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Privacy', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Series', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Targeted Research', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical development', 'computerized', 'falls', 'head-to-head comparison', 'health data', 'indexing', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'practical application', 'programs', 'symposium', 'usability', 'working group']",NLM,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,R13,2021,20000
"Using Natural Language Processing and Crowdsourcing to Monitor and Evaluate Public Information and Communication Disparities about Colon Cancer Screening PROJECT SUMMARY Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and death rates are higher among Black Americans than non-Hispanic White Americans. While some CRC-related disparities have decreased (e.g., incidence and stage of presentation), disparities persist in the context of CRC screening (CRCS). Studies suggest that supportive and information-rich social networks, both online and offline, could improve CRCS among Black Americans. A growing body of evidence indicates the importance of online sources of health information seeking and scanning about CRC and CRCS, but little is known about the impact of the messages that individuals are encountering on these platforms. Research on the content and volume of messages White and Black Americans encounter from online health information sources is still unclear—particularly regarding any disparities that exist about what specific information is sought, scanned, or shared by Black Americans. There is a critical need to understand which messages resonate among populations at-risk for specific diseases (e.g., CRC) and who may have concerns about engaging in early detection behaviors (e.g., CRCS) and may face disparities in exposure to public information online. The proposed project utilizes and applies novel cancer communication surveillance approaches (e.g., natural language processing and crowdsourcing) to examine public health communication about CRC prevention and control. Aim 1 will use computational, natural language processing approaches to capture and analyze digital and social media information about CRC and CRCS to identify prominent messages, sources and types of misinformation, and information inequalities. This approach offers an efficient, effective, and responsive method to monitor (mis)information and emerging messages about CRCS. Aim 2 will use a crowdsourcing approach (wiki surveys) to assess population perceptions of public information and messages about CRCS. Recruiting nationally representative samples of White (N = 1,000) and Black American (N = 1,000) adults ages 45-74, we will use an innovative data collection procedure known as wiki surveys to rank candidate messages as potential message targets in strategic efforts to promote CRCS. For Aim 3, we will conduct a randomized controlled message trial (N = 1,600) to determine the validity of the wiki survey approach to selecting messages for targeted audience segments. We will use data collected from Study 2 to identify four sets of messages with strong arguments respective to each target audience’s rankings: highest rated messages for both audiences, highest rated messages for target in-group, highest rated messages for target out-group, and middle-/median-rated messages. We will cross those message categories with target audience (White/Black American) to test if messages selected via the wiki survey are associated with intentions to adhere to screening recommendations in the future and share CRCS messages. The project will offer evidence to help determine the validity and scalability of these novel methods, which is essential to innovate formative research and evaluation approaches in the future. PROJECT NARRATIVE Efforts to improve public health communication about colorectal cancer (CRC) and CRC screening (CRCS) require understanding what information is commonly seen by target audiences and consideration of existing information and behavior disparities for populations at higher risk for CRC (e.g., Black Americans). The current project uses novel computational approaches to monitor the public communication environment about CRCS, crowdsourcing to engage in formative evaluation of possible message content, and a randomized, controlled trial to validate these computational and crowdsourcing approaches. The project tests novel approaches to monitor and evaluate public health information to inform health communication research and practice.",Using Natural Language Processing and Crowdsourcing to Monitor and Evaluate Public Information and Communication Disparities about Colon Cancer Screening,10187999,R37CA259156,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohols', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Communication Research', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Death Rate', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Policy', 'Health Promotion', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Information and Media', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Public Opinion', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respondent', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'United States', 'Woman', 'caucasian American', 'colon cancer screening', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'digital media', 'efficacy trial', 'evidence base', 'experimental study', 'formative assessment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'recruit', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'social media', 'wiki']",NCI,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R37,2021,396908
"Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period affects up to 15% of US mothers, imposing costs on mother, child, and society. Early detection can significantly reduce the incidence of depression, yet depressive symptoms are often missed during prenatal visits, which tend to focus on maternal and fetal physical health, leaving less time for maternal mental health. Even if mental health is addressed during prenatal care, women may not feel comfortable answering questions that are perceived to be embarrassing or invasive. Failing to detect depression is even more likely during the postpartum period due to infrequent physician visits once the baby has been born. Measurement in the form of daily journals, which can be analyzed using natural language processing, can promote early and more frequent detection of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Study Aims: 1) Model which dynamic features of language used over time best predict changes in depression status in the pregnancy and postpartum periods, creating phenotypes of depression risk; 2) examine how the language patterns that predict depression differ for African-American and Caucasian women; and 3) identify the relationship between the characteristics of what depressed peripartum women say and their treatment-seeking behavior. Innovation: The proposed research is innovative in its use of high frequency natural language measurements, captured in daily journals using a smartphone app, combined with advances in natural language processing models, to assess the onset and trajectory of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This is the first prospective longitudinal study using natural language collection for risk prediction in a clinical population and the first to: 1) characterize the critical topics women discuss during the peripartum period over time using open-ended journals; 2) evaluate multiple facets of language to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between language and depression; 3) use a longitudinal design approach allowing for optimal modeling of language changes associated with depression onset. Methodology and Expected Results: Monthly depression risk identified from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. will be collected through the MyHealthyPregnancy smartphone app, a mobile health application developed through close collaboration between decision scientists, clinicians, statisticians, and local peripartum women. A daily journal embedded in the MyHealthyPregnancy app will collect natural language text from the participants for 10 months (from their first prenatal visit through two months postpartum). Using three distinct natural language processing algorithmic approaches, this study will characterize how the natural language used by peripartum women in their daily journal entries is connected to the onset and experience of peripartum depression, as measured through monthly-administered depression scales. Group- based trajectory modeling will then classify women according to the patterns in their depression scores over time. Potential Impact: This work lays the foundation for developing and evaluating real-time interventions that could be deployed at scale to women who are using language that signals high depression risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will examine how the topics (the people and events mentioned), sentiment (the positive, negative, and neutral affect), and other aspects of language expressed in daily journal entries correspond to diagnostic measures of depression and treatment-seeking in a peripartum clinical population. Psychometric and daily journal entry data will be gathered through an existing smartphone app, MyHealthyPregnancy, which monitors risk and delivers actionable information as part of routine prenatal care provided to the pregnant members of a large regional healthcare system.",Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App,10111569,R21MH119450,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Disclosure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure to Thrive', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postpartum Depression', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Psychometrics', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'fetal', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'motherhood', 'natural language', 'patient subsets', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'pregnant', 'racial disparity', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'routine screening', 'smartphone Application', 'social culture', 'sociodemographics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'time use', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,194684
"Identifying the neural structures and dynamics that regulate phonological structure The systematic patterning of language is a fundamental property of cognition. One aspect of this patterning, constraints on the combination of speech sounds to form words (phonotactic structure), has been implicated in constraining diverse processes related to language acquisition, perception, and production, bilingual language use, memory and even influences non-linguistic processes including the memorability of novel words and consumer reaction to novel brand names. This patterning changes in a variety of common acquired and developmental communication disorders. We will explore two explanations for these effects. One, developed in linguistic theory, argues that language users discover a set of abstract, language-specific rules or constraints that shape language use. The other view, developed in connectionist and dynamic systems theory, argues that phonotactic constraints emerge from top-down lexical influences on speech perception. Discriminating between these approaches is difficult because both explain behavioral data well. It is essential to discriminate between these accounts for two reasons. This question offers an excellent opportunity to resolve the debate over whether abstract linguistic rules/constraints create or simply describe the patterning of language. The resolution of this question has fundamental implications for the way linguistic formalism and connectionist simulations relate to human processing. At a more immediate level, this research offers the opportunity to identify a common core mechanism (either the leveraged use of abstract linguistic rules or top-down lexical influences) that explains and unites diverse linguistic and cognitive phenomena. Past efforts to resolve these issues have failed because of fundamental inferential limitations of behavioral and BOLD imaging paradigms. Accordingly, we have developed new tools and research strategies that allow us to identify patterns of directed interaction between brain regions (effective connectivity), and use these analyses to draw much stronger inferences about the dynamic processes that shape cognition. Observers in the field have argued that our methods have already provided “definitive” evidence to resolve the decades old debate over the role of top- down processes in speech processing. This proposal would extend those methods, and introduce innovative neural decoding analyses that we will use to characterize the categories (e.g. rules, words, abstract phonological representations needed to support rule application) that are encoded in localized brain activity. Using these methods, we will determine whether top-down lexical processes that we have shown produce phonotactic phenomena related to the processing of patterns that occur in speaker's language generalize to unfamiliar patterns. We will also use them to identify the substrates of rule- versus word-mediated processing, to provide a baseline for interpreted the representations and dynamic processes that support phonotactic effects in natural language processing. The human ability to learn and use language is the result of a complex set of dynamic brain processes that can break down as the result of disease, injury or developmental disorders. This work uses new non-invasive techniques to observe and understand some of the most fundamental brain processes that shape language learning and use so that we may better understand how they break down. This understanding should one day guide the development of better ways to treat diverse language disorders.",Identifying the neural structures and dynamics that regulate phonological structure,10146334,R01DC015455,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algebra', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Common Core', 'Communication impairment', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Structure', 'Structure of supramarginal gyrus', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'bilingualism', 'developmental disease', 'dynamic system', 'experience', 'innovation', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'phonology', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'speech processing', 'theories', 'tool', 'word learning']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,427761
"Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders Improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, progress in testing these treatments is limited by the lack of informative outcome measures to indicate whether or not an intervention or treatment is having the desired effect on a child's conversational use of language (i.e., discourse skills). The long-term goal of the proposed renewal project is to harness the benefits of NLP to impact functional spoken language outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The goal of the parent R01 (R01DC012033) is to develop and validate new Natural Language Processing (NLP) based methods that automatically measure discourse-related skills, including language productivity (talkativeness), grammar and vocabulary, and discourse, based on raw (i.e., not coded or annotated) transcripts of natural language samples. Our objective in this proposal is to take the next step to evaluate the suitability of these NLP-based measures as outcomes for children with a range of intellectual abilities, language levels, and diagnoses. NLP algorithms require choices of pivotal parameter settings, such as word frequency dependent weights. While our previous results, involving between-group contrasts, were insensitive to these settings, our proposed project, involving psychometric quantities such as validity, may be sensitive to them. Building on our progress from the parent R01, we propose to pursue three specific aims: (1) Identify pivotal parameter settings that optimize stability of NLP discourse measures, and examine responsiveness to real change; (2) Evaluate consistency of NLP discourse measures, and identify key measurement factors that impact consistency; and (3) Evaluate validity of NLP discourse measures, and differences in validity as a function of diagnostic group, age, IQ, and language ability. Our approach will focus on optimizing stability of such measures, and assessing responsiveness to change over time, consistency across sampling contexts and different sample lengths, and validity of each measure. The contribution of the proposed project will be to systematically assess the psychometric properties of NLP discourse measures. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by taking the crucial next step: the development of scalable, psychometrically sound measures of discourse skills that can be used to assess between-group differences as well as within-individual change over time. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to result in viable spoken language outcome measures for children with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, making it possible to target and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions. Ultimately, the successful completion of this study will provide the immediate ability to scale up treatment evaluations involving measurement of spoken language use, allowing flexible data collection across sites and studies, and in the future provide new targets for to-be-developed behavioral and pharmacological interventions. The proposed research is relevant to public health because improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders, and outcome measures that are automated, quantitative, scalable, and objective are needed to evaluate these treatments. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of NIH because it contributes to the development of fundamental knowledge about the spoken language use among children with a range of neurodevelopment disorders and conversational language difficulties, and will make it possible to target spoken language and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions.",Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders,10132284,R01DC012033,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stereotyping', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'common treatment', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'indexing', 'informant', 'innovation', 'language outcome', 'natural language', 'neurodevelopment', 'parent project', 'scale up', 'skills', 'sound', 'symptomatic improvement', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,576876
