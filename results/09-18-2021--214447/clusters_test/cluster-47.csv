"Ex vivo single molecule tools to analyze membrane receptor dynamics Membrane receptors play a crucial role in many physiological processes throughout the body by mediating communication between cells. Single molecule imaging has been used extensively to study membrane receptor assembly and stoichiometry in vitro using isolated protein and to a lesser extent cell culture. While studies in isolated cellular systems provide insight into many processes, they lack the context of the complex environment present in an animal where communication between cell types residing in tissue is critical for receptor activity. Single- molecule imaging of native proteins synthesized in vivo would provide a direct approach to measure processes, such as receptor dimerization, that regulate physiological activity. However, current methods are not capable of applying single molecule techniques to study the regulation of protein dynamics taking place within the complex environment of an animal. We have made recent advances in the development of ex vivo single molecule techniques to monitor changes in protein assembly that occur within specific organs. The goal of this proposal is to develop and validate ex vivo single molecule tools that provide new capabilities to monitor the properties of oligomeric membrane receptor assembly, resolve cell type and subcellular region specific single membrane receptors, and automate single molecule data analysis using a machine learning platform. This novel ex vivo technology will enable researchers to take a snap shot in time of the membrane receptor dynamics that took place in the mouse and monitor changes in membrane receptor assembly in response to changes in the animal's physiological environment such as disease and exposure to therapeutics. Membrane receptors are important therapeutic targets for many diseases and are expressed throughout the body. Understanding the role of receptor assembly in the complex environment of a live animal is an important step in understanding their mechanism of activation and regulation. We will develop ex vivo single-molecule methods that for the first time will enable quantitative studies of stoichiometry for receptors extracted from mice.",Ex vivo single molecule tools to analyze membrane receptor dynamics,10207891,R01GM138837,"['Address', 'Animal Communication', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiac', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimerization', 'Disease', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Property', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'RyR2', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vesicle', 'alpha-SNAP', 'animal tissue', 'base', 'cell type', 'cluster computing', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'molecular imaging', 'nanoscale', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'open source', 'postsynaptic neurons', 'presynaptic', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'response', 'sex', 'single molecule', 'stoichiometry', 'technique development', 'therapeutic target', 'tissue preparation', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2021,299122
"A knowledge graph framework for automated gating analysis of cytometry data Project Summary / Abstract Flow and mass cytometry provide multiparametric single-cell data critical for understanding the cellular heterogeneity in various biological systems. Modern polychromatic flow cytometers simultaneously measure about 16 parameters routinely. The next-generation mass cytometry (CyTOF) technology allows for the simultaneous measurement of 50 or more parameters. Even as the cytometry technology is rapidly advancing, approaches for analyzing such complex data remain inadequate. The widely-used manual gating analysis is knowledge-driven and easy-to- interpret, but it is subjective, labor-intensive, and not scalable to handle the increasing complexity of the data. Recent developments of automated data-driven algorithms are able to address the issues of manual gating, but the results from data-driven algorithms are often not intuitive for biology experts to interpret. These limitations create a critical bottleneck for flow and mass cytometry analysis. The overall objective of this application is to develop a novel framework that combines both knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches to achieve automated gating analysis of flow cytometry and CyTOF data. The specific aims are: (1) build knowledge graphs to capture existing knowledge of manual gating analysis, (2) develop algorithms for automated gating analysis, and (3) validate the knowledge graph framework using large-scale studies in ImmPort. The proposed research is significant because it will enable efficient and reproducible gating analysis and provide visualizations that are easy-to-interpret, both of which are critically important to the research community. Such contributions will fundamentally impact single-cell analysis of cellular heterogeneity in diverse fields including immunology, infectious diseases, cancer, AIDS, among others. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is expected to develop novel computational methods for automated analysis and interpretation of single-cell analysis by flow and mass cytometry.

"EFFICIENT METHODS FOR CALIBRATION, CLUSTERING, VISUALIZATION AND IMPUTATION OF LARGE scRNA-seq DATA Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiling provides an unprecedented opportunity to conduct detailed cellular analysis of cell subpopulations. Fulfilling the promise of scRNA-seq for biomedical studies and biomarker discovery requires robust computational approaches to support detection of rare phenotypes and unanticipated cellular responses. Current approaches for imputation, calibration, clustering and visualizing of scRNA-seq data suffer from challenges such as erroneous imputing of non-expressed genes, limitation of linear assumptions in removal of multivariate batch effects, and inefficiencies of clustering and dimensional reduction methods of very large datasets. We have developed spectral, neural network, and Fast Multipole Methods (FMM) prototypes suitable for addressing these issues in the context of scRNA-seq and other high throughput data contexts and propose to further develop and adapt these methods to scRNA-seq data analysis. Our team of experts on data analytics and computational biology is currently funded through the NIH BD2K initiative to develop novel big data tools and methods that have broad applicability to biomedical science. This effort proved the feasibility of extremely efficient scalable prototypes of neural network, spectral, and harmonic analysis techniques suitable for calibrating, reducing the dimensionality and visualizing high dimensional data, finding intrinsic state-probability densities, and co-organizing cells, markers and samples. We propose substantial advances over existing analytical procedures used in single cell RNA-seq studies including matrix recovery approaches for the sparse and noisy scRNA-seq data by combining matrix completion and statistical techniques (Aim 1A), and calibration based on our unsupervised MMD-ResNet neural network prototype and optimal transport theory (Aim 1B). We will develop a variant of the FMM approach to speed up the calculation of the repulsion term of the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization technique, which will improve our current fastest t-SNE FFT-based FIt-SNE prototype, and develop new reliable approximate nearest neighbors approaches to speed up the computation of the attraction term of t-SNE and other clustering algorithms (Aim 2A). Our additional variants of t-SNE will be further developed to allow better separation between clusters of cell subpopulations (late exaggeration) and better visualization using 1D t-SNE for heatmap gene-cell representation (Aim 2A). We will adapt SpectralNet, our efficient neural network approach, for computing graph Laplacian eigenvectors for large datasets. This will enable computation of spectral clustering, diffusion maps and manifold learning that are utilized in many scRNA studies but are currently limited to a moderate number of single cells (Aim 2B). Finally, we will develop a kernel based differential abundance algorithm to characterize differences between biological conditions (Aim 2C). We will adopt appropriate sampling approaches to significantly improve current methods. This research plan aims at developing scalable spectral computational and neural network tools suitable for analyzing very large single cell RNA sequencing datasets. Specifically, our team which is led by a computational biologist, two prominent applied mathematicians and two prominent biologists will develop and validate scalable and novel techniques for: (i) completing missing values prevalent in these measurements, (ii) removing batch effect, (iii) reducing dimensionality and visualizing very large single cell RNA sequencing datasets and enabling detection of rare cell populations as well as detecting minute changes of cell populations between biological conditions.

"Single Cell Transcriptomic and Genetic Diversity by Single Molecule Long Read Sequencing PROJECT SUMMARY Defining the features of cellular mixtures, where diverse cell types with distinct genomic characteristics are physically intermingled together, is a central problem in biology. During the past decade, single cell sequencing technologies have enabled a new era of high throughput and high resolution interrogation of cell type diversity, vastly expanding our understanding of the role that cell types play in development and disease. Yet, current studies in single cell genomics rely on short-read sequencing and thus suffer from limitations, including: (1) Most studies rely on short read counting which limits the study of alternative splicing. (2) Cell states are reflected by static snapshots, and while population dynamics can be deduced through trajectory and RNA velocity estimation, robust estimation of these parameters remains a major challenge. (3) Despite advances in single-cell DNA sequencing, there is yet no cost-effective way to simultaneously characterize both the genetic variants and transcriptome-level changes in a cell, which is crucial for diseases such as cancer. This proposal is motivated by technological breakthroughs in single-molecule sequencing (SMS) and the recent adaptation of SMS to the massively parallel sequencing of single cell transcriptomes in our lab. We propose to develop computational methods to harness the power of SMS in single cell transcriptomics. In particular, we have developed a new genomic approach which allows one to repeatedly interrogate complete transcripts from single cells using SMS long reads, rather than 3' or 5' counting with short reads. This technology allows experimental designs where specific transcript subsets and/or cellular subsets can be repeatedly targeted for deeper joint short and long read analysis over many iterations, which we will exploit to conduct analyses that were previously intractable.

"A ""Culture"" Shift: Integrated Bacterial Screening and Antibacterial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Bloodstream Infections PROJECT SUMMARY The ability for clinicians to effectively treat bacterial infections with targeted antibacterials in the acute-care settings hinges on diagnostics capable of identifying the pathogen broadly and determining its susceptibility to antibacterials in a timely manner. Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a particularly representative disease because it is the leading cause of death due to infections with rapid disease progression. Unfortunately, the inconvenient delay of blood culture for definitive diagnosis contributes to widespread empiric use of broad- spectrum antibacterials and emergence of multi-drug-resistant pathogens. Toward addressing this critical unmet need, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform that integrates bacterial detection, species identification (ID), and antibacterial susceptibility testing (AST) from blood samples in a streamlined test. The expected sample-to-answer turnaround time is 90 min for ID and as early as 2-3 hr for AST. Such integrated diagnostic solution within the proposed timeframe will transform acute-care clinicians’ ability to establish diagnosis of bacterial infections, need for infection control, and antibacterial treatment based on objective data to improve clinical outcome. Using an innovative microfluidic digital array chip for assaying single cells as a backbone technology, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform which promises rapid ID and AST and allows customizable workflow and assay tailored to the clinical scenario while adjustable based on real-time results. The array chip seamlessly integrates digitization of cells, brief incubation (under various drug conditions), single-cell PCR (scPCR) or reverse transcriptase PCR (scRT-PCR) and single-cell high-resolution melt (scHRM). Thereby, bacterial pathogen can be detected at the level of single-cells, identified based on species- specific melt curves, and their antibacterial susceptibility profile subsequently assessed by measuring changes in rRNA level as a biosynthetic marker of cell viability. ScPCR/scRT-PCR enables sensitive detection and absolute quantification of rRNA of individual cells critical to rapid and reliable differentiation between viable and no-viable cells; while scHRM overcomes a key limitation of bulk HRM to resolve multiple species for diagnosing polymicrobial infections or discarding contaminations. Since both ID and AST do not rely on culture, they reduce total turnaround time from days to minutes/hours. We have assembled a superb team of multi-disciplinary investigators and industry advisors with complementary expertise and strong track record of team science. We propose the following aims:1) to develop a streamlined BSI diagnostic protocol for integrated ID and AST; 2) to develop a microfluidic array chip that enables ID and AST with single-cell resolution; 3) to develop instrument and analysis programs for single- cell ID and AST; and 4) to demonstrate the single-cell diagnostic platform, we will perform analytical and pilot clinical validation studies.

"Computational tools for regulome mapping using single-cell genomic data Project Summary Understanding how genes' activities are controlled is crucial for elucidating the basic operating rules of biology and molecular mechanisms of diseases. Recent innovations in single-cell genomic technologies have opened the door to analyzing a variety of functional genomic features in individual cells. These technologies enable scientists to systematically discover unknown cell subpopulations in complex tissue and disease samples, and allow them to reconstruct a sample's gene regulatory landscape at an unprecedented cellular resolution. Despite these promising developments, many challenges still exist and must be overcome before one can fully decode gene regulation at the single-cell resolution. In particular, current technologies lack the ability to accurately measure the activity of each individual cis-regulatory element (CRE) in a single cell. They also cannot measure all functional genomic data types in the same cell. Moreover, the prevalent technical biases and noises in single-cell genomic data make computational analysis non-trivial. With rapid growth of data, lack of computational tools for data analysis has become a rate-limiting factor for effective applications of single-cell genomic technologies.  The objective of this proposal is to develop computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory landscape using single-cell genomic data. Our Aim 1 addresses the challenge of accurately measuring CRE activities in single cells using single-cell regulome data. Regulome, deﬁned as the activities of all cis-regulatory elements in a genome, contains crucial information for understanding gene regulation. The state-of-the-art technologies for mapping regulome in a single cell produce sparse data that cannot accurately measure activities of individual CREs. We will develop a new computational framework to allow more accurate analysis of individual CREs' activities in single cells using sparse data. Our Aim 2 addresses the challenge of collecting multiple functional genomic data types in the same cell. We will develop a method that uses single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), the most widely used single-cell functional genomic technology, to predict cells' regulatory landscape. Since most scRNA-seq datasets do not have accompanying single-cell data for other -omics data types, our method will also signiﬁcantly expand the utility and increase the value of scRNA- seq experiments. Our Aim 3 addresses the challenge of integrating different data types generated by different single-cell genomic technologies from different cells. We will develop a method to align single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell regulome data to generate an integrated map of transcriptome and regulome.  Upon completion of this proposal, we will deliver our methods through open-source software tools. These tools will be widely useful for analyzing and integrating single-cell regulome and transcriptome data. By addressing several major challenges in single-cell genomics, our new methods and tools will help unleash the full potential of single-cell genomic technologies for studying gene regulation. As such, they can have a major impact on advancing our understanding of both basic biology and human diseases. Project Narrative Understanding how genes' activities are controlled at single-cell resolution is crucial for studying human diseases. This proposal will develop a coordinated set of computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory programs using single-cell genomic data. These methods and tools will allow scientists to more accurately and comprehensively reconstruct gene regulatory landscape of individual cells in complex tissue and disease samples, and they can have a major impact on advancing our understanding of both basic biology and human diseases.",Computational tools for regulome mapping using single-cell genomic data,10205134,R01HG010889,"['Address', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stem Cell Development', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transposase', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'multiple data types', 'multiple omics', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'rapid growth', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,409375
"Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis to Identify Drivers of Pulmonary Fibrosis PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal for a K08 Award is motivated by two overarching goals: 1) to support the scientific and professional development of the candidate, Dr. Paul Reyfman, towards achieving his career goal of succeeding as a physician scientist and independent investigator with expertise in systems biology approaches applied to the study of chronic lung disease, and 2) to investigate whether single-cell transcriptomic profiling can provide novel insights into the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is a deadly and progressive condition for which diagnostic approaches remain imprecise and effective therapies are lacking. Together with his mentors, Drs. Scott Budinger and Luís Amaral, the candidate has developed a comprehensive training plan that will ensure Dr. Reyfman acquires new knowledge and proficiencies in developing hypotheses, designing and completing experiments, analyzing data, and communicating findings to the scientific community. As an essential component of this training plan, the candidate will employ systems biology approaches to developing tools for analysis of single-cell transcriptomic datasets generated from patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is increasingly used to investigate the pathobiology of disease in humans and as a basis for developing novel biomarkers of disease. Developing and validating tools for analyzing the rapidly growing quantity of single-cell transcriptomic data is as much of a challenge as refining techniques for generating data from healthy and diseased tissues. In particular, it is not known whether analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) data can be used to quantify accurately the cellular composition of the lung and to identify gene expression differences between health and pulmonary fibrosis. Our preliminary data suggest that scRNA-Seq of lung identifies profibrotic gene expression in patients with pulmonary fibrosis that is heterogeneous between individuals. We also found that scRNA-Seq undersampled certain constituent lung cellular populations. Accordingly, we designed this proposal to test the hypothesis that single-cell transcriptomic analysis of lung samples from patients with pulmonary fibrosis can be used to identify disease endotypes. In Specific Aim 1, the candidate will determine whether snRNA-Seq enables quantification of the cellular composition of the lung during pulmonary fibrosis. In Specific Aim 2, the candidate will develop tools for using scRNA-Seq performed on specimens obtained from patients with SSc-ILD and normal controls to gain novel insights into disease pathobiology. Over the course of this award, the candidate will gain new skills including in generating snRNA-Seq from cryopreserved lung tissue, in lung stereology, in RNA in situ hybridization, in analysis of complementary genomic datasets, and in incorporation of clinical phenotypic information into genomic analyses. Accomplishing the proposed work will provide a rigorous training program for Dr. Reyfman and will provide insights that could lead to improved therapies for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The studies outlined in this proposal will be essential for future investigations that employ systems biology approaches to investigate the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis or to develop novel biomarkers of disease. This proposal will deepen our understanding of the strengths and limitations of single-cell transcriptomic profiling technology for studying human lung samples during health and disease. These findings may form a foundation for the development of biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of response to therapy in pulmonary fibrosis, and may uncover new targets for therapy.",Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis to Identify Drivers of Pulmonary Fibrosis,10112301,K08HL146943,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alveolar', 'Alveolar Macrophages', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Bleomycin', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Cryopreservation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Donor person', 'Drug Exposure', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung Compliance', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Specimen', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized approach', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'risk stratification', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2021,162792
"Dissecting drug resistance in serial uveal melanoma biopsies using integrated, multi-modal single-cell profiling and novel machine learning tools. PROJECT SUMMARY Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare melanoma subtype with an estimated annual incidence of approximately 2000 in the United States. While most patients have excellent rates of local disease control with surgery or radiotherapy, nearly half develop metastatic disease, most frequently to the liver. Metastatic UM (MUM) is very treatment resistant and shows no significant responses to conventional chemotherapies or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). UM is molecularly characterized by canonical mutations of the Gα protein subunits (GNAQ/11), which result in hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway. Targeting this pathway with MEK inhibitors (MEKi) results in significant anti-tumor activity in vitro, and response rates of up to 14% in patients with MUM, thereby exhibiting significantly higher activity compared to other available systemic therapies. However, there remains significant potential to improve the efficacy of MEKi. To better define modifiers of MEKi sensitivity and resistance, it is important to consider the fact that most UM harbor mutually exclusive GNAQ/11co-mutations, including inactivating mutations or bi-allelic loss of BAP1 (~33%) or deleterious mutations in SF3B1 (~23%) or EIF1AX (13%), thus define distinct genomic subtypes of UM. These alterations likely provide dependencies that are not abrogated with MEKi alone, yet they may represent synthetic lethal vulnerabilities in the context of MEKi. Furthermore, there has not been a systematic evaluation of how MEKi (or any other therapy) alters cancer cell autonomous and cell non-autonomous mechanisms that could confer drug resistance. This is in part due to technical barriers and lack of in vivo models that faithfully recapitulate human MUM. In this proposal, we build on several innovations to systematically determine the impact of MEKi on the MUM ecosystem and define synthetic lethal dependencies across the UM genomic landscape and in the context of MEKi. We will achieve this in two specifim aims: In Aim 1, we will perform single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) in patients with MUM who underwent therapy with MEKi selumetinib and had serial biopsies (pre-, on- and off-therapy), and analyze these with several established analytical methods. Second, building on recent developments, we will build machine learning tools for the analysis of sequential single-cell data sets. In Aim 2, we will perform patient- informed CRISPR-screens with multi-modal single-cell RNA/protein readouts across the genomic spectrum of UM. Finally, we will perform genome-scale CRISPR-screens across multiple models to define genotype-shared and -unique modifiers of MEKi responses. Together, these approaches will provide the a comprehensive sequential single-cell analysis in solid tumors, develop tools for temporal single-cell analyses that can be referenced against a ground truth, and define genotype-dependent synthetic lethal vulnerabilities with concurrent MEKi therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare form of melanoma that metastasizes in 50% of affected patients, which is associated with treatment resistance poor survival. There is currently no Food-and-Drug-Administration (FDA)- approved therapy for patients with metastatic UM, but MEK inhibitors (MEKi) are promising. Here, we will use a broad spectrum of single-cell genomic, genome-editing and machine-learning tools to define drug resistance to MEKi and potential synthetic lethal vulnerabilities across the distinct genomic landscape of UM.","Dissecting drug resistance in serial uveal melanoma biopsies using integrated, multi-modal single-cell profiling and novel machine learning tools.",10290692,R21CA263381,"['Affect', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Biopsy', 'CRISPR screen', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cues', 'Cutaneous', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecosystem', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Freezing', 'GNAQ gene', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Liver', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'MAP Kinase Gene', 'MAPK Signaling Pathway Pathway', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Melanoma Cell', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protein Subunits', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Radiation therapy', 'Resistance', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specimen', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Uveal Melanoma', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'chemotherapy', 'combinatorial', 'disorder control', 'experience', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'molecular subtypes', 'multimodality', 'mutational status', 'novel', 'preclinical study', 'prospective', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2021,189338
"Stanford Tissue Mapping Center HuBMAP Supplemental Research Proposal Overview We are requesting supplemental funds for two items:  1. Development of a new computational tool based on a recently developed deep-learning network called  ORCA to use spatial features with single-cell expression data from CODEX to more accurately transfer  cell type annotations to unlabeled CODEX datasets (50% funds are requested to fund a member from  Prof. Jure Leskovec from Computer Science at Stanford University to join our efforts at the Stanford  TMC). This tool has already been used to transfer cell type annotations to unlabeled HuBMAP donor  small intestine and large intestine single cell CODEX data, already saving nearly 100 hours of  annotations required for annotating 2 donors datasets, yet does not incorporate spatial annotations to  help with cell type annotations.  2. An EvoSep Liquid Chromatography system (50% funds are requested) for scProteomics. It is one of the  few systems which can run a true low nano flow rate gradient ( <100 nl/min). Low nano flow can  dramatically improve sensitivity which is the key for the success of scProteomics using mass spectrometry. We will develop a new deep-learning network called ORCA to use spatial features within CODEX data to accurately assign cell type labels to unannotated CODEX datasets saving hundreds of hours of manual annotation. We will also use an EvoSep Liquid Chromatography system to improve our sensitivity for scProteomics for our future small intestine and colon samples.",Stanford Tissue Mapping Center,10414673,U54HG010426,"['Cells', 'Colon', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Hour', 'Human BioMolecular Atlas Program', 'Label', 'Large Intestine', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Research Proposals', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Small Intestines', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'learning network', 'member', 'nano', 'success', 'tool']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2021,100000
"Phenotypic Screening for Longevity Interventions Using Single-cell Epigenetic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in understanding the biology of aging have raised the prospect of drug interventions to promote healthy aging in humans. However, such interventions should have essentially no toxicity or side effects. In practice, the throughput of drug testing (currently conducted in animals) is one of the major limitations for identifying interventions to promote healthy aging. Hence, a challenge is to identify candidate drugs able to induce rejuvenation and/or healthy aging, with minimal side effects in a high throughput fashion. Here we propose to take advantage of a novel high content screening approach based on imaging of epigenetic landscape in single cells. To meet the challenge, we propose to take advantage of a novel technique we have developed that is rooted in the analysis of epigenome topography at the single cell level, automated microscopy, and machine learning. “Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscapes” (MIEL) captures patterns of nuclear staining of epigenetic marks (e.g. acetylated and methylated histones) and employs machine learning to accurately distinguish between such patterns. Pertinent to this application, we have tested whether MIEL approach is suitable for building a phenotypic cell-based assay for inducers of longevity at the cellular level. Our preliminary results validated MIEL assay for a high content screening application to identify novel candidate pro-longevity compounds. In sum, we have developed and validated a high content cell-based screening assay capable of identifying pro-longevity/healthy aging compounds based on their effect on epigenetic signature. Our specific Aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1. Screen for novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation. Specific Aim 2. Validation of novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation.

"Manifold representations and active learning for 21 st century biology Project Summary With the rise of high-throughput sequencing and multiplexed biotechnologies enabling single-cell multi-omics and massively parallel CRISPR experiments, the biomedical community is generating a monumental amount of data. These data promise to reveal new biology and drive personal and precision medicine. However, the sheer volume of genomic data is overwhelming current computational resources, requiring prohibitively high compute time, memory usage, and storage. My lab has been at the forefront of solving big data challenges in genomics, designing novel algorithms that enable efficient and secure analyses that were previously computationally infeasible, and that reveal novel structural, cellular, and systems biology. Drawing upon our expertise in developing scalable and insightful algorithms for analyzing genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, we aim to tackle two key data-driven challenges facing the biological community: 1) efficient, accurate, and robust characterization of tissues at the single-cell level, and 2) translating high-throughput datasets into biological discoveries via machine learning-based prediction. To solve the first challenge, we will leverage our discovery that seemingly high-dimensional sequencing data often lies on low-dimensional manifolds that capture the underlying biological state of interest. We will design algorithms that generate these compact, meaningful manifold representations of single-cell omics datasets. This will enable a number of key applications including characterizing co-expression and gene-modules that define healthy and pathologic cell states; integrating multi-modal single-cell omics datasets to more richly characterize cellular diversity; and investigating the mechanisms underlying transcriptomic diversity across tissues and developmental states. To solve the second challenge, we will take a two-pronged approach. First, we will design novel machine learning frameworks that provide a measure of confidence when predicting in unfamiliar biological states, enabling prediction that is robust to “out-of-distribution” (unobserved) examples. We will then work with our experimental collaborators and CROs to rapidly perform experimental validation of model-based predictions. Finally, we will return the experimental results to the model to further improve performance. This will enable an “active learning” feedback loop to efficiently explore a complex biological space for outcomes of interest. We will use this uncertainty-powered active learning approach to explore several pressing biological concerns such as the identification of small molecule compounds with enzymatic or whole-cell growth inhibitory properties, efficient design of spatial- transcriptomic experiments, computationally guided CRISPR perturbation experiments, and identification of functional non-coding mutations. This project will result in 1) numerous software tools with wide utility that efficiently analyze massive biological datasets and guide complex experimentation, and 2) reveal biological insights, especially into biomolecular interactions and cellular heterogeneity. Project Narrative The rise of high-throughput genomic profiling of individual cells and efficient, targeted manipulation of cellular phenotypes (including CRISPR-based genetic perturbations) promise to revolutionize our understanding of cellular biology and disease. However, realizing this revolution will require new computing paradigms that can integrate and analyze these massive datasets and suggest new biological hypotheses and experimental designs. Here we develop novel computational algorithms and software for tackling these challenges to characterize cellular diversity and improve our ability to manipulate cells to understand and treat disease.",Manifold representations and active learning for 21 st century biology,10207091,R35GM141861,"['Active Learning', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Secure', 'Software Tools', 'Spatial Design', 'State Interests', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cell growth', 'computing resources', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R35,2021,478341
