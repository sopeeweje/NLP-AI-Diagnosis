"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text Project Summary / Abstract The current proposal continues the investigation on the topic of temporal relation extraction from the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) clinical narrative funded by the NLM since 2010 (Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events, or THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org). Through our efforts so far, we have defined the topic as an active area of research attracting attention across the world. Since its inception, the project has pushed the boundaries of this highly challenging task by investigating new computational methods within the context of the latest developments in the fields of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and biomedical informatics (BMI) resulting in 60+ publications/presentations. We have made our best performing methods available to the community open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES; ctakes.apache.org). In 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, we organized an international shared task (Clinical TempEval) on the topic under the umbrella of the highly prestigious SemEval, thus inviting the international community to work with our THYME data and improve on our results. Clinical TempEval has been highly successful with many participants each year, resulting in new discoveries and many publications. We have made all our data along with our gold standard annotations available to the community through the hNLP Center (center.healthnlp.org).  The underlying theme of this renewal is novel methods for combining explicit domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical), readily available unlabeled data (health-related social media, EMRs), and modern machine learning techniques (e.g. neural networks) for temporal relation extraction from the EMR clinical narrative. Therefore, our renewal proposes a novel and much needed exploration of this line of research:  Specific Aim 1: Develop computational models for novel rich semantic representations such as the Abstract Meaning Representations to encapsulate a single, coherent, full-document graphical representation of meaning for temporal relation extraction  Specific Aim 2: Develop computational methods to infuse domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical) into modern machine learning techniques such as NNs for temporal relation extraction – through input representations, pre-trained vectors, or architectures  Specific Aim 3: Develop novel methods for combining labeled and unlabeled data from various sources (EMR, health-related social media, newswire) for temporal relation extraction from the clinical narrative  Specific Aim 4: Apply the best performing methods for temporal relation extraction developed in SA1-3 to temporally sensitive phenotypes for direct translational sciences studies. Dissemination efforts through publications and open source releases into Apache cTAKES. Project Narrative Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles. The goal of our current proposal is to automatically discover temporal relations from clinical free text and structured EMR data and create an aggregated patient-level timeline.",Temporal relation discovery for clinical text,10176589,R01LM010090,"['Address', 'Apache', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Encapsulated', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Image', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thyme', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Vision', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinically relevant', 'cohesion', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning community', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'social media', 'support vector machine', 'symptom treatment', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,531398
"Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of the project is to establish a genomic medicine learning system to accelerate genomic knowledge discovery and application in electronic health records (EHRs). We will integrate deep characteristic phenotypes extracted from EHRs and evolving knowledge of genotype-phenotype associations to optimize the accuracy of variant interpretation and the cost-effectiveness of clinical genome/exome sequencing, and to accelerate the discovery of causal genes by constructing a dynamic genotype-phenotype knowledge network. Prior knowledge on phenotype-gene relationships and phenotypic information about patients can facilitate the identification of disease-causing mutations from thousands of genetic variants in the context of clinical genomic sequencing; however, how best to abstract phenotype information from notes in the EHRs of patients who are diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, standardize the computable representation of phenotypes, and utilize it in genomic interpretation remains unclear. Additionally, how to systematically compare phenotypes across diseases to discover new knowledge in human genetics remains a largely untapped area with great promise. To address these challenges, we will develop and validate scalable and portable open-source natural language processing (NLP) methods for automated and accurate abstraction of characteristic phenotype concepts (e.g., “j-shaped sella turcica” and “short stature”) from EHR narratives. We will then develop a phenotype-driven scoring system called EHR-Phenolyzer to predict the likely candidate genetic variants associated with the phenotypes for patients with genomic sequencing and a high probability of a monogenic condition. On this basis, we will develop a probabilistic disease diagnosis and knowledge discovery system using rich and deep EHR phenotypes, and evaluate these methods for genomic diagnosis and discovery using large- scale clinical exome sequencing data. Ultimately, these methods will support efficient, effective, and scalable genomic diagnostics, and facilitate the implementation of genome-guided precision medicine in clinical practice. NARRATIVE We will develop novel informatics methods to abstract characteristic phenotypes from electronic health records (EHRs) for patients diagnosed with or evaluated for monogenetic disorders, enable the interoperability of computable characteristic phenotypes with existing phenotype-genotype association knowledge such as OMIM and ClinVar, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of genomic diagnostics.",Deep phenotyping in Electronic Health Records for Genomic Medicine,10164857,R01LM012895,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'ClinVar', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'causal variant', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinical sequencing', 'cost effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'disease-causing mutation', 'disorder prevention', 'ethnic diversity', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'health record', 'human disease', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient health information', 'phenotypic data', 'pituitary fossa', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'success']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,399965
