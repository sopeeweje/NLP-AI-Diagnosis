"CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Project Summary/Abstract Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In determine an exploratory ML analysis, we will the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are strongly linked t o functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,10136105,R01MH120091,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'online delivery', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,317000
"Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use ABSTRACT: The use of prescription amphetamines for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has markedly increased in the last fifteen years, with the greatest increase in adolescents and young adults. In 2007, the FDA mandated changes to stimulant labels to warn of increases in psychosis and mania in patients without pre-existing conditions. Our multidisciplinary research team from Brigham and Women's Hospital and McLean Hospital recently published a landmark cohort study demonstrating an increased risk of psychotic episodes in new users of amphetamine compared to methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD. Alarmingly, the use of amphetamines increased four-fold over the study period (2004 – 2015). In addition, our data show that prescription amphetamine use has dramatically increased in patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder. Thus, there is an urgent need to accelerate knowledge about prescriber-level factors, patient-level factors and disease states that potentiate the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines. Large-scale studies using real-world data are the only option to study the risk of infrequent and serious adverse outcomes. In Aim 1, using incident-user cohort study designs, we will utilize data from two national administrative claims databases to identify prescriber dosing strategies that increase the risk of first-episode psychosis in ~220,000 adolescents and adults with ADHD initiating amphetamines. We hypothesize that there will be a dose-dependent increase in the risk of psychosis. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify patient subgroups at heightened risk of psychosis/mania with prescription amphetamine use. To accomplish this goal, we will perform a case control study using electronic medical records (EMR) from McLean Hospital in ~1,650 patients hospitalized for an initial episode of psychosis or mania compared to ~3,300 controls with a first psychiatric hospitalization for reasons other than psychosis or mania. We will apply natural language processing to unstructured narrative notes to capture detailed patient data not available in claims data. We hypothesize that patients with a family history of psychiatric illness will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without a family history. We also hypothesize that patients with concurrent cannabis use will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without cannabis use. Aim 3 compares the risk of treatment-emergent mania in ~52,000 new users of amphetamine versus methylphenidate in a cohort study of patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder, an urgent issue given the known risk of mania with stimulant use. Combined, these studies will provide actionable evidence to be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines with the goal of mitigating the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription stimulants. The proposed research agenda aligns with NIMH Strategic Objective 3.3 “Striving for Prevention and Cure” on testing interventions in real-world practice settings to evaluate the impact of patient- and provider-level factors on clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE: In recent years, 6.1 million U.S. children and adolescents were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 16 million adults reported past-year use of prescription stimulants. The research team recently found an increased risk of psychosis in new users of prescription amphetamines compared to new users of prescription methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD, translating to potentially increased risk of psychosis for thousands of U.S. patients. Therefore, identifying patient subgroups and prescribing practices that increase the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines has enormous public health significance and will guide providers to avoid amphetamines in patients at highest risk, preventing future cases of psychosis and mania.",Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use,10188647,R01MH122427,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amphetamine Users', 'Amphetamines', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Boston', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'First Degree Relative', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immigration', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Manic', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Modification', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Hospitals', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Ritalin', 'Sampling', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'amphetamine use', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'cost effective', 'data warehouse', 'first episode psychosis', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'patient subsets', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'provider factors', 'stimulant use', 'treatment risk', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,694144
"Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Behavioral obesity treatment produces clinically significant weight loss and reduced disease risk/severity for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease. Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes, which can be largely attributed to lapses from the recommended diet. Our work has shown that dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals) are frequent during weight loss attempts (~3-4 times per week), associated with poorer weight losses, and triggered by momentary changing states (e.g., changes in mood or availability of palatable food). Thus, there is a clear need for innovative solutions that can provide dynamic in-the-moment interventions to improve adherence to the prescribed diet in obesity treatment. Our research team was the first to develop a smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) that includes: 1) daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling via mobile device) of relevant behavioral, psychological, and environmental triggers for lapse; 2) a machine learning algorithm that uses information gathered via EMA to determine real-time lapse risk; & 3) delivery of brief intervention during high-risk moments. Our pilot work revealed that the JITAI was feasible, acceptable, and produced reductions in average lapse frequency. However, we have not yet shown a direct effect of the JITAI on eating behavior in the moment of heightened lapse risk and know little about the types of interventions that are most effective for reducing lapse. We therefore propose to extend our research via a micro- randomized trial (MRT), a methodology that involves random assignment to intervention (or control) at a specific decision point, i.e., when our algorithm predicts heightened risk for a lapse. The MRT will determine whether a specific intervention in a specific moment had its intended effect. We will therefore port our JITAI to a more scalable online platform and conduct a MRT to evaluate the effects of a generic lapse risk alert message and theory-driven just-in-time interventions on dietary lapses. After refinement testing with n=15 to ensure proper technical functioning of our updated JITAI, adults with overweight/obesity (n=159) will participate in a well-established 12-week online obesity treatment program + JITAI, with 12 weeks of JITAI-only follow-up. When an individual is at risk for lapsing s/he will be randomized to no intervention, a generic risk alert, or one of 4 theory-driven interventions with interactive skills training. The outcome of interest will be the occurrence (or lack thereof) of dietary lapse, as measured both subjectively (i.e., via EMA) and objectively (i.e., via wrist- based intake monitoring), in the hours following randomization. Results of the MRT will inform an optimized algorithm for intervention delivery that will drive the finalized JITAI. A future RCT will compare weight loss in obesity treatment with and without the optimized JITAI. This highly innovative approach will advance the science of adherence by supporting the development of sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior and informing JITAIs that target adherence to other health behaviors (e.g., medication, activity goals). PROJECT NARRATIVE This project targets dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals), a major cause of poor outcomes during behavioral obesity treatment, which is recommended as a first-line intervention for cardiovascular disease. We propose to conduct a micro-randomized trial to empirically optimize a just-in-time adaptive intervention that monitors risk and intervenes on lapses as needed. By evaluating the immediate, proximal effect of four theory-driven interventions on lapse behavior, the project will: (a) produce a scalable, finalized JITAI that has the greatest potential to show clear clinical impact in future RCTs and pragmatic trials; and (b) inform the development of more sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior more broadly.",Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial,10223435,R01HL153543,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Education', 'Energy Intake', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health behavior', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Palate', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychological Factors', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Severities', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavioral adherence', 'brief intervention', 'clinically significant', 'dietary', 'dietary adherence', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'patient engagement', 'pilot trial', 'pragmatic trial', 'prediction algorithm', 'psychologic', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'skills training', 'theories', 'treatment program']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2021,607792
"Predictive modeling of peripartum depression ABSTRACT Psychiatric problems surrounding parturition affect both the mother’s health and her child’s developmental trajectory. Peripartum depression (PPD), referring to a depressive episode occurring during pregnancy or after childbirth, is both common and morbid. PPD has been implicated in various short and long term adverse outcomes, including preterm delivery and heightened risk for mental illness in the adult offspring. In extreme cases, PPD can lead to maternal suicide and/or infanticide. Although an estimated 760,000 American women (and children) suffer from PPD each year and screening for PPD has been recommended by the USPTF, no accurate screening tool is available to adequately identify women at risk of PPD. This novel study will capitalize on the rich clinical, demographic, and laboratory information in patients’ electronic medical reports (EMRs) to improve screening for PPD. We propose to implement advanced machine learning methods to build a model to optimize identification of women at risk for PPD. We we will adopt a psycho-social- biological approach of mental illness to prospectively explore the combined effect of various disease-related factors in improving the accuracy of PPD prediction. Our dataset will make use of a sample of 20,000 women who have been followed during their obstetrical care in two leading academic hospitals in Boston. We will gather information concerning socioeconomic factors, relevant obstetric factors, and mental and physical conditions in pregnancy and disease history, as derived from laboratory test results and the patient’s report. We expect our findings to advance scientific knowledge of women at risk for PPD. Our work may lead to the development of a screening protocol that is low-cost and easily performed by health providers in clinical settings. Early identification of women at risk could potentially allow targeted interventions to reduce the prevalence and morbidity of PPD in the US. This in turn could reduce treatment costs, avoid a potentially preventable disease, and improve the quality of care and health outcomes of mothers and their children. Our study accords with the NICD high priority area of research aimed at improving the health of women during and after pregnancy and improving pregnancy outcomes. The proposed project will further the NICHD mission that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that children achieve healthy and productive lives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripartum depression (PDD) referring to the occurrence of depressive episode during pregnancy or following childbirth is a common and serious illness. While the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends universal screening for PPD, there is no accurate tool to predict women who would be at risk of suffering from PPD. The goal of this study is to test a machine learning predictive model of PPD using information in patients’ medical records to decrease PPD’s prevalence and ultimately prevent it.",Predictive modeling of peripartum depression,10131234,R03HD101724,"['Adopted', 'Adult Children', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Educational Intervention', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Etiology', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Infanticide', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive service', 'Primigravidities', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Screening procedure', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Suicide', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Treatment Cost', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'antenatal', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'health of the mother', 'holistic approach', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obstetric care', 'patient health information', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'primipara', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'tool']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,84000
"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",10149406,R01MH117559,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Americas', 'Appalachian Region', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Coin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Opioid', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poisoning', 'Poverty', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Appalachia', 'Rural Community', 'Science Policy', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'illicit drug use', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'social', 'social structure', 'sociodemographics', 'suicidal behavior', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2021,367436
"Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies (PREDICT): Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center The “clinical high risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome is an antecedent period characterized by attenuated psychotic symptoms that are marked by subtle deviations from normal development in thinking, motivation, affect, behavior, and a decline in functioning. Early intervention in this CHR population is critical to prevent psychosis onset as well as other adverse outcomes. However, the presentation of symptoms and subsequent course is highly variable, and there is a paucity of biomarkers to guide treatment development. Thus, to improve predictive models that are clinically relevant, several issues need to be addressed: 1) focusing on outcomes beyond psychosis; 2) taking into account heterogeneity in samples and outcomes; and 3) integrating data sets with a broad array of variables using innovative algorithms to overcome variability across studies. To address these challenges, the proposed “Psychosis Risk Evaluation Data Integration and Computational Technologies: Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center” (PREDICT-DPACC) brings together a multidisciplinary team of highly experienced researchers with proven capabilities in all aspects of large-scale studies, CHR studies, as well as computational expertise. The ultimate goal is to identify new CHR biomarkers, and CHR subtypes that will enhance future clinical trials. To do so, the PREDICT-DPACC will 1) aggregate extant CHR- related data sets from legacy datasets; 2) provide collaborative management, direction, data processing and coordination for new U01 multisite network(s); and 3) develop and apply advanced algorithms to identify biomarkers that predict outcomes, and to stratify CHR into subtypes based on outcome trajectories, first from the extant data and then refined and applied to the new data. The PREDICT-DPACC team has the broad, comprehensive, and robust infrastructure that is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the inclusion of multiple data types and to optimally address the needs of the CHR U01 network(s). Carefully selected extant data will be rapidly obtained, processed, and uploaded to the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). Proposed analysis methods are powerful and robust, leveraging the expertise and experience of computer scientist developers, and experienced clinical researchers. The U01 network(s) will be coordinated by a team that is experienced in managing large studies, familiar with the needs of such studies, flexible, and is knowledgeable in all aspects of CHR studies, including measures, outcomes, biomarkers, and cohorts. Upon meeting the goals of this U24, and the supported U01 network(s), the expected outcomes of the PREDICT-DPACC will be new predictive biomarkers for CHR outcomes, new definitions of CHR subtypes that are clinically useful, and new curated and comprehensive CHR datasets (extant and new) as well as processing tools and prediction algorithms that are shared with the research community through the NIMH Data Archive. NARRATIVE The “Clinical High Risk” (CHR) for psychosis syndrome in young people represents an opportune window for early intervention to prevent the onset of psychosis and other disorders, and to forestall disability; however, clinical heterogeneity and the paucity of biomarkers have hampered the development of effective intervention. To address these challenges, working with NIMH and key stakeholders, we will harmonize and aggregate existing “legacy” CHR data, and guide and coordinate the collection of new data across a network of sites, to develop biomarker algorithms that can predict individual trajectories for diverse outcomes. This proposal leverages a multidisciplinary team with broad and CHR-specific experience in large-scale multisite and multimodal studies (including clinical trials), along with expertise in data type-specific processing, coordination, analysis, and computational analyses (e.g., machine and deep learning tools from artificial intelligence, and advanced statistical approaches), ethics, community outreach, and data dissemination, all of which will ensure the success of this project.","Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration and Computational Technologies (PREDICT): Data Processing, Analysis, and Coordination Center",10256796,U24MH124629,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'FAIR principles', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Perception', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality Control', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical tool', 'attenuated psychosis syndrome', 'base', 'bioinformatics infrastructure', 'candidate marker', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical risk', 'clinical subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data archive', 'data dictionary', 'data dissemination', 'data harmonization', 'data infrastructure', 'data integration', 'data tools', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'outcome prediction', 'persistent symptom', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'quality assurance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'resilience', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'working group']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U24,2021,3917810
"Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988.

"Direct sub-second measurement of neuromodulator signaling during risky decision-making PROJECT SUMMARY Much work in decision neuroscience has been predicated on the hypothesis that dopaminergic signaling plays a critical role in value representations and their updating, and recent work has linked abnormalities in such value representations to specific features of psychiatric illness (e.g., anhedonia in major depression). However, despite the fundamental role that risk plays in evaluating choice options as well as the role sensitivity to risk plays in psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders at one extreme and health risk behaviors like substance use at another other, an understanding of the neurobiology of risk remains elusive. Indirect evidence from pharmacological studies have suggested both serotoninergic and noradrengergic signaling may play roles in representations of risk; however, direct measurement of serotonin or norepinephrine signaling during risky choice has yet to be examined in humans. Recent advances by MPI Montague’s group allow the unprecedented ability to track neuromodulator responses with high temporal resolution and chemical specificity. Specifically, MPI Montague’s team is able to directly and simultaneously measure dopamine and serotonin responses in awake humans with the temporal resolution (~ 1 ms) required to examine the relationship of neuromodulator release with decision-making processes. For signal identification and extraction, the recording method uses machine-learning algorithms (elastic net regression) combined with electrochemistry using only off-the shelf hardware and software. The product of this ‘elastic net electrochemistry’ is recordings of in vivo neuromodulator fluctuations at sub-second resolution. This application merges the decision neuroscience expertise of MPI King-Casas with these advances of MPI Montague to directly examine serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic functioning during risky choice. To achieve this goal, we will record neuromodulator responses in participants with medication-resistant epilepsy who already have intracranial depth electrodes in place for phase-II monitoring. Depth electrodes will be implanted by our neurosurgery colleagues at Virginia Tech’s medical affiliate Carilion Clinic (Carilion Clinic PI: Witcher). During recording, participants will perform i) a risk elicitation task (Holt & Laury type task) and ii) a reward learning task (multi-arm bandit task) that have been shown by our group and others both to reliably evoke neural responses associated with risk and representations as they are monitored in a standard (i.e., non-surgical) hospital suite. Depth recordings will be made using a standard montage that includes multiple contacts along the dorsal-rostral axis of the medial prefrontal cortex. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the fundamental role that risk plays in evaluating choice options as well as the role sensitivity to risk plays in psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders at one extreme and health risk behaviors like substance use at another other, an understanding of the neurobiology of risk remains elusive. Here, we take advantage of a new technology to directly measure serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine on a sub-second basis to investigate the neurocomputational role of these neurotransmitters in risky choice.",Direct sub-second measurement of neuromodulator signaling during risky decision-making,10141302,R01MH122948,"['Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Computer software', 'Decision Making', 'Dopamine', 'Dorsal', 'Electrochemistry', 'Electrodes', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morale', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology Study', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'experience', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neurosurgery', 'new technology', 'noradrenergic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'temporal measurement']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2021,654439
"EHR-based Genomic Risk Assessment and Management for Diverse Populations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recently, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide evidence for a substantial polygenic contribution to the risk of many common complex diseases. However, most of these studies were performed in Europeans, and new data and methods are necessary to tailor polygenic risk prediction to non-Europeans, to ensure that genomic stratification does not further exacerbate health disparities. The overarching goal of the eMERGE-IV network is to leverage genetic and electronic health record (EHR) data for diverse populations to design, validate and test the clinical utility of ancestry-tailored polygenic risk scores for common diseases. As a current member of the eMERGE network, Columbia University has significantly advanced its goals, having recruited over 2,500 diverse patients for sequencing and return of actionable findings, leading the effort to transition the network to the OMOP Common Data Model to improve the efficiency, accuracy, reproducibility and portability of electronic phenotypes, and contributing a widely-adopted XML parser for structuring genetic test reports. Since our last application, the Columbia Precision Medicine Initiative has also grown and now includes participation in several national initiatives, such as the All-of-Us program, in which we have demonstrated our ability to rapidly recruit patients under-represented in biomedical research. Our scientific expertise combined with our strong tradition of patient-centered research and community engagement in a socioeconomically, racially, and ethnically diverse community of Northern Manhattan, positions us to successfully contribute as the Enhanced Diversity Clinical Site of the eEMERGE-IV network. We will leverage our prior experience with eMERGE, scientific expertise, and knowledge gained from participation in other national precision medicine initiatives to develop, optimize, validate and disseminate ancestry-tailored genomic risk assessment and clinical management tools. In Aim 1, we will continue to advance electronic phenotyping by contributing sharable natural language processing tools for converting clinical text into OMOP-based discrete data and facilitating phenotype interoperability. In Aim 2, we will develop and optimize accurate ancestry-tailored genome-wide polygenic predictors, integrate them with clinical risk predictions, and test their performance in diverse populations. In Aim 3, we will investigate ELSI issues related to the return of health risk predictions to diverse patients by ascertaining patients’, clinicians’, and IRB members’ views through focus groups. In Aim 4, we will develop portable EHR plug-ins to facilitate prospective risk communication and management using integrated genomic data, family history, and clinical data. In Aim 5, we will recruit 2,500 diverse patients and use a randomized controlled trial design to assess the impact of return of genomic prediction on the accuracy of risk perception, health surveillance, and risk reducing measures. This proposal will address major knowledge gaps in genetic risk assessment for diverse populations, and the solutions and knowledge gained will be broadly applicable to precision medicine for common complex traits across many clinical specialties. PROJECT NARRATIVE Advances in precision medicine are making it increasingly possible to tailor healthcare decisions based on the individual patient’s genomic risk profile. However, large-scale validation studies of risk prediction accuracy and its clinical utility are severely lacking in diverse populations. The goal of this eMERGE-IV project is to leverage genetic and electronic health record data for diverse populations to design, optimize, validate and test the clinical utility of ancestry-tailored polygenic risk scores for common diseases of high public health impact.",EHR-based Genomic Risk Assessment and Management for Diverse Populations,10207714,U01HG008680,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Cost Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic group', 'European', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Structures', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Participant', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Stratification', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'base', 'clinical research site', 'clinical risk', 'cost effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'design', 'discrete data', 'diverse data', 'ethical legal social implication', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'genetic risk assessment', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interoperability', 'literacy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical ability', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'member', 'patient oriented', 'polygenic risk score', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'risk perception', 'risk prediction', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'structural genomics', 'tailored health care', 'tool', 'trait', 'trial design', 'underserved community', 'user centered design', 'validation studies']",NHGRI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2021,1792493
"Temperamental emotionality in preschoolers and depression risk PROJECT SUMMARY Depressive disorders (DD) are one of the most prevalent forms of mental disorders, and are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and economic costs. The incidence of DD begins to increase in early-mid adolescence and peaks in emerging adulthood. The Stony Brook Temperament Study is a longitudinal study that seeks to identify early behavioral and neural precursors and risk factors for DD and understand the neurobiological and psychosocial processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically significant psychopathology. We initially assessed a large community sample of 3-year old children, and have followed them at 3-year intervals through age 15. This competing renewal application seeks to re-evaluate the sample at ages 18 and 21. Specifically, we propose to trace pathways from laboratory observations of temperamental low positive emotionality and high negative emotionality at age 3 to neural indices of emotional and social information processing and DD symptoms and onsets from middle childhood through emerging adulthood. In addition, we seek to understand how life stress over the lifespan and the developmental challenges of emerging adulthood contribute to risk for DD, and to examine the specificity of these risk pathways in comparison with anxiety and substance use disorders. Finally, we will use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to maximize prediction of DD and understand which domains and developmental periods contribute most to prediction. This information about risk pathways and processes should contribute to understanding when and how to intervene in order to prevent DD and limit their progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depressive disorders are highly prevalent and associated with significant impairment and mortality. Rates of depression begin to rise rapidly in early-mid adolescence and peak in early adulthood.

"Integrating multi-omics data: Modeling biomarkers and mechanisms to reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by a vaginal microbiota with a low abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and higher abundances of anaerobic bacteria and affects nearly 30% of reproductive-age North American women and closer to 50% of sub-Saharan African women. BV is diagnosed by clinical observation of Amsel’s criteria (Amsel-BV), but treatment is only recommended when symptoms are reported, leaving a significant proportion of women untreated. Even with treatment, BV recurrence rates range from 50-70% within 6 months, increasing a woman’s risk of negative sequelae. Regardless of symptoms, BV is associated with serious adverse health outcomes, including preterm birth and HIV, and can seriously impact a woman’s quality of life. Ideal BV treatment would eliminate recurrence. The vaginal microbiome and microenvironment together provide a detailed evaluation of BV states, and hold key functional insights to predict and understand Amsel-BV recurrence. The goal of this proposal is to integrate and operationalize microbiome (metagenomes) and microenvironment (metabolomes and immune markers) data to develop a prognostic indicator of recurrent BV, and identify candidate biomarkers and causal mechanisms which reduce recurrence. Recent work by the PI functionally categorized the vaginal microbiome for use in large clinical research studies (vaginal metagenomic community state types, mgCSTs). The broad hypothesis in this proposal is that not all microbiomes associated with bacterial vaginosis have the same potential for recurrence. Preliminary data suggest that BV recurrence is more frequently observed in only two of the nine mgCSTs containing BV-associated bacteria. This study proposes to utilize archived cervicovaginal samples from the NIH 1999 Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Flora in which participants were followed quarterly for one year. Multi-omic analyses of baseline samples will be assessed to identify microbial (metagenomic and metabolomic) and host (metabolomic and targeted immune markers) signatures of susceptibility to recurrent BV. Specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) conduct an epidemiological analysis to evaluate the demographic and lifestyle correlates of mgCSTs, and (2) employ supervised machine learning and causal inference modeling to identify prognostic factors and drivers of the vaginal microbiome and microenvironment which lead to recurrent BV. Cases are defined as women with Amsel-BV at baseline, then clearance 3 months later, followed by recurrence at six months. Controls are women with Amsel-BV that do not experience recurrence within 9 months. This grant will support the PI’s training in epidemiology and biostatistics with the completion of a Certificate Program in Clinical Research. The PI’s long- term goal is to create an independent research program translating the basic science of the vaginal microbiome to improve women’s reproductive health outcomes. The Institute for Genome Sciences and the University of Maryland School of Medicine uniquely provide the resources and support required for successful completion of this proposal and the PI’s transition to an independent investigator. Emerging data suggest that a woman’s vaginal microbiome can protect her from acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and risk of pre-term delivery. This project will reveal how certain bacterial strains and concomitant host immune responses are associated with the recurrence bacterial vaginosis. This proposal will provide career development for the PI in clinical research, biostatistics, and epidemiology, and is relevant to the NIH’s mission to reduce infections and promote women’s health.",Integrating multi-omics data: Modeling biomarkers and mechanisms to reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence,10282850,K01AI163413,"['Affect', 'African', 'Age', 'American', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Archives', 'Atopobium vaginae', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Vaginosis', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecology', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Hygiene', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Irrigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lactobacillus', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Maryland', 'Mentors', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pelvic Inflammatory Disease', 'Pelvis', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vagina', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'aged', 'candidate marker', 'career development', 'certificate program', 'cervicovaginal', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical translation', 'complex data', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data reduction', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'genome sciences', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'model development', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'vaginal microbiome', 'vaginal microbiota']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K01,2021,92865
"The Study of the Environment and Alzheimer's disease and related Dementias (SEAD) PROJECT SUMMARY The rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is a major public health and clinical challenge in the United States. Identification of ADRD causes to inform prevention and policy is the most efficient way to address these challenges. Most research to date has focused on identifying genetic causes of ADRD, however, recent population-scale studies have shown that environmental exposures, such as lead and cadmium, also contribute to ADRD risk and etiology. Initial findings on environmental factors linked to ADRD risk is promising, but human evidence is limited. A wide range of environmental exposures (exposome) have never been evaluated systematically in relation to incident ADRD. While there is a growing demand to predict future risk for ADRS more precisely, the role of exposomic data in improving ADRD risk prediction has never been evaluated. To address these gaps, we propose a prospective cohort study by capitalizing on existing large-scale, United States nationally representative, multi-ethnic population-based data. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, from 1998-2010, n>15,000) has a variety of environmental chemical exposure measurements, behavioral risk factors, and clinical phenotypes, and when linked to Medicare data, provides up to 25 years of incident ADRD. We aim to (1) conduct a biologic hypothesis-based approach to test the associations of chronic exposure to lead and cadmium with incident ADRD; (2) conduct a data-driven environment-wide association study to systematically evaluate a wide-range of environmental toxicants with incident ADRD; and (3) develop and validate an exposome-based risk prediction model for ADRD using machine learning methods. The proposed study will advance scientific understanding on how modifiable and currently ubiquitous environmental neurotoxicants can lead to the development of ADRD. This study assesses the exposome to improve prediction of future disease risk and define vulnerable populations more precisely. This research will highlight individual-level and population-level interventions (i.e. precision health) to effectively prevent or reduce the risk of ADRD in the US population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is relevant to public health and precision health because comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of modifiable environmental exposures, including the currently ubiquitous environmental neurotoxicants lead and cadmium, will advance scientific understanding on the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and inform individual-level and population-level interventions to effectively prevent or reduce the burden of ADRD. The proposed study is directly responsive to the 2018 National Institute on Aging AD Research Summit recommendations related to Understanding the Impact of the Environment to Advance Disease Prevention and Enabling Precision Medicine Research for AD/ADRD, and to the research goal of NOT-AG-18-053, Enabling precision medicine for AD/ADRD through deep molecular phenotyping.",The Study of the Environment and Alzheimer's disease and related Dementias (SEAD),10120924,R01AG070897,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Cadmium', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurotoxins', 'Participant', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'abeta deposition', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'bone', 'chronic Pb exposure', 'clinical phenotype', 'dementia risk', 'demographics', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'effective intervention', 'environmental chemical', 'environmental chemical exposure', 'follow-up', 'human population study', 'improved', 'lead exposure', 'machine learning method', 'modifiable risk', 'molecular phenotype', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'symposium', 'tau expression', 'toxicant']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,692598
"Preventing antimicrobial resistance and infections in hospitalized neonates in low resource settings Project Summary/Abstract Annually, 2.5 million babies die within the first four weeks of life, nearly a quarter due to infectious causes. Newborns admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) are especially vulnerable, due to such factors as prematurity, an immature immune system, and need for life-sustaining invasive procedures and devices. In low and middle income countries (LMIC), an increasing number of NICUs care for premature and critically ill newborns. Healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (HA-BSI) in LMIC are more common due to inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) and more difficult to treat due to high rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Previous research in this setting focuses primarily on outbreak investigations and does not adequately describe risk factors for HA-BSI. Healthcare facilities lack effective tools to assess maternal and neonatal IPC and create improvement strategies. Preliminary data from the applicant's ongoing prospective cohort study that has enrolled over 6600 neonates in three NICUs in Pune, India, reinforces the high incidence of HA-BSI in this setting with a rate of 7.6 per 1000 patient-days, as well as high rates of AMR. Among Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, the most common BSI pathogen, 96% are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and 38% to carbapenems. Among neonates with BSI, mortality is 22%. Within the framework of this study, the following are proposed: (1) To identify modifiable risk factors for HA-BSI in the NICU; (2) To develop a model for predicting infection with carbapenem-resistant organisms (CRO); and (3) To develop and pilot a novel tool to assess IPC practices in the NICU and Labor & Delivery. Identifying risk factors for HA-BSI in the NICU will promote development of targeted IPC strategies. Creation of a prediction model using a decision tree algorithm will help identify babies at highest risk of CRO infections. Such a model can support NICU clinicians in selecting the right antibiotics when infection is suspected, reducing time to appropriate therapy and decreasing unnecessary use of last resort antibiotics such as colistin. Development of an IPC assessment tool that incorporates human factors engineering (HFE) principles will enable healthcare facilities to optimize IPC and reduce risk of hospital-acquired infections and associated mortality. This mentored research will train the applicant in advanced epidemiologic methods and application of IPC in LMIC. The applicant is a neonatologist at Johns Hopkins University committed to patient-oriented research in resource-limited settings. Her long-term goals are to become a leader in neonatal IPC in low resource settings and devise interventions to reduce global burden of HA-BSI and associated mortality. This K23 will facilitate skill development in longitudinal data analysis, prediction models, survey development, HFE, and qualitative data analysis. Training will include formal coursework, supervised data analysis, and mentorship by a team with expertise in infectious diseases, IPC, biostatistics, epidemiology, patient safety, and HFE. Collectively, the activities of this K23 will provide a pathway to an independent career as a clinical investigator with expertise in healthcare epidemiology and IPC in low resource settings. Project Narrative Worldwide, more than 600,000 newborns die from infections each year. India has one of the highest burdens of newborn deaths due to bacterial infections, which are commonly resistant to antibiotics. In this study, I will identify risk factors for newborn bloodstream infections, develop a method for predicting antibiotic-resistant infections, and create an infection prevention survey to reduce risk of infections in hospitalized babies in Indian Neonatal Intensive Care Units.",Preventing antimicrobial resistance and infections in hospitalized neonates in low resource settings,10215584,K23HD100594,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Assessment tool', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Carbapenems', 'Caring', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colistin', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Hand', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hygiene', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'India', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Infection prevention', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resort', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'biobank', 'carbapenem resistance', 'career', 'classification trees', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'critically ill newborn', 'health care model', 'healthcare-associated infections', 'high risk', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'infection risk', 'low and middle-income countries', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'neonatal care', 'neonatal death', 'neonatal infection', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient oriented research', 'patient safety', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rectal', 'regression trees', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,170876
"A Multi-Dimensional Linked Registry to Identify Biological, Clinical, Health System, and Socioeconomic Risk Factors for COVID-19-Related Cardiovascular Events PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is mounting concern that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 experience unexpectedly high rates of cardiac and vascular events. Identifying which patients are at highest risk for COVID-19-related cardiovascular events and delineating how these events affect short- and long-term outcomes may help support individualized patient care, illuminate underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and accelerate the development of effective therapies. However, little is known about how multi-dimensional risk factors, including prior medical conditions, socioeconomic indicators, and circulating levels of biomarkers affect patient outcomes. Building on our team's expertise in data linkage, prediction modeling, and biomarker discovery, we will create a unique and powerful linked data resource to characterize the biological, clinical, health system, and socioeconomic risk factors for the development of cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19 and examine their impact on health outcomes. To create this data resource, we have partnered with the American Heart Association, whose COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry is actively capturing high-quality, standardized information on all adults hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at >100 U.S. sites spanning 30 states. We will link this registry to comprehensive health care claims, a national socioeconomic deprivation index, and detailed health care system information. In Aim 1, we will apply traditional and machine learning approaches to the linked multicenter registry in order to identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among COVID-19 patients. In Aim 2, we will characterize long-term MACE (i.e., at 1 and 2 years after discharge from the index COVID-19 hospitalization) among older adults in a large multicenter registry linked with longitudinal Medicare claims, and identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict their occurrence. Based on this work, we will create clinically implementable risk scores which will estimate, at the time of admission for and discharge from an index COVID-19 hospitalization, a patient's risk of developing a major cardiovascular event. In Aim 3, we evaluate the proteomic profiles of a subset of patients in the linked registry with biobanked serial blood samples, and identify biochemical markers that predict the occurrence of MACE, both during index hospitalization for COVID-19 and after discharge. This research will advance our collective understanding of the biological, clinical, and socioeconomic predictors of COVID-19-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. By identifying patients at greatest at risk of cardiovascular events, our work will help frontline clinicians better individualize clinical management strategies and health systems improve care delivery during future waves of the pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular events (heart damage, stroke, blood clots) appear to be both common and dangerous in patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19. A better understanding of which patients are at highest risk for these events is a key step to developing better approaches for prevention and treatment. We will combine multiple sources of information, including a large national COVID-19 registry from the American Heart Association, health care data from Medicare, and blood protein levels from patients treated at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, to identify the factors that are associated with a higher risk of short- and long-term cardiovascular events among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","A Multi-Dimensional Linked Registry to Identify Biological, Clinical, Health System, and Socioeconomic Risk Factors for COVID-19-Related Cardiovascular Events",10183512,R01HL157530,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American Heart Association', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Embolism', 'Event', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Israel', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocarditis', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention approach', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care delivery', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deprivation', 'disease registry', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'heart damage', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'medical information system', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'pandemic disease', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized management', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction', 'rurality', 'socioeconomics']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,873210
"Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention ABSTRACT Vascular health has emerged as one of the most important determinants of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Early adult and midlife cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and subclinical disease may be important drivers of cognitive decline in midlife, a period that most likely is critical for influencing later life dementia risk. Yet, few studies have investigated early adulthood CVD risk exposures, including timing of exposure and whether subthreshold levels impact later life cognition. To accomplish these goals, we propose, to add cognitive testing to the Year 35 visit of the ongoing multisite Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. At baseline, CARDIA enrolled 5,115 black and white participants (mean age 24) who have been carefully followed for 30 years and had cognitive testing at visit years 25 and 30. Cognitive evaluation at Year 35 will allow us to determine 10-year cognitive change (mean age 50 to 60) at a critical time point when cognitive decline starts to diverge and potentially impacts late-life dementia risk. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine, using a life-course approach, the independent associations of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with timing, level (both subthreshold and threshold) and trend in CVD risk factors including body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, assessed over 35 years from early adult to midlife; 2) To determine the association of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with novel subclinical CVD markers over time including carotid artery intima thickness, coronary artery calcification and cardiac function; 3) To determine whether CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD markers are associated with brain aging indices in midlife, derived by the application of machine-learning neuroimaging pattern analysis to brain MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data obtained on nearly 700 CARDIA participants at midlife; Exploratory) To assess black/white disparities in 10- year cognitive decline and determine the extent to which such disparities are explained by burden of CVD risk. Guided by strong preliminary data, our main hypothesis is that CVD risk factors begin to exert influence as early as the third decade of life and that subthreshold levels (eg systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm) are important drivers for this. In addition, we hypothesize that subclinical CVD measures (especially cardiac function and atherosclerosis) are associated with greater decline in midlife cognition and accelerated brain aging. No other study in the US has such comprehensive data on a wide array of early adult CVD risk factors that may influence cognitive aging. As an experienced multidisciplinary team using innovative statistical methods to analyze essentially unique longitudinal data on early adult and midlife CVD risk factors and subclinical disease, we have the opportunity to investigate the associations of these life-course exposures with cognitive decline and brain health in midlife. Identifying dementia risk factors early in the life-course may lead to interventions to help maintain healthy brain aging and prevent the onset of dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to study how cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity may influence cognitive function changes in midlife. We will apply a life-course approach to this investigation by carefully studying how CVD risk and preclinical markers beginning in early adulthood (20s and 30s) may affect midlife cognitive functioning and brain aging. In this way, the study has great public health value as it will inform ways to possibly prevent Alzheimer disease and vascular changes in the brain.",Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention,10171753,R01AG063887,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrophic', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'aging brain', 'black/white disparity', 'brain health', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcification', 'critical period', 'dementia risk', 'early life exposure', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fasting glucose', 'heart function', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'treatment strategy', 'trend', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIA,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2021,740671
"Concussion and Driving Skills in the Young Driver PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Research Objectives. This prospective cohort study rigorously examines the neurocognitive impact of concussion on simulated and real-world driving performance among young drivers aged 16-24 years. Importance. Concussion impairs cognitive processing speed, attention, concentration and integration – skills which are also important for safe driving. Unlike new “Return to Learn” guidelines, there are no evidence-based “Return to Drive” guidelines for when individuals with concussion may be safe to return to driving. Objectives. Conduct a prospective matched cohort study to explore the risk of concussion in simulated and real-world driving conditions. We propose three specific aims and a fourth exploratory aim:  (i) Examine whether concussion negatively impacts simulated driving performance among young  drivers, relative to a cohort of young drivers without concussion.  (ii) Determine whether simulated driving task performance correlates with recovery from  concussion symptoms and signs in the month following concussion, relative to young drivers  without recent concussion.  (iii) Measure the impact of concussion and recovery on real-world driving exposure and performance.  (iv) [Exploratory] Examine whether concussion symptoms and neuropsychometric impairment are  associated with higher rates of driving citations or reported crashes. Study design. Prospective controlled matched cohort study. Setting/participants. 50 drivers with recent concussion; 50 age/gender matched controls aged 16-25 years. Study protocol. Concussion participants will be recruited within two weeks of concussion. Case and control participants will complete 1) driving risk survey; 2) neuropsychological testing an 3) simulated driving tasks at baseline and 1 month. Commercially available monitoring technology will record risky driving for 3 months Outcome measures. (i) simulated driving risk scores; (ii) real world driving risk scores (rapid braking, rapid acceleration, speeding); (iii) reported citations and crash rates. Impact. This study will have a significant population health impact in elucidating the neurocognitive sequelae of recent concussion on driving. Results will inform return to safe driving among young drivers with concussion. PROJECT NARRATIVE Concussion impairs cognitive processing speed, attention, concentration and integration – skills which are also important for safe driving.

"Diversity Supplement to Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark’s population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD and mortality later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis- generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation.

"Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease by Simulation Modeling to Improve the Health of Minority Populations Project Summary/Abstract Significant health disparities exist in chronic kidney disease (CKD), CKD progression, and end stage renal disease (ESRD) in ethnically diverse populations. African Americans (AAs) have ~25% higher prevalence of CKD, 3-fold higher rate of ESRD, and the highest risk of mortality among those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 45-95mL/min/1.73m2. The most significant traditional risk factors for CKD and ESRD are diabetes and hypertension accounting for >60% CKD and >70% of new ESRD cases, respectively. Non- traditional risk factors for CKD such as environmental, cultural-behavioral factors, geographic, education, insurance coverage, socioeconomic status and unequal access to optimal healthcare, disproportionately affect CKD health in ethnic minorities. The unique combination of these factors on CKD progression in the real world remains poorly defined. Identification of modifiable risk factors that may reduce CKD disparities would be invaluable to improve quality of life, life expectancy, and decrease economic burden. Simulation models have been successfully applied in other clinical domains, but are limited in CKD development and CKD progression, due to small datasets and the absence of modeling techniques using longitudinal observational health data. Further, no models have been tested in a real-world minority population to uncover the potential for interventional studies that would reduce CKD disparities on a larger scale. To our knowledge, we have created the largest, comprehensive database from electronic health records of >10 million individuals seen between 2006-2016 from a 2-year partnership between UCLA (1.8 million) and Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH; 9.2 million) systems. From the UCLA Registry population, we identified significant differences in eGFR trajectory decline between AAs and non-AAs according to baseline eGFR, indicating a pattern shift from a higher to a lower, steeper eGFR trajectory suggesting there may be critical windows for interventions to reduce CKD disparities in AAs. Race/ethnicity differences from linear mixed models of all ethnic cohorts persisted even after controlling for demographic and clinical variables known to influence eGFR trajectories. We hypothesize that the use of ethnically diverse populations in the joint UCLA PSJH CKD/At-risk CKD Registry can identify a novel combination of CKD risk factors; and improve the performance of existing simulation models to predict CKD progression. The specific aims are to: 1) develop and test a machine learning-based simulation model for CKD and eGFR trajectories using the UCLA PSJH CKD/At-risk CKD Registry; and conduct internal validation of the models and comparisons with existing CKD risk models, 2) stratify and test simulation models based on different racial/ethnic groups, including external validation based on cross-institution comparisons, and 3) conduct focus groups with UCLA primary care physicians, who manage racial/ethnic patients, to elicit their perspectives on existing and designed simulation models to reduce CKD health disparities. These innovative approaches will facilitate our long-term goal to inform clinical decision support methods to reduce/eliminate CKD health disparities. Project Narrative Disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affect the development of CKD and CKD progression in ethnic minorities. The ability to use large datasets of patient information to reduce these disparities is greatly lacking. We will conduct simulation modeling to identify a unique set of risk factors that predict CKD and CKD progression, that can be targeted for individualized treatment in patients with highest risk of kidney function decline, with valuable input on the potential utility of this resource from focus groups consisting of primary care physicians.",Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease by Simulation Modeling to Improve the Health of Minority Populations,10087957,R01MD014712,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Economic Burden', 'Education', 'Educational Background', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'End stage renal failure', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic group', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Planning', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Statistics', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Registries', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Environment', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Urban Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data registry', 'design', 'disease registry', 'disorder risk', 'disparity reduction', 'ethnic difference', 'ethnic diversity', 'ethnic minority population', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'minority health', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'racial and ethnic']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,374941
"Metal-nutrient mixtures in epidemiologic and toxicologic studies of cardiovascular disease Abstract This proposal is designed to extend and complement our R01-funded case-cohort study of cadmium (Cd) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Herein we will add arsenic (As), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) to our case-cohort study and include epidemiologic and toxicologic mixtures analyses. The four elements we have selected are compelling for their independent role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and as a mixture. As increases plaque formation and adhesion to endothelium and Cd also induces endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis; yet it is not clear if the effects of As and Cd are synergistic or competing. To potentially counteract these processes, Mg is important for modulating endothelial function. While Ca’s role is equivocal, its role in calcification of the arteries is undeniable, making it important to consider as well. Our efficient case-cohort study design includes 810 cases of AMI and a comparison subcohort of 600 men and 600 women selected randomly from never smokers at risk of AMI at the start of follow-up, leveraging the prospective population-based Danish Diet Cancer and Health Cohort. We are already funded to measure Cd, creatinine, osmolality, and cotinine in baseline urine samples. We now propose to additionally analyze As species, Mg, and Ca in urine among ~2000 participants selected into this case-cohort study, along with pre-existing food frequency questionnaire data on Mg and Ca. In Aim 1 we will evaluate the association between each of As, Ca, and Mg, and incidence of AMI. This will be one of the largest prospective studies of these elements in relation to AMI. In Aim 2 we will apply mixtures methods (Bayesian kernel machine regression, weighted quantile sum regression, random forests) to evaluate the interactive and joint effects of Cd, As, Ca, and Mg in relation to AMI risk. In Aim 3 we will apply in vitro and in vivo approaches to study combined effects of exposure to these elements to investigate the toxicologic mechanisms and pathways of activity. Each Aim is independently compelling and will provide important scientific contributions but together the complementary approaches have the potential to provide evidence of consistency in findings across the distinct approaches. Triangulating data across in vitro, in vivo and epidemiologic analyses represents a translational bridge as depicted in the NIEHS translational research framework. The scope of this virtual consortium will enrich our understanding of the relationships between Cd, As, Mg, Ca, and CVD. Other innovative features of our study include leveraging an existing efficient case-cohort design, large sample size, a large number of incident AMI events, controlling for tobacco smoking, in vitro assays of pro-atherogenic mechanisms, and in vivo studies of atherosclerosis. Sources of exposure to these elements are well known, therefore the identification of mixtures of these elements as cardiovascular risk/protective factors can have major implications for the prevention and control of CVD. Public Health Relevance Mechanistic and epidemiologic studies suggest a mixture of elements including cadmium, arsenic, magnesium, and calcium may play an important role in cardiovascular disease as risk and protective factors. We propose to create a virtual consortium to study chemical mixtures of these elements in relation to risk of cardiovascular disease using state-of-the-art techniques in exposure science, epidemiology, biostatistics, and cardio-toxicology. Sources of exposure to these elements are well known, therefore the identification of mixtures of these elements as cardiovascular risk/protective factors can have major implications for the prevention and control of cardiovascular disease.",Metal-nutrient mixtures in epidemiologic and toxicologic studies of cardiovascular disease,10254343,R01ES030938,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adhesions', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arsenic', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Cadmium', 'Calcium', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Cotinine', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Hypertension', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lipids', 'Magnesium', 'Measures', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nutrient', 'Osmolalities', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Questionnaires', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Side', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Toxicology', 'Translational Research', 'Urine', 'Woman', 'calcification', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cohort', 'design', 'diet and cancer', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'men', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'never smoker', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'urinary', 'virtual']",NIEHS,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2021,601096
"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia. Computational modeling will aim at developing risk and resilience predictors, essential for early identification and intervention during a dynamic period of brain maturation.",Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers,10149410,R01MH119219,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Functioning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'case control', 'childhood adversity', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'data anonymization', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'emerging adult', 'follow-up', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychiatric genomics', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'sex', 'social']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,733897
"QT prolonging medications and sudden cardiac death among individuals on hemodialysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have exceedingly high mortality, driven largely by cardiovascular events. The rate of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the HD population exceeds that of the general population by more than 20-fold. Risk factors for SCD such as structural heart disease and conduction abnormalities are common among people with end-stage kidney disease, but traditional preventive strategies, such as antiarrhythmic medications and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, do not lower SCD risk in HD patients. However, medication-provoked SCD may be preventable, and, to-date, has been understudied in HD patients. Dialysis patients are often prescribed medications that have the undesirable, off-target effect of delayed ventricular repolarization, which manifests as QT-interval prolongation on an electrocardiogram, and can trigger fatal arrhythmias. Although more than 50% of dialysis patients are prescribed medications that can prolong the QT-interval (e.g. certain antidepressants, antibiotics, antiemetics), there are critical knowledge gaps about the cardiac safety of these medications. In fact, their safety profiles rest on data obtained from healthy volunteers and have not been explicitly evaluated in HD patients. By executing the proposed studies, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of the essential safety data relevant to the prescription of non- cardiac QT-prolonging medications to HD patients. In Aim 1, we will determine the relative SCD risk of the most commonly prescribed non-cardiac medications with higher QT-prolonging potential vs. clinically relevant comparator medications with lower QT-prolonging potential among HD patients. In Aim 2, we will identify modifiable clinical factors (e.g. dialysate composition and concurrent prescription medications) that may be targeted to mitigate SCD risk from QT-prolonging medications. In Aim 3, we will identify prescribers of higher risk QT-prolonging medications and associated encounters that should prompt medication reconciliation and decision support tool use. Then, in Aim 4, we will develop individualized decision support tools for QT- prolonging medication prescribing that integrate many comorbid conditions, HD treatment, and medication- related risk factors. This work will yield decision support tools that facilitate personalized SCD risk assessments and safer prescribing of QT-prolonging medications to reduce SCD risk among HD patients. Moreover, the decision support tools generated in this project will serve as the subject of future pragmatic trials testing the impact of tool implementation on cardiovascular outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hemodialysis patients experience a disproportionately high burden of sudden cardiac death. Medication- provoked sudden cardiac death (i.e. death triggered by QT-prolonging medications) may be preventable and has not been studied enough in this population. Our project aims to uncover medication-related risk factors for sudden cardiac death and develop clinical decision support tools that will promote safer medication prescribing.",QT prolonging medications and sudden cardiac death among individuals on hemodialysis,10127698,R01HL152034,"['Antibiotics', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antiemetics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biometry', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrolytes', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Hemodialysis', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Medicare', 'Observational Study', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Potassium', 'Prevention strategy', 'Publishing', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk-Benefit Assessment', 'Safety', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Testing', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'implementation tool', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication safety', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'personalized decision', 'point of care', 'pragmatic trial', 'structural heart disease', 'sudden cardiac death', 'support tools']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,509050
"5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Summary Research suggests that if we can identify individuals at-risk for these disorders early, we may be able to improve the course of illness and hopefully prevent illness onset all together. A first generation of studies suggest that the approach of identifying those at clinical high-risk (CHR), through the use of specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a promising strategy for exploring mechanisms associated with illness progression, understanding etiology, and identifying new treatment targets. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 15-20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a handful of metropolitan centers, and requires extensively trained staff. Here, we aim to lay the foundation for a new approach to CHR assessment that will increase accessibility, and positive predictive value. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis (actively tapping into psychotic disorder-specific processes, rather than to trait vulnerability signs) and relatedly, that are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize inexpensive behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening in help-seeking as well as non-help seeking populations, that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. Before this can be accomplished however, it is necessary to determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to the first-generation prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites and in Aim 1, develop a PSDS battery risk calculator based on measures that prove to be most sensitive to imminent conversion. Further, the inclusion of a help-seeking comparison group is critical for translating the PSDS calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for developing a psychotic disorder from others forms of psychopathology. In Aim 2, we will compare the sensitivity and specificity of the PSDS risk-calculator to the North American Prodromal Study (NAPLS) risk-calculator (a gold-standard first-generation tool) in the prediction of psychosis conversion over a 2 year- period. Last, in Aim 3, the study will determine if the PSDS predicts functional outcomes over the course of 2 years. Predicting diagnosis is important but being able to provide early intervention to limit the disability characteristic of psychosis is a priority. This project will answer the preliminary questions necessary for a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods, that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview- based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,10122993,R01MH120089,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'comparison group', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'metropolitan', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'online delivery', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,579032
"Precision antimicrobial stewardship for Clostridioides difficile prevention (PASTCDI) Project Summary Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an important healthcare-associated infection and a significant driver of poor patient outcomes and preventable cost. An existing bundle of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) methods of CDI prevention are limited by difficulties identifying high-risk patients most likely to benefit from interventions. Recently we have developed a machine learning classification tool capable of accurately identify risk of developing CDI in hospitalized patients. Here we propose adding and rigorously testing this highly innovative precision medicine approach to CDI prevention within a robust, real-world AMS infrastructure Objective: To decrease CDI incidence by implementing an electronic health record-integrated CDI-risk classification tool within a framework of precision-medicine AMS. Specific Aim: Measure the effect of implementing a real-time CDI-risk classification tool to guide AMS efforts for CDI prevention among high-risk patients. The primary outcome will be hospital-associated CDI incidence. We will measure outcomes in patients identified as high-risk by the risk classification tool, comparing a 24- month pre-implementation period with a 12-month post-implementation period using interrupted time series (ITS) segmented regression. Secondary outcomes will include antimicrobial utilization rates, CDI test ordering, hospital length of stay, total cost, tool use, and AMS satisfaction Hypothesis: We hypothesize that tool implementation will result in a 35% relative reduction in CDI incidence, which aligns well with the lower end of estimates of bundle effect in prior studies. Significance: While evidence supports the efficacy of AMS interventions for CDI-prevention in general, our proposal is the first to our knowledge to employ a precision-medicine approach to CDI prevention. This high- impact, precision medicine proposal, based on extensive, sound preliminary data has a high probability of success. Project Narrative Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an epidemic in hospitalized patients, and current prevention strategies are limited by difficulties identifying patients most likely to benefit from interventions. We developed a machine learning classification tool capable of accurately estimating risk of CDI.

"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,10265645,U01AI131344,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Age-Months', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Eczema', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Feces', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Home environment', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Measures', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Mennonite', 'Milk', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neonatal', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Secretory Immunoglobulin A', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Systems Development', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vaginal delivery procedure', 'animal data', 'atopy', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'dietary', 'early onset', 'food allergen', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'infancy', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microorganism antigen', 'mucosal site', 'neonate', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'response', 'support vector machine', 'urban setting']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,U01,2021,245245
"Prediction of imminent sudden cardiac death based on warning signs Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), a sudden catastrophic loss of the pulse, affects >350,000 in the US annually. Most will suffer sudden cardiac death (SCD) within 10 minutes of presentation, yielding a mortality rate >90%. Based on our recent work, we have proposed a novel paradigm for SCD called “near-term prevention”. SCA is often not as sudden as one might expect. At least 50% of individuals will have warning symptoms at some time in the 4 weeks prior to SCD, but these can be non-specific, so are often not acted upon. The overall goal of this proposal is to refine the identification of the symptomatic individual at high-risk of SCD, during this 4-week window of opportunity. We propose that a simultaneous examination of symptoms, clinical factors and biomarkers may identify individuals at highest risk of imminent SCD, which could enable prediction and pre-emptive management, thereby preventing SCD. We are proposing to develop a comprehensive risk score from two population-based studies founded by the PI. The Portland, Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (Oregon-SUDS, catchment area ≈ 1 million) is now in its 17th year and the Ventura, California PRESTO study (Prediction of Sudden Death in Multi-Ethnic Communities, catchment area ≈ 850,000) is in its 5th year. The resulting combined databank contains information on >7500 SCD cases and controls, with detailed clinical phenotyping and a biobank of plasma samples. From Oregon-SUDS, we recently reported that 51% (n=430) of 839 individuals who suffered SCD presented with at least one symptom within the 4 weeks prior to their lethal event. The main symptom was chest pain, but dyspnea, fatigue, syncope and palpitations were also recorded. Warning signs could represent an opportunity for near-term prediction of SCD. While these symptoms are common and may be non-specific for SCD, we hypothesize that a combination of specific symptoms and clinical profile could facilitate the identification of patients at high risk of impending SCA. In addition, the discovery of novel plasma biomarkers for SCD could have additional utility for risk stratification. We therefore hypothesize that biomarkers, when combined with specific symptoms and clinical profile, will maximize the likelihood of identifying symptomatic subjects at highest risk of SCD, allowing for early intervention. SCD remains a major public health problem with a critical need for novel prediction and prevention.

"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,10128367,U01AI131344,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Age-Months', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Eczema', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Feces', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Home environment', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Measures', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Mennonite', 'Milk', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neonatal', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Secretory Immunoglobulin A', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Systems Development', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vaginal delivery procedure', 'animal data', 'atopy', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'dietary', 'early onset', 'food allergen', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'infancy', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microorganism antigen', 'mucosal site', 'neonate', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'response', 'support vector machine', 'urban setting']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,U01,2021,436080
"Improving the Accuracy of ASCVD Risk Estimation Using Population-Level EHR and Genetic Data SUMMARY Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASVD) is the primary mechanism for the development of CVD and is largely considered preventable by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Lipid-lowering therapy is the current mainstay of preventative treatment for ASCVD and guidelines for pharmacotherapy rely on the 2013 Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) for estimating 10-year risk. While these equations have been validated at a population level they have significant shortcomings that impact real-world patient-level effectiveness. These include implementation (i.e. time and effort for clinicians to enter patient data into a phone or web-based calculator), therapy changing sensitivity to highly variable inputs (e.g single time point blood pressure), paradoxical risk estimation for some patient subgroups that are an artifact of linear modeling (e.g. women smokers), blunt treatment of race (i.e. separately derived equations for black patients), and poor calibration for modern cohorts (i.e. resulting in the overestimation of risk). This project will attempt to address these shortcomings. First, portable tools for analyzing electronic health records found within the Rhode Island Health Information Exchange (HIE) will be developed for the extraction of PCE risk factors to enable the automated calculation of ASCVD risk. PCE risk factor extraction permutations (e.g. last vs mean blood pressure) will be optimized and the equations will be calibrated for the population. Next, EHR-system agnostic tools for extracting additional risk factors available within the medical record including symptom development, social determinants of health, and family history will be developed. PCE and non-PCE risk factors will be used for artificial neural network and dynamic Bayesian network modeling of ASCVD risk phenotype clusters to augment PCE risk prediction. Finally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data derived ASCVD genetic risk score will be integrated with the HIE derived risk factors to demonstrate the potential clinical implications of implementing an omics-integrated learning healthcare system. The project will serve as foundational training for the principal investigator towards pursuing a career as a physician-scientist in the field of biomedical informatics. Hypothesis: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk estimation is central to current lipid-lowering therapy guidelines. This project will test the hypothesis that population-level data-driven methods will improve the accuracy of risk calculators. Aim 1: Determine the Predictive Performance of PCE Risk Factors Derived from Longitudinal HIE Data Aim 2: Define Population-Based ASCVD Risk Phenotype Clusters Aim 3: Demonstrate HIE-Omics-Integrated Learning Healthcare System with Direct-to-Consumer Sequencing NARRATIVE Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death and the most significant contributor to disability-adjusted life years in the United States. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the primary mechanism for the development of CVD and ten-year risk estimation is the foundation of current lipid-lowering therapy guidelines. The success of this project will improve the prediction of ASCVD and serve as a model for health information exchange derived risk estimation and population-guided preventative therapy recommendation.",Improving the Accuracy of ASCVD Risk Estimation Using Population-Level EHR and Genetic Data,10225340,F30LM013320,"['Address', 'Age', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Blood Pressure', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equation', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Maps', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'SNP genotyping', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoker', 'Smoking Status', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'data repository', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'genomic data', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mathematical sciences', 'mortality', 'open source', 'patient subsets', 'polygenic risk score', 'population based', 'portability', 'recruit', 'risk prediction', 'social health determinants', 'success', 'tool']",NLM,BROWN UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,53536
"Developing Computational Methods for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistant Agents PROJECT ABSTRACT  Antimicrobial resistance is a critical public health issue. Infections with drug resistant pathogens are estimated to cause an additional eight million hospitalization days annually over the hospitalizations that would be seen for infections with susceptible agents. The use of antibiotics (in both clinical and agricultural settings) is being viewed as precursor for these infections and thus, is a major public health concern—particularly as outbreaks become more frequent and severe. However, scientiﬁc evidence describing the hazards associated with antibiotic use is lacking due to inability to quantify the risk of these practices. One promising avenue to elucidate this risk is to use shotgun metagenomics to identify the AMR genes in samples taken through systematic spatiotemporal surveillance. The goal of this proposed work is to develop algorithms that will provide such a means for analysis. The algorithms need to be scalable to very large datasets and thus, will require the development and use succinct data structures.  In order to achieve this goal, the investigative team will develop the theoretical foundations and applied meth- ods needed to study AMR through the use of shotgun metagenomics. A major focus of the proposed work is developing algorithms that can handle very large datasets. To achieve this scalability, we will create novel means to create, compress, reconstruct and update very large de Bruijn graphs that metagenomics data in a manner needed to study AMR. In addition, we will pioneer the study of AMR through long read data by proposing new algorithmic problems and solutions that use data. For example, identifying the location of speciﬁc genes in a metagenomics sample using long read data has not been proposed or studied. Thus, the algorithmic ideas and techniques developed in this project will not only advance the study of AMR, but contribute to the growing domain of big data analysis and pan-genomics.  Lastly, we plan to apply our methods to samples collected from both agricultural and clinical settings in Florida. Analysis of preliminary and new data will allow us to conclude about (1) the public risk associated with antimicro- bial use in agriculture; (2) the effectiveness of interventions used to reduce resistant bacteria, and lastly, (3) the factors that allow resistant bacteria to grow, thrive and evolve. A–1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Antibiotic use in agriculture is a major public health concern that is receiving a lot of media attention, par- ticularly as antibiotic-resistant infections in become more frequent and severe. This research will build a novel bioinformatics framework for determining how antimicrobial resistant genes evolve, grow, and persist in a system that has been affected by antibiotic use. This will, in turn, facilitate the development of effective intervention methods that reduce resistant pathogens in clinical and agricultural settings.

"Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Early Risk of Maternal CVD: Influence of the External Exposome PROJECT SUMMARY Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are the most common pregnancy complication and are associated with an increased long-term risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) which is also the leading cause of death for women in the US. Emerging evidence suggests that environmental exposure during pregnancy may play an important role in the development of HDP. However, several limitations exist, including 1) the ignorance of residential mobility during pregnancy in exposure assessments, 2) the lack of studies considering different subtype, onset, and severity of HDP, and 3) the lack of considerations of the totality of environment (i.e. the exposome). While HDP have been linked to long-term CVD risk after pregnancy, limited data are available on early maternal CVD risk (within the first five years after delivery) complicated by HDP. More importantly, no study has focused on the impact of environmental exposures during and after pregnancy on maternal CVD risk after pregnancy. In addition, risk assessment models of HDP predominantly rely on biomarkers that are not ubiquitously tested among all pregnant women, and no predictive model has been developed to identify women at higher CVD risk after pregnancy. This study builds on our prior work in the external exposome and leverages our access to the unique statewide linked electronic health records-birth records data from the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium to address multiple challenges in the field by: 1) determining the association between pregnancy external exposome and risk of HDP, considering the subtype, onset, and severity of HDP and accounting for pregnancy residential mobility in exposure measurements; 2) assessing early risk of maternal CVD after pregnancy associated with HDP and the external exposome, and 3) developing predictive models of HDP and early risk of maternal CVD after pregnancy. This research project will be embedded in a comprehensive training program consisting of coursework, guided experiential and clinical learning, seminars, and mentorship by an established team of experts. The training program is designed to further my strengths and to develop new research skills while contributing to our scientific understanding of environmental impacts on cardiovascular health among pregnant and postpartum women. The training proposal details a five-year plan of formal and informal instruction in cardiovascular health, omics and exposome research, biomedical informatics and data science, and professional skills. My short-term career goals include completing coursework in all training areas, disseminating study findings through publications and presentations, engaging in career development activities, and applying for independent R01 funding in the third year of the award. My long-term career goal is to become an independent, collaborative, and productive epidemiologist and health data scientist leading research programs in cardiovascular health, with a focus on its intersection with perinatal and environmental epidemiology using big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a major cause of maternal and infant morbidity and mortality, and emerging evidence suggests that environmental exposure during pregnancy may play an important role in the development of HDP and subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD) after pregnancy. However, multiple challenges and knowledge gaps exist in previous studies such as the lack of studies considering different subtype, onset, and severity of HDP, the lack of considerations of the totality of environment (i.e. the exposome), and limited understandings on how environmental exposures during pregnancy may impact subsequent maternal CVD risk after delivery. Leveraging the unique statewide linked electronic health records-birth records data from OneFlorida, this study builds on our prior work in the external exposome, aiming to examine the associations between the external exposome and risk of HDP and early risk of maternal CVD after pregnancy as well as to develop predictive models of HDP and maternal CVD after pregnancy to guide precision preventions.",Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Early Risk of Maternal CVD: Influence of the External Exposome,10214088,K01HL153797,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Records', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Eclampsia', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Five-Year Plans', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'High Risk Woman', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Perinatal Epidemiology', 'Play', 'Postpartum Period', 'Postpartum Women', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevention', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residential Mobility', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Vital Statistics', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'career', 'career development', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital repositories', 'experience', 'fetal', 'health data', 'hypertensive factor', 'individualized prevention', 'infant morbidity/mortality', 'informal learning', 'insight', 'maternal morbidity', 'maternal risk', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'programs', 'science teacher', 'skills', 'sociodemographics']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2021,167207
"12/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently.

"Improving precision in modeling childhood executive function trajectories using psychometrics Project Summary: Executive functions are high-level supervisory cognitive skills vital for a child’s social and academic success. Their core components include working memory, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility. The development of executive functions in children can be adversely affected by many early life risk factors, such as lead exposure and low socioeconomic status. However, there are two difficulties to precisely measuring and modeling executive functions, which hamper our understanding of how risk factors can predict shifts in executive functioning: 1) It is common to use a single child performance task to tap into an executive function component. While this can yield important information, it can also lead to bias, because executive functions can be difficult to measure precisely, since they are interdependent and also rely on non-executive function skills. 2) It can be challenging to model the longitudinal development of executive functions because the set of tasks used to assess executive functions can change as a child grows. Some tasks may be specific to a particular age range and not appropriate for other ages. To address the first difficulty, we will improve the precision of measuring an executive function component by using well-established latent variable approaches which integrate output from multiple tasks. Preliminary analyses demonstrate that this approach can yield improved interpretability of a risk factor’s impact on an executive function component, compared to separate analyses of each task. To address the second difficulty, we propose to use advanced psychometric and item response theory methods to create a longitudinal scale of executive functioning with optimized precision and construct validity that span all the ages of interest. This will allow us to identify how risk factors can predict changes in executive function over time (e.g. developmental trajectory). This proposal leverages data from two large, NIH-funded prospective birth cohorts with extensive longitudinal data and repeated assessments of many executive function tasks, and detailed measures of risk factors (e.g. lead exposure, low socioeconomic status). Open-source, user-friendly software for the developed approaches will be developed, including a web application for non-statistical users. I (Dr. Shelley Liu) am a biostatistician and an Assistant Professor in Population Health Science and Policy at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS). ISMMS provides an excellent environment for this K25; all mentors and advisory committee members are based at ISMMS. My training will involve 1) formal graduate level coursework on executive function development, child neuropsychology, item response theory and psychometric scaling; 2) tutorials in neurodevelopment and psychometrics with my mentoring team; and 3) clinical rotations to observe neurobehavioral assessments. This training will complement my existing expertise in biostatistics. I aim to become an independent, R01-funded researcher studying child neurodevelopment and associated risk factors. Project narrative Ensuring healthy neurodevelopment for children can lead to tremendous societal gain. We propose a modeling framework that can improve our understanding of how early life factors impact neurodevelopment, which could inform targeted prevention and intervention strategies.",Improving precision in modeling childhood executive function trajectories using psychometrics,10191889,K25HD104918,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Boston', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Committee Members', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Factor Analysis', 'Factor V', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Individual', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Life course epidemiology', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York City', 'Output', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Science Policy', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive skill', 'cohort', 'environmental stressor', 'executive function', 'fetal lead exposure', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'lead exposure', 'low socioeconomic status', 'maternal stress', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'nutrition', 'open source', 'population health', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social stressor', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'web app']",NICHD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K25,2021,130561

DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently.

"19/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study-Clinical Center Abnormal regulation of glycemia (“dysglycemia”) has a very long time course, from the earliest stage of pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) has explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention in the DPP cohort, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and has examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection.

The risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those with HbA1c ≥6.5%.  During the one-year extension of DPPOS Phase 3, we will maintain and continue to follow the well-characterized and valuable DPPOS cohort, and collect measurements of outcomes as described in the protocol. We will 1) perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long-term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, and common chronic conditions of aging, and 2) explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements, and determine if alternative methods can be implemented to improve retention and adherence and to expand data collection. These aims will provide important insights into prediabetes and diabetes and their long-term outcomes and could serve the potential further study of the DPPOS cohort. The DPPOS cohort is broadly representative of the current population with pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which affect >110,000,000 individuals in the U.S. with the total cost of diabetes currently estimated at $327 billion, and provides 24 years of information on their course and complications. Understanding the effects of preventing or delaying T2D on human disease, the potential long-term benefits of lifestyle intervention and metformin, one of the most commonly used medications in the world, and the clinical course of pre-diabetes and T2D is critical if we are to apply prevention and treatment methods effectively and efficiently. We will perform new analyses to characterize the heterogeneous course of dysglycemia and its long- term complications and factors that define susceptibility or resistance to diabetes, its complications, common chronic conditions of aging, and explore the factors associated with participant retention, adherence to the protocol and completion of measurements.",15/22 Limited Competition for the Continuation of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) - Clinical Center,10154491,U01DK048387,"['Adherence', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consent', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Medicare', 'Metformin', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Mind', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical center', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'cognitive disability', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data access', 'diabetes prevention program', 'economic implication', 'follow-up', 'health economics', 'high risk population', 'human disease', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'lifestyle intervention', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'participant retention', 'phase 3 study', 'physically handicapped', 'preference', 'prevent', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'treatment group']",NIDDK,MEDSTAR HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2021,20000
"Myocardial Radiomics and Mechanics in the Pathology and Prognosis of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Though knowledge advances have been made in identification and treatment of risk factors, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the U.S., and has been worldwide for the past 15 years. The mechanisms of three leading sources of CVD morbidity, ischemic coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, appear rooted in myocardial pathophysiology of the left ventricle (LV), suggesting that deeper phenotyping of the LV may provide insight into the diseases. The detection of earliest forms of LV dysfunction has been challenging: traditional measures of LV structure and function associated with poor outcomes, such as mass and ejection fraction, reflect advanced stages of disease. However, recent advances in quantitative imaging of the LV myocardium using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) images may bridge this gap. Myocardial texture analysis is a type of ‘radiomics’, the computation of myocardial pixel intensity and patterns, which has shown the ability to differentiate pathological patterns in LV hypertrophy. Additionally, analysis of myocardial mechanics including strain and torsion have shown prognostic value in evaluation of cardiomyopathies. Thus, increasing evidence indicates roles for these technological advances in imaging analysis to evaluate pathological LV remodeling in subclinical cardiovascular disease in the general population. We hypothesize that application of these novel imaging analytics, correlated with biology, subclinical disease phenotyping, and outcomes, will enable more granular insight into subclinical LV structural and functional changes predating overt CVD and its forms. The Framingham and Jackson Heart Studies, community-based cohorts of whites and African Americans with longitudinal follow up, offer the opportunity to gain insight in CVD development through integration of advanced secondary imaging analysis with detailed and broad phenotyping and genotyping, and clinical end-points. Thus, the objectives of our proposal are threefold: 1) to first identify myocardial texture analysis and mechanics patterns associated with prevalent CVD and risk factors, 2) to define the biological and genetic underpinnings of these phenotypes, and 3) to understand their inter-association between structure and function, and their joint relations with long-term prognosis. Execution of our Aims will elucidate novel patterns, determinants, and prognosis of underlying early and progressive myocardial remodeling and dysfunction in CVD in a large bi-racial cohort. Ultimately, our goal is for knowledge gained from this study to advance phenotyping of LV remodeling groups, methods of cardiovascular risk stratification, and development of therapies for patient care. NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality in the U.S., but its multi-factorial mechanisms and early detection are not well established. Applying new analyses of cardiovascular magnetic resonance images and integrating these measures with broad existing data including risk factors, genetics, and blood biomarkers, we will obtain deeper understanding of structure and function of the heart in older aged white and African American adults. Ultimately, accomplishment of this project will facilitate new strategies towards cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment.",Myocardial Radiomics and Mechanics in the Pathology and Prognosis of Cardiovascular Disease,10099409,R01HL155717,"['Adult', 'African American', 'Aging', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemosensitization', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'EFRAC', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Myocardium', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Race', 'Radiogenomics', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Texture', 'Torsion', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'Woman', 'advanced disease', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'caucasian American', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'heart function', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'ischemic cardiomyopathy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'polygenic risk score', 'preservation', 'prognostic value', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'risk stratification', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'treatment risk', 'trend', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,639525
"Patient-Generated Health Data to Predict Childhood Cancer Survivorship Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  There are approximately 500,000 childhood cancer survivors in the U.S. today. Childhood cancer survivors are vulnerable to late effects of therapy including chronic health conditions and premature death. Predicting survivor-specific risk of late effects, discussing how to manage these risks, and offering early preventions and interventions are critical components of survivorship care. Over 75% of childhood cancer survivors have prevalent symptoms, and constantly poor or worsening symptoms are associated with onset of medical late effects. However, regular symptom monitoring is uncommon in survivorship or primary care. The core concept of this R01 grant proposal is to enable regular monitoring of patient-generated health data (PGHD), including symptoms, physical activity, energy expenditure, sleep behavior and heart rate variability, and utilize these data in predicting survivor-specific risk of late effects to improve survivorship care and outcomes.  The proposed application will enroll 620 adult survivors of childhood cancer from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study who are ≥5 years post diagnosis and currently ≥18 years of age at enrollment to achieve the following 3 specific aims: Aim 1) use a mobile health platform to collect dynamic PGHD data over 3 months and use them to develop and validate risk prediction models for future quality-of-life (QOL); Aim 2) develop/validate risk prediction models and establish personalized risk prediction scores for other outcomes (unplanned care utilization, physical performance deficits, onset of chronic health conditions) using the same approach as Aim 1; and Aim 3) create a web-based tool to calculate and report personalized outcome-specific risks, and facilitate integration of risk scores into the survivor’s patient portal and hospital’s Electronic Health Record (EHR).  We have a series of preliminary data to support this R01 grant proposal: a) in a pilot study assessing 20 common symptoms with a mobile health platform, childhood cancer survivors completed 90% of all required evaluations over 3 months; and b) in a prediction analysis from ongoing cohort of childhood cancer survivors, the inclusion of longitudinal symptom data generated a superior model performance in predicting future QOL (prediction measure, AUC=0.85) compared to the use of only age, sex, and childhood cancer type (AUC=0.63).  Linking through a mobile health platform, we will use a smartphone to collect symptom data, a wrist-worn accelerometer to collect momentary activity/behavioral data, and a finger sensor to collect heart rate variability data. We will predict patient-reported outcomes (poor QOL, unplanned healthcare utilization) and clinically- assessed outcomes (physical performance deficits, onset of chronic health conditions) on the 12th and 24th months after collecting risk factors. We will apply state-of-the-art machine/statistical learning techniques to capture features of dynamic changes in PGHD to predict these outcomes. We will build a Central Cancer Survivorship Platform to integrate predicted risks presented with interpretable scores into a patient portal and EHR, and to inform clinicians and survivors about potential adverse-event risks for risk management/intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose to develop survivor-specific risk models to predict adverse outcomes of childhood cancer through collecting daily symptoms and other patient-generated health data (physical activity, sleep behavior, heart rate variability) using mobile health devices. We will apply machine/statistical learning methods to develop and validate risk prediction models, and use qualitative methods to receive input from clinicians and survivors for developing a user-friendly dashboard and decision support tools. Our risk prediction tool will facilitate informing individualized levels of specific adverse outcomes, and providing key information for clinicians and survivors to discuss in view of preventive interventions.",Patient-Generated Health Data to Predict Childhood Cancer Survivorship Outcomes,10178979,R01CA258193,"['18 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Applications Grants', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Survivorship', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fingers', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Late Effects', 'Link', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Saint Jude Children&apos', 's Research Hospital', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'adverse event risk', 'adverse outcome', 'associated symptom', 'behavioral health', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'care outcomes', 'care providers', 'childhood cancer survivor', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'dashboard', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'outcome prediction', 'patient portal', 'patient variability', 'personalized risk prediction', 'premature', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'sensor', 'sex', 'sleep behavior', 'sociodemographic factors', 'sociodemographics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'survivorship', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web-based tool']",NCI,ST.

"Association of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder with Cardiac Electrical Instability: A Twin Study ABSTRACT Psychological stress is a potentially major risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD), but unfortunately not studied very well. This may in part be is due to the fact that many SCDs are unwitnessed, which makes the study of SCD triggers difficult. As a possible solution to this problem, we propose to study electrocardiographic (ECG) markers of cardiac electrical instability in a cohort of 1,000 Veteran male twins who are recruited from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Dr. Shah is an Early Stage Investigator who is poised to lead this effort that follows from his previous work on arrhythmia risk due to acute mental stress (K23 HL127251). His team includes several established investigators in the field of PTSD and heart disease (Viola Vaccarino, Douglas Bremner), stress and arrhythmia (Rachel Lampert), and signal processing/mobile health technologies (Gari Clifford, Larry Jamner). Dr. Shah, over the past several years, has worked closely with the Vietnam veteran twins and is an experienced investigator with this cohort. They have generated important preliminary data that demonstrates a potential relationship between PTSD and TWA; in addition, they have demonstrated feasibility of studying Veterans continuously for one week in their currently funded study which measures PTSD, autonomic function, and sleep. Dr. Shah is also leading telehealth efforts at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center, which has provided important methodologies for the current study to recruit and enroll participants from around the United States remotely. The first aim seeks to evaluate the relationship of PTSD symptoms and cardiac electrical instability using two ECG-based markers for arrhythmia: microvolt T-wave alternans (TWA) and morphological beat variability (MVB). Both are expected to be associated with higher PTSD symptoms, suggesting an acutely increased risk of sudden cardiac death. The relationship is also hypothesized to be moderated by genetic factors: when adjusting for genetic factors by evaluating monozygotic twin pairs discordant for PTSD, the relationship is attenuated. Aim 2 examines the relationship between everyday PTSD symptoms with an ecological momentary assessment and MVB/TWA. We hypothesize that acute increases in PTSD symptoms and stress also increase cardiac electrical instability, measured by higher TWA and MVB. Finally, aim 3 explores fragmented sleep and other behavioral correlates of PTSD as possible mechanisms through which PTSD may indirectly impact SCD risk through modifiable behaviors. Our hypothesis is that sleep fragmentation and other maladaptive behaviors such as low physical activity will result higher TWA/MVB on a daily basis. Overall, Dr. Shah is a poised and well-equipped to carry out this large project with novel methods and unprecedented reach in terms of impact and  Project Narrative Psychological stress is a potentially major risk factor for sudden cardiac death and can cause cardiac electrical instability. This study aims to address the reasons behind sudden cardiac death by evaluating the relationship of cardiac electrical instability with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We will also study the way in which PTSD-related genes, sleep disturbance, and physical inactivity may also play a role in its potential relationship with cardiac electrical risk.",Association of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder with Cardiac Electrical Instability: A Twin Study,10299148,R01HL155711,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Acute Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Address', 'Age', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Attenuated', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Country', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Health Technology', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Morphology', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polysomnography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological Stress', 'Publications', 'Recurrence', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Fragmentations', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Distance', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Tachyarrhythmias', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Twin Studies', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Ventricular', 'Veterans', 'Vietnam', 'Viola', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biobehavior', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'male', 'men', 'modifiable behavior', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'poor sleep', 'prospective', 'psychological trauma', 'recruit', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'sleep behavior', 'stress related disorder', 'sudden cardiac death', 'telehealth', 'traumatic stress', 'virtual']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,741461
"eMERGE Phase IV Clinical Center at Mass General Brigham Abstract: To enable the application of PRS development and implementation, our eMERGE IV proposal from Partners HealthCare leverages a large biobank (>105,000 consented with genotype data on 40,000), clinical data in the electronic health records (EHR) for >4 million patients from the largest integrated health care provider in New England, advanced bioinformatics expertise, prior leadership in PRS development and state- of-the-art genetic analysis, established expertise in returning genomics results, and experience using information technology to transform clinical processes and assessing outcomes. We propose to build on our expertise to accomplish the specific aims: Aim 1 (Discovery): Hypothesis: Polygenic risks scores will allow us to stratify eMERGE subjects based on genetic risk for common complex traits. Using the largest available genomic data resources, we will calculate and validate new PRS for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer and major depression across diverse ancestries. We will 1) compare and benchmark the performance of existing PRS construction methods in different ancestral groups, 2) develop novel statistical methods for robust trans-ethnic PRS prediction, and integrate PRS with established clinical risk factors and family history. We will obtain PRS from our network colleagues for an additional 15-e- phenotypes (total 20) with a goal of identifying high-risk individuals, e.g., top 2% of PRS risk Aim 2 (RiskInsight Report/ELSI): We will develop a “Risk Insight Report” with clinical risk factors, family history, and PRS with evidence-based recommendations for high risk participants (top 2% of phenotype specific PRS distribution) for electronic clinical implementation. We will assess risk communication formats in our ELSI Sub-Aim 1: To test the impact and interpretability of two mock RiskInsight Reports summarizing PRS as either (a) dichotomous (defining the patient as high-risk vs intermediate/low risk) or (b) quantitative (providing a numerical estimate of the percentile of risk for the patient), with linked clinical recommendations in both cases. We will then assess, through surveys of diverse HCPs and patients, the extent to which the mock reports are understood by both HCPs and patients. Aim 3 (Outcomes): Hypothesis: Physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based on eCDS of RiskInsight Reports. Among HCPs for high-risk subjects, we will see at least one change in clinical care after disclosure discussions with subjects. We will recruit 2500 participants for implementation of clinical PRS in RiskInsight Reports using a SMART on FHIR app for eCDS integrated with the EHR. The primary outcome will be whether any HCP took any action within 12 months after receipt of e-CDS defined by ordering screening tests, prescribing a preventive medication, or providing lifestyle advice. We will conduct analyses of the effect of disclosing results to high risk participants to determine how personalized results changed patient outcomes in laboratory values, risk reduction behaviors, or health care utilization. PROJECT NARRATIVE The discovery and clinical use of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for complex traits promises to dramatically change the practice of medicine. Our eMERGE IV grant will leverage a large Biobank and a rich electronic medical record to define the clinical impact of PRS derived from diverse populations and the clinical impact of returning these results along with family history and clinical risk information to participants and their healthcare providers.",eMERGE Phase IV Clinical Center at Mass General Brigham,10207715,U01HG008685,"['Algorithms', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Asians', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Family', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Japan', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction Behavior', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'clinical risk', 'data resource', 'design', 'economic outcome', 'ethical legal social implication', 'evidence based guidelines', 'exome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'polygenic risk score', 'portability', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychiatric genomics', 'recruit', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'support tools', 'trait']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2021,1415570
"Machine Learning to Reduce Hypertension Treatment Clinical Inertia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hypertension (HTN) is a main risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It can be managed through use of antihypertensive medications and lifestyle modification (i.e., diet and exercise). Adults who have controlled BP have close to a 50% decreased risk of CVD-related mortality compared to those with uncontrolled BP. However, using current guidelines, over 40% of the 100 million US adults with HTN have controlled BP. Thus, uncontrolled BP remains a significant and largely unchecked public health issue in the United States. Interventions to improve BP control exist (i.e., medication adherence and diet and exercise), but they are mostly complex and resource intensive. If resources to improve HTN control are to be efficiently used, identifying patients who are likely to have persistently uncontrolled BP may provide an opportunity for targeted and tailored intervention and close monitoring. Application of a machine learning algorithm (MLA) to electronic medical record (EMR) data could identify patients likely to have uncontrolled BP. The use and amount of data in EMRs continues to expand and improve in quality. The Temple Health EMR contains extensive demographic, clinical, prescribing, and dispensing data. MLAs are ideally suited to harness this complex and abundant data. MLAs recognize patterns in data that may be difficult to detect by researchers and identify variables that are important for prediction of an outcome. They have been used to predict hospital length of stay, hospital mortality rates, and even detect diabetic retinopathy. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest MLA to predict risk of uncontrolled BP among adults with HTN. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled BP into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients. Third, Compare clinical management of hypertension with and without a prototype of an MLA-CDS tool through a case-vignette study. These aims align with my career goal of lowering CVD risk in adults. I will accomplish these aims with the help of an accomplished mentoring team focused on hypertension and antihypertensive medication adherence, machine learning, and qualitative interviewing and CDS-tool development. During the timeframe of this study I will gain experience in (1) MLA development and validation, (2) qualitative interviewing skills to develop CDS tools for clinicians, and (3) leadership skills for principal investigators. These skills will allow me to become an independent investigator focused on identifying people at high risk for chronic disease related to CVD events and developing tools to assist physicians in lowering CVD risk at the population level. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest machine learning algorithm (MLA) to predict risk of uncontrolled blood pressure among adults with hypertension. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled blood pressure into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients.

"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this field typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind  admission risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modifiable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital  admissions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classification models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to significantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close  mentoring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a  supportive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identification and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,10134412,K23HL141639,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical center', 'clinical encounter', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'end of life', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'social', 'statistical learning', 'structured data', 'supportive environment', 'trend', 'trial design', 'unstructured data']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2021,173801
"Using Machine Learning to Improve Readmission Prediction in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Project Summary/Abstract By 2060, approximately 14 million adults are expected to live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). Although ADRD patients represent 10% of the general geriatric population, they account for 37% of the direct healthcare expenditures. Compared to other older adults, ADRD patients are at a significantly higher risk of hospitalization and unplanned 30-day hospital readmission (hereafter “readmission”). Readmissions are costly and expose ADRD patients to expedited cognitive decline, premature institutionalization, and death. Availability of a caregiver after hospital discharge is critical for ADRD patients to ensure adherence to diet, medications, and follow-up appointments. There is a paucity of evidence examining readmission among the ADRD population. Most risk-assessment tools (e.g. LACE Index) have poor discrimination power and lack inclusion of influential medical and social features, and caregiver availability particular to ADRD patients. A potential solution is to develop a risk tool using hospitals’ electronic health records (EHRs) because they contain salient clinical and sociodemographic features as well as a wealth of information from physicians’, nurses’ and social workers’ notes (unstructured EHRs data). The specific research aims for this proposal are to (1) develop and validate a risk-assessment tool for predicting readmission among ADRD patients; (2) examine the feasibility/acceptability and clinical/economic utility of the readmission risk- assessment tool; and (3) develop a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to extract information on caregiver availability from unstructured EHRs (exploratory). We hypothesize that the predictive power of our risk tool will be at least 20% higher than that of LACE Index (the current risk tool used in the Michigan Medicine hospitals). To accomplish this project, my mentors and I have defined a set of targeted career goals and educational training. My training aims include (1) gain familiarity with the clinical aspects of ADRD (linked with Research Aim 1); (2) acquire methodological skills in machine learning and predictive modeling (linked with Research Aim 1); (3) develop an understanding of the logistics of the ADRD patient discharge and care transition processes (linked with Research Aim 2); and (4) gain proficiency in NLP and algorithm validation (linked with Research Aim 3). By completion of this award, I will have used EHRs and data science to develop a validated risk-assessment tool for readmission for hospitalized ADRD patients. The results will enable efficient and targeted discharge planning to reduce readmission and wasteful spending. It will also provide pilot data needed to apply for an R01 examining the optimization of discharge process/location for hospitalized ADRD patients. This career development award will lay the foundation for me to become a unique health economist specialized in efficient care transitions for ADRD patients. Narrative Patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) are at higher risk of hospitalization and 30-day readmission (readmission) compared to other older adults. Readmission is expensive and increases the risk of institutionalization and premature death among ADRD patients.

"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,10063011,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'feature extraction', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'multiple data types', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,794994
"Digital Phenotyping of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease 1  2 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  3  4 One of the most critical gaps in management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the lack of effective  5 methods of early identification in the population. The objective of this study is to leverage data and analytics to  6 improve healthcare outcomes by early detection and risk stratification of NAFLD, before onset of liver-related  7 complications. Artificial intelligence applications in large electronic health records have the potential to identify  8 disease traits before onset of disease. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that targeted screening with  9 machine-learning models applied to large integrated healthcare datasets can identify individuals with NAFLD 10 and, more specifically, those with a progressive phenotype. We will test the central hypothesis in 2 specific 11 AIMs. First, we will train a machine learning model of NAFLD prediction using multiple longitudinal data points 12 of all health-care encounters of a well-characterized population-based cohort of individuals diagnosed with 13 NAFLD in reference to individuals without NAFLD from the general population. We hypothesize that 14 unsupervised machine learning can identify complex processes and patterns without a human's guidance and 15 discover early comorbidity clusters (“latent traits” present prior to NAFLD development) that reflect a phenotype 16 at risk to develop NAFLD later in life. Second, we will test and optimize the model for the prediction of patient 17 outcomes (development of cirrhosis, liver-related complications and death) in the NAFLD cohort. We 18 hypothesize that machine learning approaches could be used to further stratify patients into subgroups with 19 different disease trajectories, with the goal of identifying those individuals at risk of progressive NAFLD and 20 liver-related outcomes. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it expands the 21 analytical toolbox beyond conventional methods to identify individuals with NAFLD using all health-encounters 22 of a large, well-characterized population-based cohort with long follow-up. This proposal is significant because 23 it addresses a critical need of identification and management of the most prevalent chronic liver disease and 24 offers a practical solution to large scale implementation of screening and risk-stratification strategies using 25 routinely collected data. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve the population health in obesity- 26 associated diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will use innovative statistical methodology to improve the understanding of factors that predict an individual’s risk to develop nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and liver-related complications using routinely collected data available during the health care course of an individual. The development of effective and accessible tools to predict the risk of future development of liver disease will enable timely intervention to prevent the disease and reduce the burden of illness and mortality associated with obesity. Hence, the proposed research is critically important and relevant to the public health in a disease which affects a quarter of the adult population in the United States.",Digital Phenotyping of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,10188162,R03DK128127,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Cirrhosis', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Decision Modeling', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'care outcomes', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'digital', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'liver development', 'liver transplantation', 'mortality', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'population based', 'population health', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait', 'unsupervised learning']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R03,2021,119250
"Development of End-To-End Clinical Decision Support Tools To Prevent Cardiotoxic Drug Response SUMMARY Drug-induced cardiac toxicity, in the form of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, is an uncommon but devastating side effect of over one hundred currently marketed drugs. The ubiquity of drug-induced QT prolongation (diLQTS) across medical specialties and conditions creates a challenge for providers seeking to prescribe known QT-prolonging medications, particularly for non-cardiac conditions. Work by our group to develop automated clinical decision support (CDS) tools that alert providers of patient risk has shown promise towards reducing the number of prescriptions to at-risk individuals. However, these tools rely on a history of an electrocardiogram (ECG) with QT prolongation to identify at-risk patients, and thus exclude a large number of potentially at-risk individuals who have not had an ECG within our system. Through a unique institutional partnership with Google, in which a copy of our entire electronic health record (EHR) is stored on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), we have developed preliminary deep-learning models to predict risk of diLQTS. We have also validated the genetic association with the QT interval and diLQTS across several real-world populations using an aggregate polygenic risk score. Through creation of an institutional biobank with certification for clinical application of results, as well as cloud-based integration of EHR data with genetic data, we have the capability to leverage our existing infrastructure to study the role of deep learning and genetics to reduce the risk of diLQTS. This investigation will combine our unique research and clinical infrastructure on the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus with our investigative team composed of experts in the study of pharmacogenomics and medical informatics to develop and study an end-to-end CDS tool incorporating genetics and deep learning to predict risk of diLQTS. The specific aims of this application include the following: (1) develop and test a cloud-based, deep-learning model using EHR data on in- and outpatients to predict risk of diLQTS; (2) validate genetic predictors of diLQTS using institutional biobank samples, and a multi-ethnic external population; and (3) develop and test CDS tools using these advanced methods to reduce the risk of diLQTS. We will use a common data model (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) mapped from EHR data, as well as a custom DNA array (Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array) designed for imputation across a variety of non-European ancestries, to ensure that the our prediction model and findings from this study can be replicated in other institutions and populations in the future. In such a way, this investigation will not only provide insight into the use of machine learning and genetics for risk prediction of diLQTS, but it will also create a blueprint for future advanced CDS development for other conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is the development of a clinical decision support tool that can be used to predict the risk of drug-induced QT prolongation based on deep learning and genetics. This tool could be used to prevent potentially fatal side effects of medications when alternatives are available, or increase vigilance when safer alternatives are not available.

"Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with over 30,000 new HPV-related-cancers are diagnosed annually. Although HPV vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2006 and recommended for routine vaccination for school-age girls and boys, vaccination rates remain low. One reason that has contributed to low vaccination rates is incorrect “risk perceptions” around HPV vaccines such as the high perceived risks of adverse events or side effects from the HPV vaccine. Incorrect risk perceptions are often rooted in the false information about HPV vaccines that people are exposed to in their daily life, including social media. The impact of social media on health information is substantial. Negative social-media HPV-vaccine information has been found to have an association with low vaccination coverage. Given the negative consequences of false information, there is a need to develop a robust and scalable way to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it propagates and negatively impacts behavior. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to build a model to identify false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter, demonstrate its impact on individual risk perceptions and measure its underlying mechanisms on risk perception formation. We propose a novel approach to leverage machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis, crowdsourcing/expert data annotation, psycholinguistic analysis and statistical modeling to investigate the false HPV-vaccine information collectively (in terms of its detection and propagation patterns) and individually (in terms of its impact and underlying cognitive mechanisms). Our study will first build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter. By modeling the domain-specific HPV- vaccine related text content, information-veracity related linguistic features, individual and collective user behaviors, and dissemination patterns, our model will be able to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it gets verified and spreads widely. We will then investigate the impact of false HPV-vaccine information on risk perceptions around HPV vaccination operationalized by natural language processing methods and a developed HPV-vaccine Risk Lexicon. We will further conduct psycholinguistic analysis on the false HPV-vaccine information and use statistical modeling to uncover the underlying mechanism of risk perceptions. Our study will make a critical and timely contribution to identifying the false HPV-vaccine information and its impact, which has the potential to be applied to other health topics. This proposed project will also address the National Cancer Institute priorities in promoting HPV vaccines and combating misinformation in cancer prevention and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE The uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in part because of incorrect perceptions of vaccination risks, which has been linked to the spread of false HPV-vaccine information. The proposed study seeks to build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on social media (Twitter) and determine its impact on risk perceptions of the HPV vaccine. The findings will provide important contributions to understand the impact of false health information on HPV vaccination behavior and could be expanded to other health topics.",Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions,10114245,R21CA237483,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine', 'Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Individual', 'Information Dissemination', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plant Roots', 'Politics', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'School-Age Population', 'Semantics', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Text', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'adverse event risk', 'boys', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer prevention', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'girls', 'high risk', 'information model', 'information processing', 'multilevel analysis', 'news', 'novel strategies', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'risk perception', 'side effect', 'social media', 'theories', 'uptake', 'vaccine acceptance']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2021,174255
"Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse PROJECT SUMMARY Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common valvulopathy affecting over 170 million worldwide. Every year, 0.4- 1.9% of individuals with MVP will develop sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD), and 7% of SCDs in the young are caused by MVP. However, predictors of this devastating outcome are not readily available, and indications for a primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in MVP are lacking. Severe mitral regurgitation explains only 50% of SCA cases in MVP. SCD/SCA risk has also been linked to a bileaflet phenotype with mild MR, mitral annular disjunction (MAD), and left ventricular focal fibrosis on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images. Such imaging parameters (including LGE) have not been evaluated prospectively. Moreover, they are not consistently found in SCA survivors, and diffuse fibrosis has been proposed as an alternative arrhythmic substrate by our group and others based on CMR/T1 mapping, strain echocardiography, and post-mortem data. Overall, it is challenging to pinpoint a unique imaging phenotype, and uncertainty exists about which MVP patients should undergo CMR. Regardless of arrhythmic phenotype, complex ventricular ectopy (ComVE - defined as frequent polymorphic PVCs, bigeminy or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) is detected in 80-100% of MVP cases prior to SCA or SCD. ComVE, commonly associated with left ventricular fibrosis on CMR, is linked to higher all-cause mortality and SCA rates (20% versus 12% if no ComVE, p < 0.05) based on preliminary cross-sectional data. Our central hypothesis is that MVP patients with ComVE, because of the higher prevalence of either LGE or abnormal T1 mapping, represent ideal CMR candidates regardless of leaflet involvement or MAD, and can be rapidly identified by an automated “surveillance” tool within a large echocardiographic database. Moreover, we hypothesize that fibrosis is the strongest predictor of SCD/SCA in an unprecedented, multi-center effort to longitudinally assess clinical and CMR parameters of arrhythmic risk in MVP. Specifically, we aim to 1) Assess the role of CMR as a screening tool for fibrosis in MVP with ComVE incorporating T1 mapping in addition to LGE in an unselected MVP sample; 2) Develop an echo-based machine-learning algorithm to detect MVP with ComVE, test its association with myocardial fibrosis on CMR and longitudinal SCD/SCA risk; and 3) Build a novel prospective SCD/SCA risk prediction model in MVP. Better selection of CMR candidates and development of a SCD/SCA risk prediction tool inclusive of fibrosis by CMR are expected to dramatically improve risk stratification in MVP and establish future criteria for primary prevention ICD trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Every year, 0.4-1.9% of individuals with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) will develop sudden cardiac death or arrest. In this application we propose to better identify those at risk by using cardiac magnetic resonance and echocardiography-based artificial intelligence, with the long-term goal of selecting those that may benefit most from a defibrillator. .",Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse,10171903,R01HL153447,"['Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Echocardiography', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Heart Arrest', 'High Prevalence', 'Holter Electrocardiography', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mission', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Mitral Valve Prolapse', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Prevention', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Screening procedure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'prognostic significance', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'secondary analysis', 'stem', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,779765
"Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction Project Summary Early disease prevention, detection, and intervention are fundamental goals for advancing human health. Meanwhile, genetic risk is, for all intents and purposes, the earliest significant contributor to common, heritable, disease risk. Thus, in theory, genetic profiling should be the ideal tool for early disease prevention. Yet, genetic factors are rarely used directly to predict future disease risk. Rather, genetic information is typically relegated to phenotype-first scenarios: providing or confirming diagnoses for individuals with overt disease or clarifying the genetic risk for individuals with a strong family history of disease. For modern genomics to make a significant impact on disease prevention the use of genomic information must transition to a genotype-first approach; prediction of genetic disease risk in otherwise healthy individuals. A major barrier to this transition includes our limited ability to predict the precise array of risks and likely phenotypic expression of disease in an individual from genetic and other risk factors. The degree of disease risk and phenotypic expression conveyed to any single individual by genetic factors is a result of a complex interplay between direct and indirect genetic effects, other unmodifiable risk factors (age, gender, ancestry, family history), and intermediate modifiable risk factors (environment, behavior, laboratory values, health status, therapy status, etc.) many of which have their own direct genetic mediators. New approaches are required to dissect this interplay in order to personalize and contextualize preventative actions that most effectively reduce overall disease risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is the development of innovative Deep learning and machine-learning approaches to integrate baseline genetic risk predictions with the measurement of traditional risk factors in order to provide more accurate and actionable predictions of disease risk. By tying genetic risk to traditional risk factors, especially modifiable risk factors, we will enable actionability by allowing both a determination of preventative actions that may be especially effective because they offset genetic risk, as well as the identification of modifiable risk factors that should be monitored and controlled proactively given increased genetic predisposition. To accomplish this goal, we propose to develop methods to: (1) infer the likely phenotypic expressivity of monogenic risk variants via a spatial covariance machine learning approach, (2) predict prevalent disease cases and the expected value of intermediate modifiable risk factors from polygenic and other unmodifiable risk factors, and finally (3) predict prevalent disease cases through interactions between baseline genetic expectations and observed (measured) intermediate modifiable risk factors in a deep learning framework. Adjusting age and modifiable risk factors in these trained models would then allow for the interactive projection of future disease risk and the identification of modifiable risk factors that, when manipulated, lead to the greatest change in future disease risk. We focus on the development of methods for coronary artery disease given its public health importance, the known utility of polygenic risk estimation, and the current evidence for polygene-by-environment interactions. In addition, the approach we propose integrates directly with current clinical decision support tools for coronary artery disease management.

"Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) is a lethal neoplasm and a common hematologic malignancy. MM is uniformly preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Unlike MM, patients with MGUS are asymptomatic. The current management for MGUS is watchful waiting for disease progression. A marked racial disparity in this disease area is long-established with a 2 to 3-fold increased risk in African Americans (AAs) compared to Caucasians. Moreover, obesity is a risk factor for MM independent of race. Obesity is prevalent in U.S. adults, and particularly more prevalent among AAs than Caucasians. As a result, without any intervention, racial disparities in this disease will continue to worsen. Metformin, a widely-used, safe, well- tolerated, and inexpensive medication, induces weight loss and has been found to be more effective in glycemic control in AAs compared to Caucasians. It has also been used in prospective trials for non-diabetes indications and solid tumor malignancies. We therefore hypothesize that metformin use in MGUS patients will prevent MM and reduce MM disparities. This project plans to focus on the precursor condition of MM – MGUS. The findings from the proposed project will inform biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials. The long-term goal is to identify intervention strategies to prevent the progression of MGUS to MM, reduce the overall burden of MM, and reduce MM disparities. We plan to identify whether high body mass index (BMI) and/or significant change in BMI over the life course are risk factors for MGUS by race (Aim 1), utilizing linked databases with nearly lifelong follow-up of BMI and other health measures ,as well as utilizing artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning approaches, to perform big data analyses. We will then assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory after MGUS diagnosis in metformin versus non-metformin users in a subgroup of MGUS patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (Aim 2.1) and the association of metformin use with the progression of MGUS to MM (Aim 2.2). Last, we will assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory in the subgroup of MGUS patients without diabetes mellitus (Aim 3). This project is significant in its capability to 1) identify perhaps the only modifiable risk factor (high BMI) to inform interventions to prevent MM; 2) identify a dynamic marker for disease progression by race (M-protein concentration), where these biomarkers can be a surrogate for MM diagnosis in future prevention trials; and 3) reduce MM health disparities by a) identifying race-specific biomarkers for MGUS and MGUS progression, available through clinical encounters (as opposed to expensive genetic testing); and b) exploring metformin use as a chemopreventive measure. It is innovative in its 1) focus on MM prevention rather than treatment and 2) utilization of artificial intelligence to analyze big data. Successful completion of this study will provide evidence for a paradigm shift in current clinical practice of MGUS management and help prevent MM, an incurable and costly disease. More importantly, it will provide evidence to guide interventions to reduce MM disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in multiple myeloma (MM), a common and incurable malignancy whose management is extremely costly, are long-established. Although MM is preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) by many years, no established prevention strategies exist and current clinical practice does not treat patients with MGUS; thus, racial disparities for this disease are expected to persist or even worsen due to the disproportionate burden of obesity – a known risk factor for MM – in the African American population. This project plans to study racial differences in risk factors/biomarkers for MGUS and the progression of MGUS to MM to inform future biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials with the goal of reducing MM health disparities.",Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective,10271266,R01CA253475,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Caucasians', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Department of Defense', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Economic Burden', 'Event', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Agency for Research on Cancer', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metformin', 'Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Neoplasms', 'Obesity', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Race', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Subgroup', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'carcinogenicity', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'diabetic', 'follow-up', 'genetic testing', 'glycemic control', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'high body mass index', 'innovation', 'modifiable risk', 'multiple myeloma M Protein', 'obese person', 'preclinical study', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'specific biomarkers', 'working group']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,360281
"A Comprehensive Strategy to Detect Glaucoma Worsening Earlier and With Fewer Tests ABSTRACT  This is an application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award. The goal of this proposal is to provide the candidate with the advanced skills needed to establish an independent research program in the area of glaucoma diagnostic testing with special expertise in test error correction and predictive modeling of future glaucoma outcomes. To facilitate this long-term goal, in the current proposal, the candidate’s main research goal is to reduce the time and number of tests necessary to detect glaucoma worsening by (1) correcting for errors in previously obtained visual field (VF) and peripapillary optical coherence tomography (OCT) tests by using multilevel models with Bayesian analysis (MLB) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) (2) stratifying eyes at high and low risk for rapid glaucoma worsening at the baseline clinical visit using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). These aims are based on high quality preliminary data which show that: (1) the effect of VF reliability metrics and OCT signal strength on test error can be quantified and thus corrected for and (2) machine learning methods can predict risk of future VF progression with fair accuracy with baseline visit VF data alone and therefore adding structural (OCT) and clinical information from the baseline visit is likely to improve model accuracy. The main hypotheses of the proposed research aims are (1) correcting for test errors with MLB and GAN will reduce the time needed to detect worsening by 10 and 20% respectively (2) combining baseline visit structural (OCT), functional (VF) and clinical data as inputs into DCNNs will allow us to achieve an area under the receiver operating curve of at least 0.8 at predicting the risk of future rapid glaucoma worsening. The candidate proposes a comprehensive training plan, combining formal coursework, meetings, seminars and workshops overseen by his diverse group of mentors. Specific training goals include: (1) Receiving training in multi-level regression modeling and Bayesian analysis techniques. (2) Becoming adept at data science with a special emphasis on learning Python for data extraction, manipulation and analysis. (3) Furthering knowledge of machine learning techniques with a specific emphasis on deep learning including DCNNs and GANs. (4) Continuing training in the ethical and responsible conduct of research. The training plan will be executed in coordination with the set of research activities mentioned above. Results from this research proposal will be used to develop a subsequent R01 research proposal that will facilitate the candidate’s transition to an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main aim of this study is to reduce the time and number of tests needed to accurately detect worsening of glaucoma by 1) correcting visual field and optical coherence tomography tests for errors and 2) accurately predicting future disease worsening based on baseline visit clinical, functional and structural data.

"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,10063429,K25DK113242,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietitian', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Energy Intake', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Access', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'adult obesity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'computer science', 'craving', 'dietary', 'emotional eating', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'heart rate variability', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obese person', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'substance abuse treatment', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2021,165181
"Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease Project Summary  Cardiovascular disease negatively affects millions of people worldwide. Globally, it accounts for approximately thirty percent of all deaths. Furthermore, a significant fraction of deaths caused by cardiovascular disease occur in a non-geriatric population; fifteen percent of all worldwide deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease for people under the age of seventy. Treatment to prevent cardiovascular events should be based on highly individualized risk prediction. High risk patients should get more aggressive treatments because the risk of disease outweighs the burden of treatment, while low risk patients should be managed more conservatively. For example, anti-thrombotic therapy for coronary heart disease may increase bleeding risk and may not be appropriate for low-risk patients. Two primary kinds of cardiovascular disease are stroke and coronary heart disease, and there have been a number of developments in risk scores for both ailments. However, these risk scores only use a small fraction of the available measurements about a patient and treat risk as a collection of independent factors rather than considering how their interactions amplify or ameliorate risk. Moreover, a majority of the popular coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores are designed to be manually computed by a busy physician at the point of care, which further limits their scope and fidelity. Next generation risk scores for stroke and cardiovascular disease should take into account all of the available information in the electronic health record without the constraints of the parametric assumptions of traditional risk modeling. More accurate risk assessment of coronary heart disease and stroke will lead to better care and reduce the cardiovascular disease burden.  Our vision is to capitalize on large collections of electronic health records along with recent advances in deep learning to build risk scores that use more available health information while making minimal mathematical assumptions about the nature of clinical risk. Our proposal propels the field from human computable independent risks calculations necessitated by previous limitations of technology to calculations that make use of deep learning to learn highly nonlinear risks and risk factor interactions. We additionally demonstrate how deep learning can be used to deal with the ever-present issue of missing values in medicine. Our proposal also targets an area under- explored by previous work on risk scores: fairness. Treatment quality is affected by the quality of risk estimation. This means populations where estimated risk is less accurate may receive worse care. Risk scores developed with simple models may only capture risk accurately for the majority population as simple models are not flexible enough to cover multiple populations. We seek to identify potential risk calculation differences with respect to race and ethnicity. We will construct and evaluate deep learning methods for coronary heart disease and stroke risk assessment from electronic health records. We will develop techniques to incorporate clinical text, handle missing data, and evaluate fairness of deep learning for cardiovascular risk scores. Finally, we will make our work available as open source code written in deep learning frameworks, at clinical conferences, and publications. Project Narrative Coronary heart disease and stroke create a large burden of disease in the world and require accurate risk assessment to aid in providing appropriate treatments. We will construct and validate deep learning risk scores for both coronary heart disease and stroke using large quantities of information from the electronic health record and take care to evaluate potential racial and ethnic biases present in the algorithm. More accurate coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores provided by this approach have the potential to reduce the overall cardiovascular disease burden with a specific focus on minority communities.",Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease,10213130,R01HL148248,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Work', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical conference', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'ethnic bias', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'heart disease risk', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'negative affect', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'racial diversity', 'relating to nervous system', 'stroke model', 'stroke risk', 'thromboembolic stroke']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,673978
"Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment Postoperative complications and readmissions rates are higher in minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) patients. Low SES is associated with frailty, one of the best predictors of 30-day postoperative complications and early hospital readmission. Despite their influence on health outcomes, frailty and social risk factors are not considered in risk adjustment for reimbursement and quality measures. CMS developed financial incentive- based programs to improve quality of care. Yet this strategy disproportionately penalizes minority-serving, major teaching and safety net hospitals (SNH), further constraining resources for the care of vulnerable populations. Our long-term goal is to use frailty and social risk factors to identify at-risk patients to design more effective clinical care pathways. Frailty can be derived retrospectively using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) dataset. Data networks are powerful research tools that can be used to answer important questions. However, extracting data from EHR is challenging. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) developed 13 Clinical Data Research Networks (CDRN) that have considerable overlapping membership with Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) institutions. While steady progress has been made, multiple barriers exist to efficiently access and use data. We will engage 3 CTSA hubs, each members of a different CDRN, to locally merge identified datasets developing data accessing and linking strategies at diverse institutions for dissemination across sites within CDRNs and to ultimately perform similar studies across CDRNs. We will use the SMART IRB reliance platform to harmonize the regulatory approval process as much as possible for each step of this project to identify barriers to use in data networks. We propose the following Aims: 1) Determine the predictive power of ethnicity, race, SES, and frailty for postoperative complications, mortality  and readmissions to improve risk adjustment at 3 CTSA/CDRNs 2) Estimate postoperative functional status using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning  algorithms on inpatient physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and nursing notes for ACS NSQIP  patients to predict long-term functional status 3) Develop methods to predict long-term loss of independence after major surgery 4) Determine hospital resource utilization stratified by SES, frailty and minority status The significance of our study is the incorporation of social risk factors, frailty and functional status in risk adjustment forming the basis for future interventions by targeting patients at the highest risk for postoperative complications and reducing health care disparities. Our innovative approach harnesses data sources at diverse institutions with the goal of disseminating these methods across 3 CDRNs and the CTSA network. Project Narrative: Patients with social risk factors, including poverty, being a minority, lack of an education and frailty are all associated with having worse health outcomes and with more difficulties recovering after surgical procedures. Safety net hospitals take care of many people with social risk factors and are being judged on the quality of care provided without accounting for the challenges faced by poor people. We will study the effect of social risk factors and frailty on health outcomes after surgery to identify patients that would benefit from care pathways that help poor and/or frail people.","Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment",10199784,U01TR002393,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Community Surveys', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physical therapy', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Recovery of Function', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic data', 'financial incentive', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'innovation', 'low socioeconomic status', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'payment', 'postoperative recovery', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'readmission rates', 'safety net', 'simulation', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'tool', 'usability']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,U01,2021,100000
"Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics PROJECT SUMMARY Given the growing burden of antimicrobial resistance (AR) and lack of effective therapies for multi-drug resistant organisms, the development of new tools or models which risk-stratify patients for colonization and infection by AR bacteria is of paramount importance, particularly in high-risk populations. The significance of the gut microbiome in mediating colonization resistance against drug resistant pathogens as well as the role of microbiota-depleting antibiotics in the development of AR infections is being increasingly appreciated. However, there is currently a deficiency of methods integrating microbiome and antibiotic factors into AR- predictive algorithms. Thus, the overall objective of the proposed research is to improve understanding of the factors driving the epidemiology of AR-colonization and infection by incorporating metagenomic and antibiotic administration data of a well-defined clinical cohort. In this proposal, we focus on patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (from whom we have already collected extensive longitudinal stool samples and performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing) because of the high rates of AR pathogen colonization and severe risk for infection. The overarching hypothesis that will be tested is that the baseline presence of a limited number of key bacterial species and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are critical for the risk of colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen when combined with the administration of specific antimicrobials. We will begin our research by comprehensively determining the epidemiology of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection in our cohort via culture based stool sample analyses and clinical chart review, respectively. Using shotgun metagenomics, we will establish whether the baseline intestinal microbiome species and resistome characteristics are associated with the acquisition of AR pathogens colonizing or causing infection. Similarly, we will ascertain the relationship between antimicrobial exposure, microbiome disruption, and subsequent AR emergence. The data from these studies will be integrated into Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) models to improve the prediction of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection outcomes. The proposed career development award, which utilizes the expertise of a superlative mentorship team and a uniquely designed research and training plan, will enable me the opportunity to build upon my current expertise in microbiology, genomics, and molecular epidemiology by adding advanced training in shotgun metagenomic analyses, bioinformatics, and biostatistical modeling. Moreover, the numerous resources and support provided by my institution and mentoring team will ensure my successful transition to an independent investigator as well as establish a strong foundation for my long-term goals of understanding and mitigating the impact of antimicrobial resistance in human health via integration of multiple –omics platforms and provision of personalized genomic-based medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibiotic resistant (AR) infections are one of the most serious public health threats and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunocompromised patients. The proposed research will use a combination of culture-based techniques and high-throughput approaches to determine the epidemiology of colonization and infectious events by AR-pathogens, characterize the gut microbiome, and mine clinical data of acute leukemia patients receiving chemotherapy in order to identify microbial species, antibiotic resistance genes, patient features, and antibiotic administration factors that affect the risk for colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to exploit metagenomics as an epidemiological tool for understanding susceptibility to AR outcomes and to build predictive risk models which can be potentially incorporated into prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate AR infection events in high-risk patients.",Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics,10300376,K01AI143881,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shotguns', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'colonization resistance', 'commensal microbes', 'drug resistant pathogen', 'effective therapy', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'genomic epidemiology', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'leukemia', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'multiple omics', 'pathogen', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'resistance gene', 'risk stratification', 'skills', 'stool sample', 'tool']",NIAID,TEXAS A&M AGRILIFE RESEARCH,K01,2021,108000
"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning. AKI risk factors discovered from EMR of diverse populations from multiple institutions across nine US states will be reliable and robust and can assist clinicians in providing proactive and personalized care to high-risk patients.",Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning,10200790,R01DK116986,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'base', 'case-based', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'design', 'feature selection', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injury prevention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'prevent', 'risk prediction']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,506211
"Deep Learning Image Analysis Algorithms to Improve Oral Cancer Risk Assessment for Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders Abstract Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) are a group of mucosal diseases in the oral cavity with a risk of progressing to oral squamous cell carcinoma. Risk assessment is traditionally done through a combination of clinical and histologic evaluation. Leukoplakia is a common type of OPMD that is given a histologic grading score that is supposed to be related to its risk of progression. However, there is tremendous intra- and inter- observer heterogeneity in dysplasia grading, leading to variability and uncertainty in risk assessment and treatment planning. This also hinders the ability to study the biology of these lesions. We propose to use whole slide imaging on routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections in combination with deep learning methods to build a consistent risk scoring system for OPMD. Our methods will identify cell, nucleus, and tissue architectural features relevant to risk of progression in OPMD. These features will be tested in a large retrospective case-control study and then validated prospectively. We will also explore combining them with genomic and immune biomarkers in order to improve the prognostic power and explore the biolo gy of progression in OPMD. We hope that these efforts will improve and standardize risk assessment for OPMD. This could lead to improved treatment and prevention options by enabling risk stratification and allowing future clinical trials be conducted in a more uniform patient cohort. Similarly, it could improve our understanding for the biology of OPMD and the process of progression to cancer. Project Narrative Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) are a common and heterogeneous group of mucosal lesions in the oral cavity without robust and consistent biomarkers for their risk of progression to can cer. Here we propose to use whole slide imaging analysis of routine clinical samples to develop a more robust risk assessment process.

"Combining Systems Pharmacology Modeling With Machine Learning To Identify Sub-Populations At Risk Of Drug-Induced Torsades de Pointes Project Summary  Torsades de Pointes, a lethal ventricular arrhythmia, is a side effect of several commonly used antiarrhythmics, antibiotics, antipsychotics, antihistamines and other ‘non-cardiovascular’ therapies. Though this adverse event is rare, it can lead to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. The ignorance about the underlying differences between those at high risk versus low risk of forming this drug-induced arrhythmia halts any considerable progress in preventing it. Rather than simply removing these drugs from the market, a closer examination of the physiological and clinical traits of patients who benefited from the treatment and those who formed the arrhythmia needs to be performed. This highlights the idea of precision medicine and the importance of identifying relevant sub-groups of patients likely to benefit from a treatment versus those who are highly susceptible to a drug-induced adverse event. The current standards for predicting risk, a lengthened action potential (AP) duration of cells and a prolonged QT interval on an echocardiogram (ECG) have proven ineffective. Thus, there is a need to extract pertinent information from the cellular and tissue levels before administration of the therapeutic to detect patterns only apparent in the high-risk population. To analyze this concept, I plan to (1) explain at a mechanistic level the differences between the healthy and at-risk patients, (2) identify important AP and ECG signatures that can predict risk early on, and (3) connect the physiological and clinical findings to improve the profile and description of the high-risk population. I will combine two complementary computational techniques: (1) simulations with mechanistic quantitative systems pharmacology models of heart cells and tissues; and (2) advanced machine learning approaches that can identify hidden patterns. Thus, this project aims to develop an algorithm which will improve risk prediction and upgrade the current imperfect and unreliable standards for prescribing proarrhythmic therapies. Project Narrative Current standards for identifying patients at risk of forming the rare but lethal ventricular tachycardia, Drug- induced Torsades de Pointes include measuring the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Although this decently predicts susceptibility, there remains a percentage of patients who still succumb to an arrhythmia with a normal QT. To improve patient risk stratification, this research project aims to develop an algorithm that can unmask subtle precursors at both the physiological and clinical levels, classify high risk patients, and upgrade the current imperfect standards for prescribing these therapies.",Combining Systems Pharmacology Modeling With Machine Learning To Identify Sub-Populations At Risk Of Drug-Induced Torsades de Pointes,10082298,F31HL149358,"['Action Potentials', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihistamines', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Factors', 'Cardiac', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Ion Channel', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Muscle Cells', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Torsades de Pointes', 'Translating', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'complex data', 'delayed rectifier potassium channel', 'drug market', 'efficacious treatment', 'experimental study', 'heart cell', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'insight', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'responders and non-responders', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'side effect', 'simulation', 'sudden cardiac death', 'supervised learning', 'trait']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,F31,2021,44436
"Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) have well-established risk factors such as physical activity (PA), depression, and hypertension (HTN). These risk factors disproportionately affect racial minority populations, but the mechanisms underlying racial health disparities are not well understood. In this, geographic factors could be key, as PA, depression and HTN are strongly affected by geographic exposures, including green space. However, green space is typically measured with questionnaires, which have substantial error, or satellite-based indexes that are nonspecific and provide no information on the type of vegetation (e.g., tree vs. grass), nor whether the vegetation is within view at the street level. As a result, no study has quantified the contribution of green space to racial disparities in ADRD. And while novel technologies such as Google Street Views (GSV) imaging are promising data sources for capturing unique measures of green space, managing, processing, and analyzing high-dimensional data present significant logistical and analytical challenges, especially when linking these data to existing data from large prospective cohorts. Finally, we need to understand green space in the context of other potentially correlated geographic exposures, or the urban exposome—the totality of life- course geographic exposures (the set of green space, air pollutants, noise, built environment, and social environment)—to estimate which factors drive health. This proposal will address these challenges by using GSV imaging to assess the effect of green space on PA, depression, and HTN, as well as subsequent ADRD risk within the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)—a 10-year longitudinal study of 6,814 men and women without clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline from 4 racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic White, African-American, Chinese, and Hispanic). Aim 1 will quantify the effect of specific aspects of green space (e.g. trees, grass, shrubs, plants) on ADRD and cognitive decline and evaluate whether these associations differ according to race/ethnicity. Aim 2 will determine the indirect effect of green space on ADRD that is mediated through PA, depression, and HTN. Aim 3 will quantify exposome associations with ADRD and cognitive decline using untargeted data-driven approaches in conjunction with dimension reduction techniques and evaluate whether they differ according to race/ethnicity. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) implementing deep learning algorithms to analyze high-resolution geographic data, (2) cognitive function epidemiology, and (3) developing and refining data-driven approaches to perform exposome-informed epidemiological studies. These combined plans will successfully prepare the applicant for an independent research career focused on identifying modifiable geographic determinants of ADRD in diverse populations using innovative measures of geographic context. Project Narrative Green space or trees and natural vegetation can provide mental health benefits and possibly lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); however, green space is often measured poorly in epidemiologic research. I propose to integrate high-resolution images from Google Street Views to derive ground-level objective measurements of green space into a diverse prospective cohort study using deep learning algorithms, mediation analysis and geographic mixtures. This research will enable unprecedented perspectives on exposures that drive ADRD and related cognitive decline risk, and will provide translational insights into potential interventions to optimize opportunities for ADRD prevention and reduce racial disparities in ADRD.",Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment,10146274,K99AG066949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Air Pollutants', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Baltimore', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chicago', 'Chinese People', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Green space', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Los Angeles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Plants', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Social Environment', 'Social Impacts', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'built environment', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'economic impact', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'healthy aging', 'high resolution imaging', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'men', 'multidimensional data', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial disparity', 'racial health disparity', 'racial minority', 'segmentation algorithm', 'skills', 'urban public health']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2021,118800
"Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP) Abstract Placental abruption is an obstetrical complication defined as premature placental separation. Despite its elusive etiology, it is believed to be the consequence of acute stimuli – ischemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress at the maternal‐fetal interface – associated with rupture of the decidual artery, resulting in (premature) placental separation. The study of abruption and maternal and newborn long‐term cardiovascular and hemorrhagic/thrombotic cerebrovascular events is the central focus of the proposed project. We will examine the long‐term impact of abruption on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in women and in their children. We will also investigate the relationship of clinical classification (mild and severe forms) of abruption, risks based on abruption across successive pregnancies, and abruption in twin pregnancies, on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We will undertake a causal mediation analysis to evaluate the extent to which these associations may be mediated through (i) preterm delivery and (ii) small for gestational age births. We will perform this analysis by clinical classification of abruption and estimate the extent of mediation following corrections for both measured (socio‐demographic characteristics, including maternal smoking, comorbid medical conditions, and obstetrical events), and unmeasured confounding. A unique aspect of this project will be to identify, through applications of Support Vector Machines and Deep Learning algorithms, subsets of women at high risk for abruption and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. Finally, we will examine whether maternal race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status are effect measure modifiers of the association between abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We propose to address these aims through a large population‐based epidemiologic study, utilizing data from the Myocardial Infarction Data Acquisition System (MIDAS), a New Jersey statewide database of all patients admitted to all non‐federal acute care hospitals in NJ with a CVD diagnosis, with longitudinal follow‐up of up to 30 years. The MIDAS data will be linked to the NJ fetal death and linked live birth‐ infant death data with associated maternal and newborn hospitalization data between 1980‐2017 to create one of the largest and most comprehensive databases in the US to evaluate the extent to which sentinel events in pregnancy impart lasting risk for women's and children's health later in life. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, policy implications and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE) The overarching goal of this project is to examine the associations between placental abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality later in life. The project will focus on overall associations, as well as identifying subsets of women at high risk based on abruption severity, recurrent abruptions, gestational age at delivery, and fetal growth restriction. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, and policy implications regarding women's health, and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.",Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP),10238171,R01HL150065,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Birth', 'Cardiovascular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Risk Woman', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Infant Health', 'Infant Mortality', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia', 'Life', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'New Jersey', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patients', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Placenta', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rupture', 'Sentinel', 'Severities', 'Small for Gestational Age Infant', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'acute care', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'comorbidity', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning algorithm', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'health of the mother', 'high risk', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'improved', 'infant death', 'insight', 'interest', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal risk', 'mortality', 'obstetrical complication', 'policy implication', 'population based', 'premature', 'screening guidelines', 'sociodemographics', 'stillbirth', 'support vector machine', 'thrombotic']",NHLBI,RBHS-ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,686450
"Airway Tree Subtyping on Large Cohorts of CT Images for COPD Risk Project Summary / Abstract: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) defined by irreversible airflow limitation, is the 3rd leading cause of death globally and 4th in the United States. Smoking tobacco is a major extrinsic COPD risk factor, but despite six decades of declining smoking rates in many countries, the corresponding declines in COPD have been modest. Only a minority of lifetime smokers develop COPD, and up to 25% occurs in never smokers. While other factors have been linked to COPD much of the variation in COPD risk remains unexplained. In addition, personalized risk and therapies are lacking for COPD, due to a lack of reliable COPD subphenotypes. Airflow obstruction, or reduced airflow from the lungs, is determined in part by airway tree structure and lung volume, both of which can be imaged with high precision by high resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) scans. Emerging evidence by our group suggests that airway tree structure variation is common in the general population and is a major contributor to this unexplained COPD risk. By manual labeling of the airway tree structure, limited to one airway generation in just 2 of the 5 lung lobes (due to complexity of tree structure), we found that 26% of the general population has major airway branch variants that differ from the classical “textbook” structure, increase COPD risk, and have a strong and biologically plausible genetic basis. We further demonstrated that airway tree caliber variation (dysanapsis) measured on CT was a stronger predictor of COPD risk than all known risk factors including smoking. Yet there is no standardized approach to characterize the full scope airway tree variation, making the exact relationship between COPD and individual airway-structure features unclear. This proposal would apply for the first-time the power of machine learning methods to the entire airway tree structure imaged on HRCT to build logically upon prior high-impact work to discover new COPD subphenotypes for risk stratification and biological pathways of intervention. Also, we will apply sophisticated / rigorous mathematical clustering approaches to airway trees derived from over 18,000 computed tomography (CT) scans in three highly characterized NIH/NHLBI-funded cohorts – the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Lung Study, the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Study (SPIROMICS), and the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) Study, in addition to the Canadian Cohort of Obstructive Lung Disease (CanCOLD) – to discover and replicate novel and clinically significant airway tree subtypes and their genetic basis. The proposed study provides a transformative opportunity to define and validate normal and clinically relevant tree variation in the general population and COPD cohorts. This research would result in robust, reproducible, image based novel quantitative airway tree structure subtypes from lung CT scans, and understand their role in COPD risk, prognosis, and their underlying genetic basis to help personalize COPD risk. Project Narrative For Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD, the 4th cause of death in the USA) defined by irreversible airflow, there is emerging evidence that suggests that variation in airway tree structure is common in the general population and is a major contributor to unexplained COPD risk. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding airway tree structure subtypes from lung CT scans would advance our knowledge of disease susceptibility and improve personalized therapies, prognosis, and identify an underlying genetic basis to COPD risk. Thus, this proposal is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to fostering fundamental creative discoveries and innovative research strategies as a basis for ultimately protecting health.",Airway Tree Subtyping on Large Cohorts of CT Images for COPD Risk,10299153,R01HL155816,"['3-Dimensional', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Air Movements', 'Asthma', 'Biological', 'Caliber', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dictionary', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Obstructive Lung Diseases', 'Occupational', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'disorder risk', 'environmental tobacco smoke', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'high standard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lung development', 'lung lobe', 'lung volume', 'machine learning method', 'never smoker', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'pollutant', 'prognostic significance', 'pulmonary function decline', 'respiratory', 'risk stratification', 'risk variant', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2021,681411
"A Pragmatic Latent Variable Learning Approach Aligned with Clinical Practice Abstract With growing interest in personalized medicine and the rise of machine learning, constructing good risk prediction and prognostic models has been drawing renewed attention. In this development, much effort is concentrated in identifying good predictors of patient outcomes, although the same level of rigor is often absent in improving the outcome side of prediction. The majority of popular supervised techniques (e.g., regularized logistic regression and its variations), which can be readily applied in risk model development, assumes that the prediction target is a clear single outcome measured at a single time point. In clinical reality, patient outcomes are often complex, multivariate, and measured with errors. Even when a target is a relatively clear univariate outcome (e.g., death, cancer, diabetes, etc), the process that leads to this ultimate outcome often involves complex intermediate outcomes, where predicting and understanding this intermediate process can be crucial in providing effective care and preventing negative ultimate outcomes. The situation calls for a ﬂexible learning framework that can easily incorporate this important but neglected aspect in model development - better characterizing and constructing prediction targets before building prediction models.  Focusing on risk labels as prediction targets, we propose a pragmatic 3-stage learning approach, where we sequentially 1) generate latent labels, 2) validate them using explicit validators, and 3) go on with supervised learning with labeled data. Latent variable (LV) strategies used in Satge 1 have great potentials in handling complex outcome information. The unsupervised nature of LV strategies makes highly ﬂexible data synthesis and organization possible. The same nature, however, can also be seen as esoteric and subjective, which is not desirable in situations where transparency and reproducibility are of great concern such as in risk prediction. As a practical solution to this problem, we propose the use of explicit clinical validators, which not only makes LV-based labels closely aligned with contemporary science and clinical practice, but also makes it possible to automatically validate and narrow a large pool of candidate labels. With the goal of developing a practical and transparent system of learning and inference for clinical research and practice, we formed a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in latent variable modeling, machine learning, psychometrics and causal inference along with clinical/substantive expertise. Our streamlined learning framework focuses on direct and transparent validation of latent variable solutions to ensure clear communication across risk model developers, clinical researchers and practitioners. The project ultimately aims to improve personalized treatment and care by improving risk prediction. Narrative This project intends to develop a pragmatic learning and risk predction framework that will facilitate utilization of multivariate data collected from research and health care services, which otherwise is underutilized in developing methods to improve personalized care of future patients. The project ultimately aims to improve personalized treatment and care by improving risk prediction, and therefore will have positive impact on public health.",A Pragmatic Latent Variable Learning Approach Aligned with Clinical Practice,10212944,R01MH123443,"['Address', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Intention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'data exploration', 'flexibility', 'health care service', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'model development', 'neglect', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'simulation', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,558490
"Developing and validating EHR-integrated readmission risk prediction models for hospitalized patients with diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hospital readmission is an undesirable, costly outcome that may be preventable. Hospitalized patients with diabetes are at higher risk of readmission within 30 days (30-d readmission) than patients without diabetes, and >1 million readmissions occur among diabetes patients in the US annually. Certain interventions can reduce readmission risk, but applying these interventions widely is cost prohibitive. One approach for improving the efficiency of interventions that reduce readmission risk is to target high-risk patients. We previously published a model, the Diabetes Early Readmission Risk Indicator (DERRITM), that predicts the risk of all-cause 30-d readmission of patients with diabetes. The DERRI, however, has modest predictive accuracy (C-statistic 0.63- 0.69), and requires manual data input. Recently, we demonstrated that adding variables to the DERRI substantially improves predictive accuracy (DERRIplus, C-statistic 0.82). However, using this larger model to predict readmission risk based on manual input of data would be too labor intensive for clinical settings. Indeed, most readmission risk prediction models are limited by the trade-off between accuracy and ease of use; lack of translation to a tool that integrates with clinical workflow; modest accuracy; lack of validation; and dependence on data only available after hospital discharge.  The objectives of the current proposal are: 1) To develop more accurate all-cause unplanned 30-d readmission risk prediction models using electronic health record (EHR) data of patients with diabetes (eDERRI); 2) To translate the models to an automated, EHR-based tool that predicts % readmission risk of hospitalized patients; and 3) To prospectively validate the eDERRI models and tool. The new eDERRI models will expand upon the variables in the DERRIplus based on availability in EHR data (e.g., sociodemographics, encounter history, medication use, laboratory results, comorbidities, and length of stay). To develop the models, we will leverage data from the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN), a multi-center, 40-plus hospital member of the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet). We will apply state-of-the-art deep-learning methods to develop optimal predictive models. This project will analyze a large, multi-center cohort of nearly 340,000 discharges with cutting-edge techniques to develop better models and translate them to an automated tool that predicts readmission risk for individual patients with diabetes. The proposed tool would identify higher risk patients more likely to benefit from intervention, thus improving care and reducing costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop more accurate models that predict the risk of repeat hospitalizations among patients with diabetes. The models will be programmed into a tool that will be integrated with an electronic health record system and automatically predict the re-hospitalization risk of patients. Such a tool could be used to identify higher risk diabetes patients more likely to benefit from intervention, thus improving care and reducing costs.",Developing and validating EHR-integrated readmission risk prediction models for hospitalized patients with diabetes,10245208,R01DK122073,"['Admission activity', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Paths', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patient Readmission', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comorbidity Index', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'readmission risk', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,562886
"Modifiable Risk Factors for the Emergence of Resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa Project Summary Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CR-P. aeruginosa) contributes to significant mortality in hospitalized patients. Only four β-lactam agents with activity against CR-P. aeruginosa are available in the US, of which ceftolozane-tazobactam (C-T) is the most frequently used to treat CR-P. aeruginosa. Pre-clinical investigations indicate C-T had activity against >90% of P. aeruginosa isolates; after clinical use, reports of P. aeruginosa that initially tested susceptible to C-T but became resistant during therapy emerged. Our preliminary data indicate that amongst 28 consecutive patients infected with CR-P. aeruginosa with isolates initially susceptible to C-T, 50% of patients had subsequent P. aeruginosa isolates with > 4-fold increase in C-T minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) up to 30 days after C-T exposure. We identified genetic markers contributing to resistance through whole genome sequencing (WGS) – notably mutations in the ampC-ampR region and in PBP3. Alarmingly, 86% of P. aeruginosa isolates initially susceptible to another novel antibiotic, ceftazidime-avibactam (C-A), exhibited resistance to C-A after C-T exposure - in the absence of C-A exposure. This is concerning as the emergence of resistance to one novel agent could eliminate the few remaining treatment options. We explored modifiable risk factors that could reduce the frequency of C-T resistance and found that 30% of patients who received C-T over 1 hour had subsequent C-T resistant isolates, whereas no patients who received the drug over 3 hours developed resistant isolates. We would like to repeat this exploratory work and include experimental validation studies in a cohort of 260 patients across seven hospitals who have paired P. aeruginosa clinical isolates stored at -80°C and were prescribed C-T. In Aim 1, WGS will identify the genetic loci associated with C-T resistance comparing paired CR-P. aeruginosa isolates from the same patient before and up to 30 days after C-T exposure. Validation will occur through cloning and site-directed mutagenesis work. Broth microdilution will determine susceptibility testing results for the three other β-lactams with activity against CR-P. aeruginosa to quantify the emergence of cross-resistance. In Aim 2, we will capitalize on diverse C-T administration strategies at participating sites and develop a machine learning derived decision tree to inform clinicians how to prescribe C-T most effectively to reduce the likelihood of acquired resistance. The following are some risk factors that will be investigated for potential inclusion: (1) infusion of C-T over 3 hours, (2) high-dose C-T, (3) combination antibiotic therapy, (4) dialysis dependency, (5) source of infection and source control, (6) number of days of C-T exposure. This work will (1) inform future drug development by identifying areas of the bacterial chromosome highly prone to resistance and in need of additional reinforcement and (2) identify modifiable risk factors that can be used by clinicians to enable novel antibiotics to remain effective treatment options for extended periods of time. Project Narrative Only four β-lactam antibiotics with activity against carbapenem-resistant-P. aeruginosa are available in the United States, of which ceftolozane-tazobactam (C-T) is the most frequently prescribed. Our preliminary data indicate that high-level resistance of CR-P. aeruginosa to C-T can occur shortly after clinical exposure to this agent. Using a cohort of 260 patients contributing paired CR-P. aeruginosa isolates before and after C-T exposure, we propose to: (1) identify and experimentally validate genetic markers leading to C-T resistance; (2) determine the frequency with which C-T resistance leads to cross-resistance to the three other β-lactam agents with activity against C-T; and (3) develop a machine-learning derived decision tree to inform clinicians of modifiable risk factors that could slow the emergence of resistance to C-T.",Modifiable Risk Factors for the Emergence of Resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa,10301838,R21AI153580,"['Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Area', 'Bacterial Chromosomes', 'Binding Sites', 'Case Series', 'Case Study', 'Ceftazidime', 'Clinical', 'Cloning', 'Combined Antibiotics', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Drug resistance', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Imipenem', 'Infection', 'Infusion procedures', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Monobactams', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Observational Study', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Point Mutation', 'Predisposition', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regrets', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Source', 'Tazobactam', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'VDAC1 gene', 'Validation', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'carbapenem resistance', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'combat', 'design', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic locus', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'pre-clinical', 'respiratory', 'urinary', 'validation studies', 'whole genome']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,275758
"Risk and strength: determining the impact of area-level racial bias and protective factors on birth outcomes. PROJECT SUMMARY There are large and persistent racial and ethnic disparities in preterm birth and low birth weight. Individual-level risk factors do not fully explain the observed disparities. There is increasing evidence for the role of area-level racial bias in explaining these disparities, but we currently lack both the measures, methods, and findings to empirically evaluate its influence. The proposed research will advance the research in all 3 areas. We will be using online and social media data and machine learning models to create two measures of area-level racial bias and implement a robust research design to determine whether area-level racial bias impacts birth outcomes. Our investigative team—comprised of experts in the field of epidemiology, health disparities, machine learning, social media data, biostatistics, and community engaged research—is uniquely suited to implement the study aims. Our Specific Aims are to 1) track and detect changes in area-level racial bias and identify local and national race-related events during these time points, 2) determine the impact of changes in area-level racial bias on changes in adverse birth outcomes, and 3) identify protective factors for adverse birth outcomes. Because our data is collected repeatedly and finely across the United States, we can explicitly account for temporal trends and place effects. The proposed study uses new data to capture trends in racial bias with sophisticated machine learning models, and represents a critical advancement in the investigation of racial disparities in birth outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individual-level risk factors are not fully explaining the large and persistent racial disparities in birth outcomes, limiting policy and intervention strategies to reduce these disparities. This project will advance our understanding of the potential effects of racial bias at a population level on the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight and identify protective factors to buffer its impact.",Risk and strength: determining the impact of area-level racial bias and protective factors on birth outcomes.,10096177,R01MD015716,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Birth Rate', 'Birth Weight', 'Buffers', 'California', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Focus Groups', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Individual', 'Infant Mortality', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Low Prevalence', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Natural experiment', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Policies', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Prejudice', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Site', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'Work', 'adverse birth outcomes', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'neural network', 'protective factors', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial bias', 'racial discrimination', 'racial disparity', 'racial identity', 'racism', 'resilience', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'stressor', 'trend']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,738087
"Development and clinical validation of multimodal risk algorithms for predicting future internalizing psychopathology I am currently Assistant Professor and a licensed clinical psychologist in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Vermont. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator using novel strategies in developmental neuroimaging to study mood and anxiety symptomatology from birth to maturity. Although I have been trained in the analysis of longitudinal structural MRI, I require further training in the processing and analysis of state-of-the-art multiband neuroimaging data that allows for more sensitive measures of brain connectivity. I am also lacking expertise with regard to more sophisticated analytic methods for more fully leveraging large-sample multimodal datasets. Such approaches will enable me to move beyond conventional univariate statistical analyses and prepare me for future Big Data initiatives. During the proposed K08 period, my overarching goal is to develop expertise in the application of machine-learning approaches to multimodal data in order to characterize the most salient psychosocial and brain-based predictors of youth internalizing psychopathology. To achieve these goals, I am pursuing career development and training activities in the following areas: 1) assessment and characterization of psychosocial risk factors; 2) theory and implementation of Big Data methods, including machine learning algorithms and cross-validation strategies; 3) analysis of multiband multimodal brain imaging data using Human Connectome Project pipelines with the aim of more comprehensively assessing aspects of cortico-limbic connectivity; 4) independently running my own neuroimaging research study; and 5) developing and submitting a competitive R01 application. In order to obtain this expertise, I am proposing training activities at several institutions, including the University of Vermont, Harvard Medical School, McGill University, and Oregon Health and Science University. The research project in this K08 proposal aims to produce risk algorithms for a transdiagnostic dimension of psychopathology, using novel machine learning approaches to leverage two of the largest longitudinal neuroimaging samples in the world (IMAGEN and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study). These risk algorithms will subsequently undergo refinement using a new sample of clinic-referred youths that I will recruit from an outpatient psychiatric clinic in Vermont. As part of the project, I will also test the degree to which these algorithms predict treatment response. These data will be used as pilot data for my planned R01 application. Given the methods that I am proposing, this project will be able to detect complex non-linear interactions involving risk factors from a multitude of domains. As a result, this work will inform, and help to delineate, various etiological pathways that ultimately result in internalizing problems. Most importantly, this project could inform early identification and targeted intervention strategies during a critical period for the development of internalizing symptomatology. !

"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence. The ability to prospectively predict depression prior to its initial onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth.",Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles,10051424,R01MH116969,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'algorithm development', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'kernel methods', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neural correlate', 'pleasure', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'socioeconomics', 'trait']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,532914
"Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study Project Summary In the U.S., approximately 840,000 Americans die from cardiovascular disease (CVD) each year. The prevalence of CVD is on the rise and widespread disparities in CVD exist across economic, racial, and ethnic groups. In order to address the rising prevalence of CVD and persistent disparities, there has been a shift in focus to public health strategies addressing cardiovascular health (CVH). CVH is a broader and more positive construct beyond the absence of CVD. Despite this recent focus on improving CVH, widespread disparities still exist. Social determinants of health (SDOH) may be important contributors to these continued disparities. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines SDOH as the “structural determinants and conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age.” There has been limited work in studying how a diverse set of SDOH change over time and perform in the prediction of CVH. To address this need, we will identify patterns of SDOH exposure over time and determine if the addition of SDOH variables allows for better prediction of an individual's CVH status. The primary hypothesis is that a diverse set of SDOH will be associated with and improve the prediction of CVH, independent of baseline CVH and other covariates. To examine this hypothesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) identify patterns of SDOH exposure up to age 50 and define exposure subgroups and 2) determine whether overall and domain-specific patterns of SDOH exposures from young adulthood to middle age, identified in Aim 1, are associated with and improve the prediction of CVH and its component metrics. We will utilize the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a prospective cohort study with detailed information on cardiovascular risk factors and disease in a geographically and racially diverse sample of young adults. In Aim 1, we will use a novel sequential pattern mining method to identify the associations among SDOH and determine the SDOH exposure patterns from baseline to age 50. The Aim 1 SDOH exposure definitions will be included as predictors of CVH at age 50 and beyond using supervised machine learning techniques. By including SDOH in predictive models, health services professionals and clinicians may have an improved understanding of patients at high-risk for low CVH and may better tailor social and clinical interventions to each patient's needs. If awarded, this fellowship will allow me to contribute novel research to the SDOH and cardiovascular health fields, gain competency in new research skills, and improve my writing and presentation skills. The completion of this project and training will prepare me for my long-term career goal of becoming an independent research scientist in an academic setting, studying SDOH and using data science and informatics tools to improve public health. Project Narrative The incorporation of social determinants of health (SDOH) in predictive models for cardiovascular health (CVH) may help health services professionals and clinicians in identifying patients at high-risk for low CVH. This has important public health implications because social and clinical interventions may be tailored to each patient's needs. This research may also help to identify which SDOH are predictive of CVH from young adulthood to middle age, allowing public health professionals to target specific SDOH through directed social, behavioral, and policy-related interventions.",Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study,10067371,F31HL151178,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Social Identification', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Writing', 'age group', 'base', 'biracial', 'built environment', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'cohort', 'fasting plasma glucose', 'good diet', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial difference', 'racial diversity', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social factors', 'social health determinants', 'supervised learning', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'young adult']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F31,2021,41249
"Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture Over 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the U.S. and up to 25% of hip-fracture patients die within a year of their injury. Despite the importance of this clinical problem, the diagnostic screening rate for osteoporosis is only 5% of the eligible population, and the sensitivity of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) by DXA, the clinical standard test for diagnosis, is only 50%. Therefore, most patients are not being screened diagnostically for osteoporosis, and for those who are, about half who will experience a hip fracture are missed. Given that the current empirical approach is inadequate, we propose to pursue a more mechanistic approach, combining state-of-the-art biomechanics and machine learning approaches. Biomechanically, the three etiological elements of hip fracture are fall risk, femoral strength, and femoral impact force. In this project, our overall goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how all three biomechanical etiological elements interact in the event of a hip fracture and from that, directly improve clinical fracture risk assessment through the use of a single predictive “Integral Biomechanical Risk (IBR)” parameter. In addition, we will also address the problem of low DXA screening rates by further developing our Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) technology. This test estimates the breaking strength of the femur using finite element analysis of routine clinical CT scans previously acquired for any medical reason, and represents an improvement compared to the use of BMD alone. Since millions of patients are scanned with CT each year, this approach could double screening rates if offered as an alternative to DXA. The proposed study will investigate this biomechanical approach in a large incident hip fracture, case-cohort study (3,000 patients with hip fracture, 6,000 without). This retrospective study will include patients seen at Kaiser Permanente who had an abdominal CT scan as part of medical care prior to any hip fracture; and have standard geriatric measurements in their electronic medical records, which we will use to estimate fall risk. Specifically, our aims are to: 1) utilize electronic medical record data and CT scans to obtain patient-specific measurements related to fall risk, femoral strength, and fall severity, and 2) combine the different elements of hip fracture etiology into the IBR parameter to test the hypothesis that this metric predicts hip fracture independent of age, sex, BMI, race/ethnicity, and history of prior fracture and improves hip fracture prediction compared to the clinical standard (BMD with FRAX). Scientifically, a major novelty of this work is its use of contemporary machine learning algorithms to inform construction of a mechanistic model of the three etiological elements of hip fracture, which should better capture any interactions between these elements compared to a purely statistical-regression approach. In addition, the study cohort will be the largest and most diverse CT-based hip fracture cohort ever assembled. Importantly, positive results from this project would provide a compelling “second front” to DXA that could be quickly translated to widespread clinical practice, profoundly impacting osteoporosis care. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE More than half of individuals who experience hip fracture do not have osteoporosis as assessed by DXA. This project draws together the latest technological advances in CT-based finite element modeling and combines it into a probabilistic model of fracture risk that uses as inputs, data typically available in medical records. By going beyond BMD, the fracture risk prediction tool developed by this work aims to significantly improve clinical fracture risk assessment and substantially impact the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.",Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture,10144396,R01AR074958,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biomechanics', 'Blinded', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Density', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip Fractures', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intramuscular', 'Investigation', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Osteoporosis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive treatment', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal CT', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'bone', 'bone strength', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'diagnostic screening', 'ductile', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fracture risk', 'high risk', 'hip bone', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuromuscular', 'older patient', 'patient health information', 'risk prediction', 'screening', 'sex', 'soft tissue', 'standing height', 'theories', 'tool']",NIAMS,"O.

"4/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health, such as employment and educational attainment, can impact the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Research utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, and (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data. Successful completion of this study will substantially advance our understanding of the clinical utility of PRSs for commonly occurring psychiatric disorders.

"2/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities.

"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,10135919,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data repository', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'excessive weight gain', 'feasibility testing', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant adiposity', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2021,139614
"Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, thus representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype. Examination of abnormalities in SPD will provide information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. Although individuals with SPD demonstrate marked temporal lobe abnormalities that resemble SZ, we hypothesize that relative “sparing” or “functional enhancement” in the frontal lobes (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), may protect these individuals from frank psychosis and the severe social and cognitive deficits typically observed in SZ. Studying SPD is powerful as antipsychotic medication and hospitalization confounds observed in SZ are not present. Moreover, there is no study examining neurobiological changes in the SZ-spectrum that incorporates individuals with SPD using a longitudinal design as proposed here. This novel approach will help disentangle potential risk and protective factors for psychosis in the SZ spectrum. This is the first longitudinal study to utilize multimodal MR imaging and Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approaches in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry along a continuum from healthy controls (HCs) to SPD to SZ and examine changes in these measures in relationship to impairments in symptom severity, neurocognition and functional outcome. We propose studying three groups (80 in each) of demographically matched and rigorously diagnosed individuals (age 18- 40): HCs (no Axis I or personality disorder), unmedicated individuals with SPD (and no Axis I disorder), and early-onset (first 2 years of illness) SZ patients at baseline, 9-, and 18-month follow-up. Measures assessing frontal and temporal lobe integrity include multimodal MR imaging (structural MRI, DTI, resting-state fMRI, and task-based fMRI with a nonverbal event related working-memory task; baseline and 18-months) and neuropsychological assessment (all three timepoints). We will utilize dynamic causal modeling to test competing neurobiological models involving abnormal frontotemporal connectivity in the SZ-spectrum and machine learning approaches to integrate multimodal neuroimaging, neurocognitive, and clinical assessment data. We focus on three specific aims: (1) Investigate the longitudinal course of frontal-temporal lobe/circuitry abnormalities in the SZ-spectrum using multimodal MR imaging; (2) Investigate the longitudinal course of neurocognition, clinical, and functional outcome in the SZ spectrum; (3) Determine which factor or combination of factors differentiate groups in the SZ-spectrum to identify those that are associated with risk for and protection from SZ using machine learning.

"Understanding the mechanisms by which weight change affects progression of knee osteoarthritis in obese and overweight individuals: An analysis of the Osteoarthritis Initiative Dataset Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease which affects more than 27 million people in the US and is the single most common cause of disability in older adults. The number of people affected with symptomatic OA will increase due to the aging of the population and the growing number of people with obesity, which represents an established risk factor for OA. Obesity has become a US “epidemic,” and projections have suggested that 86.3% of adults in the United States will be overweight or obese by 2030. Obesity is a modifiable risk factor for OA with weight loss offering a potential non-invasive therapy for disease prevention in obese and overweight individuals. Research has shown that weight loss slows OA progression and weight gain exacerbates progression. However, these studies did not specifically assess factors or pathways which would be responsible for improved or worse outcomes, such as associated inflammation, local body composition and sarcopenia. In the current proposal, we will comprehensibly examine the mechanisms associated with mechanical loading (weight loss and gain) that are responsible for driving knee joint degenerative changes including cartilage loss, namely concurrent changes in inflammation, local body composition (periarticular fat), and muscle morphology and strength. Identifying which mechanism(s) are most beneficial for slowing OA progression during weight loss will lead to targeted therapies for effective and optimized treatment of OA at early stages of disease during which progression may be prevented. Through pathway analysis, mediation analysis, and machine learning, we will identify potential preventive measures (such as muscle strengthening and anti-inflammatory measures) that could amplify the positive effects of reduced mechanical loading on OA. Thus, the clinical impact of our project is development of a subject-specific prediction model for clinicians to individually-tailor treatment plans that slow joint breakdown, and decrease probability for invasive and costly surgeries such as total knee arthroplasty. Three specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: We will characterize the associations between changes in weight with changes in knee joint inflammation, local body composition, muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), fat infiltration and muscle strength, and investigate the associations between these parameters and progression of knee degenerative changes. Specific Aim 2: Using a path analysis we will explore the mechanisms by which weight change impacts OA progression, and quantify the degree to which these factors mediate this relationship. Specific Aim 3: Finally, we will develop a prediction model using machine learning to determine which demographic, clinical, and MRI features (including changes in local body composition, inflammation, muscle) can predict progression of OA over 8 years. Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance) While obesity is a modifiable risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA), studies analyzing the impact of weight loss in overweight and obese people have found inconsistent results on structural progression of knee OA. One potential explanation for these findings, and at the same time a major gap of knowledge in previous research, is that studies have not specifically assessed factors or pathways which, together with mechanical load, are responsible for improved or worse outcomes, such as associated inflammation, local body composition and sarcopenia. The overall goal of our proposal is to elucidate which mechanisms are responsible for slowing progression during weight loss, and which are most beneficial to develop individualized treatment plans targeting specific pathways that will enhance the positive effects of weight loss on slowing OA progression.",Understanding the mechanisms by which weight change affects progression of knee osteoarthritis in obese and overweight individuals: An analysis of the Osteoarthritis Initiative Dataset,10180705,R01AR078917,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemistry', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Composition', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Epidemic', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Preventive measure', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Stress', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'base', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder prevention', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'joint destruction', 'joint inflammation', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'mechanical load', 'modifiable risk', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'obese person', 'personalized risk prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'risk prediction model', 'sarcopenia', 'strength training', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,714433
"Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions Project Summary/Abstract Atrial Fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke 5-fold and accounts for roughly 15% of all strokes in the United States. Many individuals may have undiagnosed AF whose arrhythmia does not prompt evaluation either because of minimal symptoms or brief episodes. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is highly effective at reducing stroke risk in patients with AF, but is only prescribed to individuals with recognized disease. Identifying subjects with undiagnosed AF is important so they may be treated with OAC and prevent strokes from occurring. This project will help advance our knowledge of screening patients for undiagnosed AF in the primary care setting by identifying patients at high risk of developing AF for targeted clinic and home-based screening strategies. Fundamental questions of who to target and how to implement a screening program in the United States remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic and content area training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To identify predictors of AF incidence from electronic health record structured and free-text data, 2) To develop and implement an electronic algorithm that improves upon existing models to identify patients at increased risk for AF in a primary care population, and 3) To implement and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of a clinic and home-based screening program to identify undiagnosed AF. This project aligns with several objectives of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Strategic Vision by implementing novel diagnostic tools to diagnose AF and prevent strokes, by optimizing clinical and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease, and leveraging emerging opportunities in data science, through the use of natural language processing of text data in the electronic health record, to improve identification of patients at high risk for AF. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in cardiovascular disease and targeting populations for prevention of cardiovascular disease events. Career development activities include training in biomedical informatics, data mining and risk prediction, survey research design, implementation research, and cardiovascular disease pathophysiology and clinical management through formal coursework, clinical shadowing, as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will improve prediction of which patients are at the highest risk of developing AF, and evaluate how to use this risk information to implement an effective screening strategy in primary care. Pilot data from this award will lay the groundwork for a highly competitive application for NIH R01 funding. Project Narrative Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of ischemic stroke and the prevalence is estimated to increase from 5.2 million adults in the United States to more than 12 million by 2030, however, many additional individuals have undiagnosed disease. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of screening for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, by 1) improving identification of patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation, and 2) targeting patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation in the primary care setting with an efficient strategy for clinic and home-based screening. This program will significantly increase knowledge of how to overcome the real-world issue of how to effectively and efficiently screen for atrial fibrillation in clinical practice.",Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions,10188627,K01HL148506,"['Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Massachusetts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Senior Scientist', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data registry', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient screening', 'population based', 'practice setting', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'risk minimization', 'risk prediction', 'screening', 'screening program', 'stroke risk', 'structured data', 'tool', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2021,177788
"1/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of ProdromE Risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains. This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative  Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",1/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of ProdromE Risk,10122994,R01MH120090,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'online delivery', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,583239
