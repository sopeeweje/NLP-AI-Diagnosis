"High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors Abstract:  This is an application for a K22 award for Dr. John Paul Shen, a medical oncologist currently at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Shen is establishing himself as a young translational investigator in the field of cancer genomics. This K22 award will provide Dr. Shen with the resources and training to accomplish the following objectives; (1) implement advanced computational methods on genome scale datasets (2) become an expert in functional genomics, (3) achieve proficiency experimenting in mouse models of cancer, (4) successfully manage an independent laboratory. To achieve these objectives, after accepting a faculty position Dr. Shen will assemble a diverse advisory committee including experts in bioinformatics, experimental cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  It was proposed by many that the ability to sequence a tumor genome, now made possible by next- generation sequencing, would bring about a new era of precision oncology in which chemotherapy choices would be individualized to match a single tumor and patient. However, the use genomic information in clinical practice remains limited by the fact that currently very few mutations are associated with response to a specific drug. This is particularly true in Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, where there are few targeted therapy options and few effective biomarkers help guide chemotherapy selection. Dr. Shen seeks to address this pressing need by employing high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.  Recognizing that there will be great heterogeneity from one tumor to the next, even within the same cancer type, the functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist. Using network-based machine learning methods applied to chemo-genomic viability data in molecularly characterize cell lines it is expected that predictive biomarkers will be identified for both novel targeted agents and currently used chemotherapy drugs. This will allow oncologists to design individualized chemotherapy regimens for each patient. Project Narrative  Although the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies has had a major impact on many tumor types, there is currently a lack of effective targeted drugs for patients with cancers of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This proposal seeks to address this pressing need by using novel high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically. The functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist.",High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors,10077788,K22CA234406,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR screen', 'California', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Characteristics', 'Chemoresistance', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Faculty', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Guide RNA', 'Heterogeneity', 'K22 Award', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Medical Oncologist', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Somatic Mutation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'colon cancer cell line', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'drug development', 'druggable target', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'homologous recombination', 'individual patient', 'irinotecan', 'loss of function', 'machine learning method', 'mouse model', 'mutational status', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'oxaliplatin', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'precision oncology', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'targeted agent', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K22,2021,192240
"Software for sequencing human antibody proteins from polyclonal immune responses The natural immune response to foreign pathogens involves a complex coordination of cells, including an adaptive response to select and secrete antibodies into circulation. Individuals who have recovered from a pathogenic infection retain immune memory and continue to circulate pathogen-specific antibodies. For many infectious diseases like respiratory syncytial virus, Ebola, and poxviruses, antibodies with neutralizing activity to multiple viral strains have been discovered from human survivors. The discovered antibodies are highly valuable as potential biologic therapeutics for the broader population, as the antibodies have been naturally optimized to defend against human pathogens.  Efforts to discover antibodies from humans recovering from coronavirus infection are underway, SARS-CoV-2 in particular, but are hampered by the limitations of existing antibody discovery platforms. Current approaches require screening for live B cells actively producing pathogen-specific antibodies, which are sensitive to cell death and rarely found in blood. In contrast, antibody protein is stable and pathogen-reactive antibodies are abundant in serum. While protein is the ideal material to start with, characterization of polyclonal antibody (pAb) protein presents new challenges.  Recent advances in mass spectrometry and analysis have shown individual antibody candidates can be derived from affinity-purified pAb proteins when a sufficiently matched B-cell genetic antibody repertoire is provided. We aim to develop algorithms to supplant the need of a genetic antibody repertoire, and de novo identify antibody candidates from limited complexity pAb samples. This is achieved by improvements to de novo peptide sequencing using machine learning, and targeted assembly of specificity determining regions (CDR3s) and antibody frameworks using de Bruijn graphs. The proposed software will provide estimates of clonal diversity and candidate sequences that can be synthesized and tested for reactivity. In addition to addressing needs for infectious diseases, as demonstrated with an urgent unmet need to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, the software also applies to clinical and biomedical research needs in autoimmune disease, and commercial interests in replacing polyclonal antibody reagents with highly reproducible monoclonal antibody equivalents. The antibody repertoire circulating in serum is the most active component to an immune response, yet is unable to be directly queried without aid from the genetic antibody repertoire from cells. Our innovative algorithms enable querying and sequencing of antibodies directly from protein - opening the door to previously inaccessible autoimmune and infectious disease research and therapeutic antibody discovery.",Software for sequencing human antibody proteins from polyclonal immune responses,10140073,R44GM140607,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Circulation', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coronavirus', 'Coronavirus Infections', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Ebola', 'Exposure to', 'Fingerprint', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mus', 'Oncology', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Population', 'Poxviridae', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Respiratory syncytial virus', 'Salvelinus', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Services', 'Specificity', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Transcript', 'Vaccine Design', 'Viral', 'adaptive immune response', 'analytical method', 'communicable disease diagnosis', 'cost', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'member', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'polyclonal antibody', 'proteogenomics', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,"DIGITAL PROTEOMICS, LLC",R44,2021,802944
"Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a fatal lung disease that is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite an estimated $50 billion in yearly healthcare costs, it has no current cure and only palliat- ive treatments. COPD is clearly characterized by chronic lung inflammation that likely arises from dysregulat- ion of complex networks of immune factors and cells across multiple tissue compartments. Although multiple individual genes and proteins have been associated with COPD risk and progression, global mechanistic understanding of its pathophysiology is lacking, particularly regarding the marked heterogeneity in COPD phenotypes. The overall objective of our study is to gain systems-level insight into complex inflammatory and immune mechanisms underlying COPD, by applying data-driven (also called ‘machine learning’) modeling approaches to clinical samples collected from human pulmonary microenvironments and matched immune cell networks from peripheral blood. Our central hypothesis is that immune networks will be more predictive of COPD phenotype, progression, and exacerbation than individual factors. We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims, using matched brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood samples collected in SPIROMICS I and II clinical trials. Aim 1 will identify changes in immune cell-cell communication networks, by high-throughput cytokine measurements from stimulated systems of peripheral blood immune cells from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls (collected from the upcoming SPIROMICS II visit; n=150). Aim 2 will determine systems-level changes that occur in the inflamed lung microenvironment, using high-throughput cytokine measurements in BAL samples (both archival from SPIROMICS I, n=200, and collected during upcoming SPIROMICS II bronchoscopies) from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls. We will identify networks associated with longitudinal clinical progression and exacerbation frequency. Aim 3 will integrate measurements across lung and blood tissue compartments to define key combinatorial relationships associated with progression and exacerbation events. Overall, this project will provide systems- level insight into COPD pathogenesis and progression, and create a new paradigm for the study of other pulmonary conditions involving chronic inflammation, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung transplant. Results will aid in the future development of new non-invasive diagnostic assays and will guide systems-level mechanistic studies that could result in new combinatorial therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to gain new systems-level insight into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is the third leading cause of death worldwide and an enormous cost burden in the U.S. yearly (~50 billion). Despite progress in identifying individual immune factors associated with COPD, there are only palliative treatment options and no cure. New insight generated by this project into how immune cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments are altered in COPD could be used to identify diagnostic biomarkers and to guide the design of combinatorial therapies.",Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD,10111555,R01HL144849,"['Accounting', 'Archives', 'Asthma', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Death Records', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Irrigation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adjudicate', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'detector', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'insight', 'never smoking', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,319844
"Applying deep learning to predict T cell receptor binding specificity of neoantigens and response to checkpoint inhibitors Project Summary Background: In-depth study of neoantigens will promote our knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms of basic immunology and immune-related disease processes, such as response to cancer immunotherapy. Neoantigens play a key role in the recognition of tumor cells by T cells and are increasingly shown to be targets of checkpoint inhibitor-induced immune response. However, several missing links exist in neoantigen research. (1) Only a small proportion of neoantigens can elicit T cell responses. It is even less clear which neoantigens will be recognized by which specific T cell receptor (TCR). (2) Although neoantigens are important during the course of action of immunotherapies, how neoantigen repertoire data can be used to predict patient response is only poorly understood. (3) The lack of standardized analysis pipelines and limited sharing of neoantigen data have hindered efficient and consistent research in the tumor immunogenomics field. Aim 1: Build a transfer learning-based model to predict immunogenicity of neoantigens. So far, only a very limited number of reports have created predictive models determining whether a neoantigen/MHC complex can elicit any T cell response. Even fewer of them are capable of predicting the TCR-binding specificity of neoantigens. However, the capability to predict the overall immunogenicity and the TCR-binding specificity of neoantigens is critical for improving the benefit of immunotherapy. Aim 1 addresses this challenge with advanced transfer learning algorithms, followed by benchmarking and laboratory validations. Aim 2: Predict response to checkpoint inhibitors by integration of the immunogenicity and other properties of all neoantigens in a patient, through a Bayesian multi-instance learning model. To date, most studies have focused on the neoantigen/mutation load approach in correlation with response of patients to immunotherapy administration. This simplistic approach misses the rich information contained in the whole repertoire of neoantigens per patient and has been successful in only a few studies, but not others. Aim 2 addresses this important inadequacy by creating a Bayesian multi-instance learning model that fully considers various quality features, including immunogenicity, of all neoantigens in a patient for prediction of treatment response. Aim 3: Create a web portal to provide neoantigen-related computational services and to share neoantigen data. The PI will establish a public webserver providing cloud-based standardized services, including prediction of neoantigens and the advanced analysis methods developed in Aim 1 and 2. The webserver will openly share neoantigen/TCR and patient phenotype data, in accordance with IRB and HIPAA regulations. Expected impact: (1) This project will predict the immunogenicity of neoantigens, which could inform neoantigen vaccine development. (2) This project will predict response to checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy based on patient neoantigen profiles. (3) The neoantigen database will propel research and also lead to clinical applications for cancers and other immune-related diseases, such as COVID-19. Project Narrative We will develop deep learning-based models to predict the TCR binding specificity of neoantigens/MHC complexes (immunogenicity). We will predict patient response to checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy based on immunogenicity and other properties of neoantigens. We will build a comprehensive neoantigen webserver, which will facilitate a coordinated effort to accelerate tumor immunogenomics research and clinical applications for personalized medicine.",Applying deep learning to predict T cell receptor binding specificity of neoantigens and response to checkpoint inhibitors,10180781,R01CA258584,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'COVID-19', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Extramural Activities', 'Feedback', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunogenomics', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MHC antigen', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publications', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'data sharing', 'data sharing networks', 'deep learning', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'laboratory experiment', 'learning algorithm', 'neglect', 'neoantigen vaccine', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'statistics', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'vaccine development', 'web portal']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,378897
"Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects around 50% of the US population. Even though the CMV exists in a latent state in healthy individuals, it profoundly shapes the immune system. Recent studies suggest that the CMV infection alters the immune response to influenza vaccine. However, the exact effect of CMV on the efficacy of the influenza vaccine remains controversial. In addition, how CMV shapes the immune responses toward other vaccines are unknown. We hypothesize that latent CMV infection induces critical changes in the immune system, which alters the efficacy of multiple types of vaccines. The ImmPort database currently hosts 133 vaccine studies, covering 21 types of vaccines, creating an unprecedented opportunity for us to test our hypothesis. We will perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to test the relationship between CMV and vaccine efficacies, and will use state-of-art statistical models (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian Network) to identify the mechanism by which CMV alters the vaccine response. Leveraging the group's expertise in computational immunology and rich datasets on ImmPort, we will address the following aims. Aim1: Test the effect of CMV on influenza vaccine outcome. We will perform a meta-analysis of 60 influenza studies available on ImmPort to test the impact of CMV. We will quantify and standardize the efficacy of influenza vaccine across studies, which are measured by hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assays before and after the vaccination. We will also determine the CMV infection status in subjects, either directly from serological tests or indirectly from immune- phenotyping data using cutting-edge machine learning tools. We will then test if CMV increases the response to influenza vaccine by analyzing data from all studies in a unified statistical framework while taking the heterogeneity between studies into account. Aim2: Bayesian network analysis of influenza vaccine response. We will harmonize multimodal immune-phenotyping data from the influenza vaccine studies, including transcriptomics data, cytometry data, and cytokine measurements. We will use state-of-art network analysis methods (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian network) to model the interplay between the immune components over time. Using the Bayesian network, we will investigate the mechanism by which CMV shapes the outcome of influenza vaccination. Aim3: Explore the effect of CMV infection on other vaccines. We will extend our analysis to vaccines other than influenza vaccine, (e.g., West Nile, Hepatitis B, yellow fever, malaria, and Tuberculosis). We will quantify the vaccine efficacy using assays specific to the vaccine type, such as Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) for the malaria vaccine and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test for the yellow fever vaccine. We will perform separate network analyses to characterize the relationship between CMV and the immune response of individual vaccines. We will then perform joint analysis across vaccine types to identify the common impact of CMV across vaccine types. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious diseases remain an urgent problem, resulting in an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide and more than 110,000 deaths in the United States annually, but the efficacy of vaccines against many infectious diseases remains suboptimal, including malaria, influenza, and dengue. To improve the vaccines, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect the immune response toward vaccines. In this study, we investigate how cytomegalovirus affects the efficacy of multiple vaccines, providing valuable information for improving the design of vaccines.",Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy,10171553,UH2AI153016,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections', 'Cytomegalovirus Vaccines', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatitis B', 'Herpesviridae', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Serology test', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Latency', 'West Nile virus', 'Yellow Fever', 'Yellow Fever Vaccine', 'cytokine', 'design', 'improved', 'individual response', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'malaria infection', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH2,2021,201875
"Defining cellular states of quiescence in human brain tumors PROJECT SUMMARY The most aggressive type of brain tumor, grade IV glioma known as glioblastoma (GBM), is one of the few tumor types with both a poor outcome and minimal improvement in survival in the past decades. For GBM, like other solid cancers, intratumoral heterogeneity is likely an important factor in mediating therapeutic response. In particular, quiescent, G0-like subpopulations may engender tumors with more robust responses to treatment regimens and allow for tumor regrowth after standard of care (SOC). However, G0-like tumor populations are currently ill-defined, even after application of single cell genomics to GBM. Our failure to fully comprehend and experimentally model quiescent/G0-like states represents a critical knowledge gap, but also a key opportunity, for glioma and other cancers, as neutralizing G0 cells could effectively prevent chemoradiotherapy resistance and tumor recurrence. The purpose of this grant is to provide a functional and molecular definition of G0-like states in GBM tumors and their responses to SOC. In Aim 1, we will define molecular networks governing long- and short-term quiescent states in GBM patient tumors using a novel G0 reporter system in combination with single cell genomic analysis. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that dormant G0 GBM cells have unique RNA and chromatin signatures required for SOC survival and tumor regrowth. In Aim 3, we will study and nominate the NuA4/KAT5 lysine acetyltransferase complex as a key regulator of G0-like states in GBM and candidate therapeutic target. The Aims are built on strong preliminary data, including: the creation of a machine learning-based method for identifying G0-like cells in gliomas, integrated analysis of single cell RNA and chromatin analysis of primary and PDX GBM tumors with standard of care, a functional genomic screen to identify regulators of GBM G0, and key experimental models to functionally dissect G0 states in GBM tumor models. If successful, this grant will produce a new working model for GBM G0-like states, provide key genes and gene networks associated with G0, and analysis tools for identifying G0-like states in clinical samples. It will also define how these populations respond to SOC and shift tumor dynamics during recurrence. Finally, it will provide data for a new therapeutic strategy, ""downgrading"", where grade IV tumors are made less aggressive by triggering extended or permanent G0-like states in tumor cells. NARRATIVE Solid tumor recurrence is likely driven by slow dividing or quiescent tumor subpopulations in the primary tumor which survive treatment regimens and give rise to secondary tumors. However, we currently lack a basic understanding of molecular features of these populations and, as a result, do not have effective therapeutic strategies to neutralize them. The experiments described in this proposal are directly relevant to public health because they will identify and dissect molecular vulnerabilities that can eliminate tumor subpopulations resistant to conventional therapies.",Defining cellular states of quiescence in human brain tumors,10101272,R01NS119650,"['Acetyltransferase', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adopted', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cancer Model', 'Caring', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Experimental Models', 'Failure', 'G0 Phase', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Grant', 'HTATIP gene', 'Human', 'Indolent', 'Knowledge', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mitosis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Radiation', 'Recombinant DNA', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Secondary to', 'Solid', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'chemoradiation', 'conventional therapy', 'epigenetic regulation', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'member', 'neoplasm resource', 'neoplastic cell', 'neurogenesis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'prevent', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'standard of care', 'stem-like cell', 'temozolomide', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target', 'therapeutically effective', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NINDS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,553130
"Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy The long-term goal of this P01 is to understand the intersection of radiation biology and cancer immunology and to translate this research into better therapies with curative potential for patients with cancer. Radiation therapy (RT) can systemically impact the immune system, and recent clinical success of PD1 and CTLA4 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has given rise to our overarching hypothesis that the immune stimulatory effects of RT can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with dual ICB across multiple histologies. Our preliminary data and investigative approach bridges studies in both patients and animal models. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which require close coordination of projects and cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients on two clinical trials: (i) nivolumab (PD1 mAb) and ipilimumab (CTLA4 mAb) with or without hypofractionated RT (HFRT) in a randomized phase II study in metastatic melanoma; and (ii) and tremelimumab (CTLA4 mAb) and durvalumab (PDL1 mAb) with HFRT at two dose schedules in metastatic pancreatic, lung, and breast carcinoma. In Project 2, we will determine the role of RT in establishing cancer immunity, evaluating the mechanism of anti-viral signaling through pattern recognition receptors and non-coding RNA and examining dendritic cell biology and CD40 activation. In Project 3, we will define the genetic and epigenetic basis of resistance to RT and ICB and examine PDL1 independent pathways to overcome this. Biomarkers revealed in Projects 2 and 3 will be examined using human samples from the clinical trials in Project 1. The Cores for this P01 are essential for our progress including provision of administration support for collaboration (Core A), a state-of-the-art platform for small animal radiation (Core B), and bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to drive deep learning from data generated in all Projects (Core C). The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune therapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer. Overall Narrative Our goal is to demonstrate that the immune stimulatory effects of radiation therapy (RT) can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with CTLA-4 and PD-1 across multiple histologies. Our approach involves two immediate clinical trials, mechanistic studies in human samples, mechanistic and discovery studies in mouse models, and sharing of data and scientific insight between 3 Projects and 3 Cores. The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune therapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer.  ",Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy,10005144,P01CA210944,"['Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Breast Carcinoma', 'CTLA4 blockade', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Discipline', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Dose', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferons', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Ligands', 'Local Therapy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nivolumab', 'PD-1 blockade', 'Pancreatic carcinoma', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Phase', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Interaction', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiobiology', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Translating', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'epigenomics', 'exhaust', 'exhaustion', 'immune activation', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunoregulation', 'insight', 'ipilimumab', 'irradiation', 'lung Carcinoma', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'phase 2 study', 'phase I trial', 'preclinical efficacy', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'programs', 'radiation effect', 'radiation response', 'randomized trial', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'success', 'synergism', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P01,2021,2275599
"Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy Project Summary/Abstract The blockade of inhibitory immune checkpoints has transformed the treatment of cancer for patients across a broad range of malignancies. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is achieved by administering antibodies that block the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway to reinvigorate antitumor T cell activity. Despite treatment responses that are unprecedented and durable, the majority of patients do not experience a clinical benefit from treatment, and some responders relapse and acquire resistance. Moreover, response patterns of tumors treated with ICB are unconventional, and can be misinterpreted as disease progression by radiographic imaging. To maximize the precision and benefit of ICB therapy, identification of predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers to objectively assess immune responses has rapidly emerged as a clinical priority. The proposal aims to leverage protease activity as predictive biomarkers for monitoring ICB response and resistance. Proteases play a central role in the underlying biology of immunity, oncology, and anti-tumor responses. The mark of a “hot” tumor is signified by an effective immune infiltrate of cytotoxic T cells that lyse cancer cells via the classical perforin- and granzyme-mediated pathway – the latter of which comprise a family of potent serine proteases. Tumor expression of proteases, including inflammatory and matrix degrading proteases, is well-established as a hallmark of fundamental tumor processes including angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis. The central hypothesis is that quantifying the activity of T cell and tumor proteases early-on-treatment will allow identification of activity biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy and indicate resistance to ICB therapy. To achieve these goals, this proposal aims to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade antibodies that are endowed with the dual capacity to inhibit immune checkpoints and sense protease activity during treatment responses. These activity sensing ICB diagnostics, or IDB-Dx, comprise -PD-1 or -CTLA-4 antibodies that are site-specifically functionalized with a library of mass-barcoded peptide substrates. During responses to ICB, these peptides are cleaved by T cell and tumor proteases that are elevated in “hot” tumors, liberating a unique fingerprint of mass barcodes that are then filtered into the recipient’s urine for quantification by mass spectrometry. By applying machine learning algorithms, these signatures of protease activity are trained and validated as predictive classifiers to discriminate “hot” and “cold” tumors, responders from non-responders, and resistance to therapy. Project Narrative Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade is transforming the treatment of cancer patients. Although some patients experience durable responses, new methods are required to identify patient responders, evaluate unconventional immune responses, and detect immune resistance. We propose to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade therapies that harness protease activity for predictive monitoring of treatment response and resistance.",Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy,10116320,R01CA237210,"['Antibodies', 'Antitumor Response', 'Bar Codes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caspase', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease Progression', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granzyme', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Inflammatory', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Peptidyltransferase', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Recombinants', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serine Protease', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transcript', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urinalysis', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'checkpoint inhibition', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'humanized mouse', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immune resistance', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'perforin', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'pharmacodynamic biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'resistance mechanism', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'sortase', 'success', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,339613
"Integrative molecular dissection of acquired resistance to PD1/PD-L1 blockade in localized and metastatic urothelial carcinoma Project Summary/Abstract Metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) is generally incurable with modest survival benefit provided by first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy and post-platinum PD1/L1 inhibitor therapy. Optimal therapy for progressive mUC following PD1/L1 inhibitors is necessary with new agents for this setting (enfortumab vedotin, erdafitinib) providing modest incremental benefits coupled with toxicities. Limited data exist for analysis of tumor acquired after PD1/L1 inhibitor systemic therapy, which is necessary to determine causes of both response and resistance. Indeed, multiplatform analyses of post-PD1/L1 inhibitor UC tumor have not been reported. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that tumor, immune and stromal microenvironmental factors determine resistance to PD-1/L1 therapy mUC, and that integrated bulk and single cell molecular dissection of post-treatment tumors will reveal these features. We propose innovative and potentially transformative multiplatform longitudinally obtained bulk and/or single cell (sc) analysis of pre and post PD1/L1 inhibitor tumor tissue and plasma from muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and mUC to shed deep insights regarding tumor biology and resistance and information that can be used to develop new therapies. We will perform detailed multiplatform analyses on 2 separate cohorts totaling 170 patients: 1) tumor tissue obtained before and after PD1/L1 inhibitor exposure or untreated controls (n=130) and 2) plasma cell-free (cf)-DNA obtained before and after PD1/L1 inhibitor exposure or untreated controls (n=40). Whole exome sequencing (WES), RNA-Seq and orthogonal multiparametric IHC for immune markers is performed of baseline transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens and post-therapy tumors. Patients included are from trials that evaluated a PD1/L1 inhibitor (n=70) as neoadjuvant therapy preceding RC for MIBC, or who received a PD1/L1 inhibitor for mUC (n=50) and control untreated and temporally separated serial FFPE tumors without intervening therapy (n=10). scRNAseq is performed on a subset of post-PD1/L1 mUC tumors (n=20) to analyze tumor, stromal and immune cells. WES is performed for immunogenomic analyses using quality-controlled plasma cfDNA obtained before and after PD1/L1 inhibitor therapy or control untreated patients (n=40). The functional relevance of specific genomic alterations and resultant predicted neoantigens is studied by examining functional immune and stromal readouts, which will shed insights regarding the immunogenicity of genomic alterations that can then provide the foundation for therapeutic advances. We will develop a novel integrated model using deep learning architecture to account for the stationary snapshot of the molecular tumor, stromal and immune profiles, and the time-based trajectory of clinical data to computationally aggregate heterogeneous data types. To summarize, this innovative study is expected to provide discoveries regarding determinants of UC progression following PD1/L1 inhibitors, an incurable disease setting with substantial unmet needs. Project Narrative Progressive metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) and muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with persistent disease at radical cystectomy (RC) following PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors has significant unmet needs. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that tumor, microenvironmental and immune cell genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic factors determine resistance to PD-1/L1 inhibitor therapy and metastasis in MIBC and mUC, and that integrated bulk and single cell molecular dissection of pre-treatment and post- treatment resistant tumors will reveal these features. This innovative study uses deep learning computational techniques to probe tumor biology of 170 patients to dissect the evolution of urothelial carcinoma resistance to PD1/L1 inhibitors and reveal potentially actionable therapeutic targets.",Integrative molecular dissection of acquired resistance to PD1/PD-L1 blockade in localized and metastatic urothelial carcinoma,10218294,R21CA249875,"['Aftercare', 'Architecture', 'Biopsy', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Blood', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonality', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Technique', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Evolution', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Genetic Fingerprintings', 'Genomics', 'Harvest', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunogenomics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mononuclear', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Myomatous neoplasm', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'New Agents', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'PD-1/PD-L1', 'PD-L1 blockade', 'PDL1 inhibitors', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Cells', 'Platinum', 'Ploidies', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stromal Cells', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Harvesting', 'Toxic effect', 'Transitional Cell Carcinoma', 'Transurethral Resection', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell free DNA', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disorder control', 'exome sequencing', 'heterogenous data', 'immunogenicity', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'macrophage', 'muscle invasive bladder cancer', 'neoantigens', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optimal treatments', 'pembrolizumab', 'peripheral blood', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2021,476334
"Developing new therapeutic strategies for pediatric tumors that lack clinically actionable mutations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cancer is the leading disease-related cause of death in children. Treatment has remained largely unchanged in decades, relying primarily on aggressive cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation—these therapies have debilitating long-term consequences. Precision medicine has yet to make a major impact on childhood cancer because, while thousands of pediatric tumor genomes have been sequenced, most children have very few somatic mutations compared to adult cancers. This means targeted cancer drugs are not an option for most children and fewer tumor-specific neoantigens means most immunotherapies are ineffective. However, in the last 5 years, large-scale CRISPR and drug screening studies in cancer cell lines, such as the Dependency Map (DepMap), have shown that in many cancers, unmutated genes can also act as potent drug targets. These genes are known as non-oncogene dependencies. The overall goal of this project is to overcome the low mutation burden, by identifying the druggable non-oncogene dependencies of pediatric tumors and to perform the requisite in vitro and in vivo experimental work to move these therapies to the clinic. We will identify these non-oncogene dependencies by applying tools from machine learning to perform integrative analysis of large pre-clinical screening datasets (such as DepMap, CCLE, and PRISM) with patient tumor -omics data. This will allow us to nominate specific non-oncogene dependencies for pediatric tumor subtypes, defined based on, for example, whole-genome gene expression or methylation data. We will mechanistically validate the top hits using in vitro experimental assays. Additionally, almost all curative cancer treatments involve the rational combination of multiple therapies, however, existing methods to predict effective combinations perform poorly when tested on unseen data. Thus, our second aim is to apply an approach that we have developed based on targeted CRISPR knockout screening to identify synergistic drug combinations. We will validate these combinations in vivo using mouse models with patient-derived xenografts, leveraging shared resources already established at St. Jude. Finally, tumor heterogeneity is ultimately the downfall of every known cancer treatment; however, in pediatric tumors where the mutation burden is low, much of this heterogeneity is driven by cell state, rather than specific somatic mutations. We will dissect the influence of cell state on drug resistance using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics technologies applied to a drug-treated spontaneous mouse model of neuroblastoma. This will ultimately allow us to nominate new drug combinations explicitly targeting drug-resistant cell states. Overall, this research program will aim to build a pipeline at St. Jude to overcome some of the main challenges posed by the low number of somatic mutations in pediatric tumors and identify new therapeutic strategies for these patients. We have assembled a diverse world-class team of researchers with all components necessary for an eventual impact on patient care. PROJECT NARRATIVE The treatment of pediatric cancers has remained largely unchanged in decades, relying primarily on aggressive cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation, however, these therapies have debilitating long-term consequences. We will use new computational methodologies applied to large preclinical screening data from cancer cell lines and patient -omics datasets to investigate unmutated genes as potential drug targets in pediatric cancers (non-oncogene dependencies).

"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms. I propose that an unbiased characterization can be achieved with an interdisciplinary framework of single-cell resolution transcriptional and epigenetic measurements, that are integrated with principled computational tools.",Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment,10159875,R00CA230195,"['ATAC-seq', 'Accounting', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Donor Lymphocyte Infusion', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Equilibrium', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Impairment', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Measurement', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'interest', 'leukemic stem cell', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'refractory cancer', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'stem cell population', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R00,2021,153920
"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects.

"Novel Radiomics for Predicting Response to Immunotherapy for Lung Cancer ABSTRACT: In 2019, an estimated 228,150 patients in the US are expected to be diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A recent landmark development has been the approval of the immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1) for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC. These immunotherapy (IO) drugs have an excellent toxicity profile and have the potential to induce durable clinically meaningful responses. However, only 1 in 5 NSCLC patients treated with IO will have a favorable response. Unfortunately, the current tissue based biomarker approach to selecting patients for these treatments is sub- optimal due to the dynamic nature of the interaction of the immune system with the tumor. Given the prohibitive costs associated with IO (>$200K/year per patient), there is a critical unmet need for predictive biomarkers to identify which patients will not benefit from IO. Additionally, the current clinical standard to evaluating tumor response (i.e. RECIST and irRC which evaluate change in tumor size and nodule disappearance) is sub-optimal in evaluating early clinical benefit from IO drugs. This is due at least in part to the fact that some patients undergoing IO present apparent disease progression (pseudo-progression) on post-treatment CT scans.  Unlike the standard canon of radiomics (computer extracted features from radiographic scans) that assess textural or shape patterns, our group has been developing novel computer vision strategies to capture patterns of peri-tumoral heterogeneity (outside the tumor) and tumor vasculature from CT scans. In N>300 patients, our group has shown that (1) radiomics of vessel tortuosity on baseline, pre-treatment CT for NSCLC patients undergoing IO were significantly different between responders (less tortuous) and non-responders (more tortuous), (2) serial changes in these measurements were better predictors of early response to IO compared to clinical response criteria such as RECIST and irRC and (3) these radiomic attributes were associated with PD-L1 expression and degree of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes on baseline biopsies. Critically, these radiomic features predicted response for NSCLC patients treated with 3 different IO agents from 3 sites.  In this project we will further develop vasculature, peri- and intra-tumoral radiomic features for monitoring and predicting benefit and early response for NSCLC patients treated with IO. We will uniquely train our radiomics using a set of N>180 resected NSCLC patients treated with first line IO and for whom we will have major pathologic response (MPR) as primary endpoint. In addition, we will establish the biological underpinnings of these predictive radiomic signatures by evaluating their association with the morphology, immune landscape (from biopsies) and molecular pathways of the tumor. In addition we have access to N>700 NSCLC patients treated on completed clinical trials via our industry partners (Astrazeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb) for tool validation. Finally, we will deploy LunIOTx within the ECOG-5163 (INSIGNA) trial (N>600), the first time that radiomics will be evaluated within a prospective cooperative group clinical trial for IO. RELEVANCE: Only 1 in 5 lung cancer patients treated with immunotherapy (IO) has a favorable response. Additionally, the cost of IO is extremely high, >$200K/year per patient. The goal of this project is to develop novel computational radiomic tools which in conjunction with routine CT scans from IO clinical trials will allow for (1) identifying pre-IO therapy as to which non-small cell lung cancer patients could potentially benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors and (2) quantitatively monitor serial changes in tumor heterogeneity during IO treatment for early identification of responders and non-responders.",Novel Radiomics for Predicting Response to Immunotherapy for Lung Cancer,10233147,R01CA257612,"['Adoption', 'Aftercare', 'Antitumor Response', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease Progression', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inflammatory', 'Institution', 'Letters', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nivolumab', 'Nodule', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nonmetastatic', 'Outcome', 'PD-1/PD-L1', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Resected', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anti-PD-1', 'anti-PD-1/PD-L1', 'anti-PD-L1 therapy', 'base', 'cost', 'imaging biomarker', 'immunotherapy clinical trials', 'immunotherapy trials', 'industry partner', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'phase III trial', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'primary endpoint', 'prognostic', 'prognostic of survival', 'prognostic value', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'success', 'survival outcome', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,619994
"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism. As such, this work promises to improve the detection, treatment and clinical outcomes for CTCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin, whose pathogenesis remains poorly defined. By using multiparametric, high-resolution technologies to characterize the immune and metabolic profiles of the CTCL microenvironment, this work will add mechanistic insight to the underlying pathogenesis and improve the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for CTCL.",Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples,10058252,F32CA233203,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Formalin', 'Glucose', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sirolimus', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Slide', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Suppression', 'Work', 'antibody conjugate', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effector T cell', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mTOR Inhibitor', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nanometer resolution', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'prognostic', 'protein expression', 'skin lesion', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,38571
"Extension to the HTAN Pre-Cancer Atlas Project For many cancer types, the wide-spread adoption of cancer screening has increased the detection of pre-malignant lesions (PML). Despite such efforts, screening has had limited impact on overall survival. Clinical guidelines vary widely from watchful waiting (e.g., prostate) to radical surgery and adjuvant treatment (e.g., breast). In absence of reliable progression risk biomarkers and models, these interventions may have deleterious consequences at the two clinical extremes: delay in life-saving treatment or overtreatment. The study of pre-malignant lesions (PML) at molecular level present significant challenges: PML are small, generally archived in formalin. Moreover, the clinical significance of any identified marker can only be assessed after long follow- up, limiting the translational studies to retrospective collections. These hurdles have prevented the development and application of precision medicine approaches and unbiased biomarker to develop models of progression. The current proposal will extend the MCL Pre-Cancer Atlas Pilot Project (PCAPP initiated in September 2017) with the goal to build multi-modal profiles of highly characterized pre-malignant lesions from the 4 target organs (Lung, Breast, Prostate and Pancreas). The four organs included represent a diverse spectrum of histology - pure histology or mixed with invasive lesions - and clinical settings - treatment or active surveillance. Similarly, the selected profiling methods are as comprehensiveas for invasive tumors atlas (whole transcriptome gene expression or DNA mutations) but also innovative, focusing on micro- environment and exploring spatial heterogeneity (multiplex IHC) and, for a few cases, cellular heterogeneity (single-nuclei sequencing). The propose extension will support the completion of the PCAPP and enable a uniform data analysis and sharing with the community. UCSD Statement of Work The following resources or laboratories will be involved in the work specified in this subcontract. The Oncogenomics Laboratory at Moores Cancer Center: Lead by Dr Harismendy, the Oncogenomics laboratory is located in the Moores Cancer center. Dr Harismendy has established his laboratory to be able to develop molecular assays, sequence in high throughput at the UCSD-IGM core facility and analyzed the results on a compute-cloud compliant with HIPAA regulation. The laboratory includes 1 senior research associate, 3 computational biology students and one programmer. It further contracts with systems and databases administrators located in the division of biomedical informatics or at the San Diego Super Computer Center. The IGM Genomics Center at UCSD: The UCSD IGM Genomics Center offers full services in high throughput sequencing as well as whole-genome genotyping and copy number variation analysis. The IGM Genomics Center offers assay design consultation, sequencing library preparation (DNA/RNA/smallRNA/targeted sequencing), single cell RNA sequencing (10X Genomics), lllumina platform sequencing (MiSeq, HiSeq2500, HiSeq4000 and NovaSeq 6000), and Illumina genotyping and methylation arrays. The UC Davis Center for Genomic Pathology Laboratory provides expert histology and pathology services on a recharge basis. We provide tissue processing/sectioning, routine and special tissue staining, immunohistochemistry, whole slide scanning, database hosting, help with quantitative image analysis and pathology consulting services. Proposed Work: For the budget period we will perform the following work a. PCAPP project management x Continue to organize PCAPP monthly calls: Until December 2020, these calls will be used to keep track on  progress. The goal will be to ensure that data is being generated and shared and to address any logistical  or technical question that may delay progress. In 2021, the focus of the calls will be slowly transitioning to  discuss standardized analysis and present preliminary analysis across teams and organs. x Continue to attend and collaborate with the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN). In particular identify  immediate opportunities for collaboration and data sharing. x Complete the data sharing via JPL LabCAS and dbGaP. Data standardization, upload and registration is a  complex process and every member will need to be assisted to accomplish these goals. b. PCAPP data generation and analysis support x The UCSD IGM genomic center will be contracted to perfrom Exome library preparation and sequencing of  any supplemental DNA samples that need additional coverage or replication x The UCSD team will offer to assist PCAPP teams to analyze and QC their raw data. They will determine  whether the JPL cloud can be used to scale up this analysis and will provide forums and discussion board  for data generator and analyst to discuss the results and suggest novel iterations. x The UC Davis histology core facility will be contracted to perform high resolution scanning, cell counting  and analysis of the multiplex immuno-histochemistry data from the other PCAPP teams. c. Pan-PCAPP analysis, data enrichment and integration Unified data processing: The raw sequencing data (RNA and DNA) from all PCAPP teams will be re-processed at once to generate a uniform call of gene expression, mutations and copy number aberrations. Similarly, the multiplex IHC primary analysis results will be aggregated and processed at once to ensure that no team or organ specific technical differences occurs. The results of the Pan-PCAPP unified analysis will be made available in dbGaP through a new version of the data. Pan-expression analysis: Mitotic grade, immune-infiltration, presence of necrosis, or lesion morphology (papillary, cribriform, tubular, solid) may reveal commonalities across organs. Each component, or expression state, driving these differences will be annotated via gene set enrichment analysis to understand which biological signal and processes may be responsible Pan-mutational analysis: from a set of known driver genes in cancer we will build the oncomap of driver events (mutations or copy number gains and losses), annotate them for their known, likely or unknown pathogenic consequences and determine how their prevalence differs from the drivers identified in more advanced tumors. Pan-spatial immune analysis; across all PML and organs we will determine the relative number of each cell types in the stroma, defining hot, warm and cold immune states and determine their association with expression states or mutational status, after correcting for organ type. We will contract with Dr. Cambell (UCSF) to calculate the EcoScore for each PML, which will summarize a more context depend micro- environmental status, accounting for the clustering and distance between cells. We will determine whether the EcoScore is associated with specific histological features or epithelial expression states, independently of the overall immune-infiltration. Mutational burden and signature analysis: The mutational load (substitution and copy number) will be calculated for all PMLs and tested for association with expression state and histology features. Similarly for PML with sufficient number of mutations, we will determine the contribution of each of the COSMIC mutational signatures [4] to the mutational load and determine whether the presence of any signature is associated with expression state, histology features, or stromal-immune states. Stromal-Epithelial interactions: we will perform an unsupervised integration of the data to investigate stromal vs epithelial interaction. We will first select and abstract multiple epithelial features derived for RNA and DNA analysis above, such as proliferation, burden, presence of key mutational signature, organ-independent expression state (NMF cluster membership), common mutation drivers. We will then use random forest regression with 5 fold-cross validation to determine which features associate with specific stromal immune features derived from the mIHC experiments: hot / cold stroma, immuno-suppressive, proliferative T-cells, EcoScore, etc.",Extension to the HTAN Pre-Cancer Atlas Project,10269615,U2CCA233254,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Budgets', 'Cancer Center', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Contracts', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Core Facility', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial-Stromal Communication', 'Event', 'Formalin', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene set enrichment analysis', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intervention', 'Invasive Lesion', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Lesion by Morphology', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Logistics', 'Lung', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mitotic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Necrosis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pancreas', 'Papillary', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Patient observation', 'Pilot Projects', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'RNA', 'RNA analysis', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Solid', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Students', 'System', 'T-Cell Proliferation', 'Testing', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tubular formation', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'clinically significant', 'computer center', 'computerized data processing', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'design', 'driver mutation', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'member', 'multimodality', 'mutational status', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'precision medicine', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'quantitative imaging', 'random forest', 'scale up', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'targeted sequencing', 'tissue processing', 'transcriptome', 'translational study', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,U2C,2021,304550
"FAST-FNA immune cell profiling in HNSCC Currently, the single best predictive biomarker of response to anti-PD1 monotherapy is PD-L1 expression as assessed by immunohistochemical staining of archived or fresh tissue. Current workflows for PD-L1 assessment in tissue are labor and time consuming, are not infallible (inconclusive results in a fraction of image guided biopsies) and are associated with morbidity and are thus rarely performed serially. Rapid on site assessment of cellular, rather than tissue, specimens obtained through fine needle aspiration (FNA) could not only circumvent these bottlenecks but also enable more comprehensive and serial profiling of the tumor microenvironment to obtain the most up-to-date information of a rapidly changing microenvironment during tumor evolution and therapy. The goal of this project is to further develop and validate the new FAST-FNA technology for rapid biomarker discovery and validation in HNSCCs. There are two main aims. In aim 1 we will develop and validate existing and new biomarkers in FNA samples of HNSCC patients (n=100). Specifically we will I) develop and validate new predictive immunotherapeutic biomarkers and ii to determine how well the new FAST-FNA scores correlate with the CPS scores of PD-L1. The goal of the second aim is to translate the above FAST-FNA technology to serial FNA analyses in HNSCC patients receiving anti-PD1 immunotherapy (with or without chemotherapy; n=100). FNA sampling will be performed pre- and on-treatment in order to capture changes in the tumor microenvironment. As the HNSCC field shifts toward increased biomarker testing, we find an unmet clinical need to develop advanced cellular diagnostics in HNSCCs, which will facilitate rapid biomarker analysis, guide therapies and provide “real time” assessment of clinical response. Existing analysis of HNSCC cancer tissues obtained by core biopsy is limited in many aspects. We have developed a new immune and cancer cell profiling technology based on cellular immunocycling. Using fine needle aspirates (FNA) rather than more invasive core biopsies, this method allows frequent and serial profiling on the composition of the tumor microenvironment in HNSCC patients undergoing immunotherapy.",FAST-FNA immune cell profiling in HNSCC,10154199,R01CA257623,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments', 'Clinical assessments', 'Consumption', 'Core Biopsy', 'Diagnostic', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Fine needle aspiration biopsy', 'Fresh Tissue', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Human', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Needles', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Quality Control', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sedation procedure', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Harvesting', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker validation', 'cancer cell', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'companion diagnostics', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'therapy outcome', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,670725
"Rational translation of gold nanoparticle mediated radiosensitization tothe clinic The use of high atomic number (Z) elements as radiosensitizers of tumors has been well documented in the literature over the last few decades. In particular, gold nanoparticles (GNPs), typically defined as high-Z gold structures with the longest dimension smaller than 100 nm, have been the subject of active investigation for the same purpose for the past 15 years. Early in vivo demonstration of GNP-mediated radiosensitization (GMR) effect was based on passive accumulation of GNPs within tumors (“passive targeting”). While resulting in a remarkable level of GMR, this approach generally requires clinically less relevant radiation quality (low energy kilovoltage x-rays) and clinically unachievable (without direct injection) gold concentration (up to 7mg gold per gram of tumor). To overcome these difficulties, we have been investigating an alternative approach based on “active targeting” which shows a promising outlook for clinical translation in the near term. This proposal seeks to surmount the remaining challenges associated with our active targeting-based approach before embarking on clinical translation of GMR. Specifically, we aim to identify the molecular mechanism of GMR, biodistribution and kinetics of GNPs developed for clinical translation, their fate at the tumor and cellular levels, and the correlation between GNP-mediated dose enhancement and GMR. Despite abundant data and publications on GMR accumulated over the years, critical knowledge gaps still exist in terms of the aforementioned aspects, hindering clinical translation of GMR. As demonstrated in our preliminary data, we propose to address such issues that hold the key for clinical translation of GMR, through concerted multidisciplinary efforts. Upon achieving this goal, a pilot human trial of GNP-enhanced radiation therapy (RT) will also be conducted within this project for the management of recurrent rectal cancer. Overall, we will pursue three Specific Aims shown below to achieve the goals of this project. (1) To determine the molecular mechanism of GMR, the biodistribution/kinetics of GNPs in vitro and in vivo, and the radiosensitization efficacy in clinically relevant treatment scenarios, (2) To correlate GNP-mediated dose enhancement and GMR using high resolution image-based cell/tissue models and nanoscale computational techniques, and (3) To conduct a pilot human trial of GNP-enhanced RT for previously radiated recurrent rectal cancers. Ultimately, this project would lay the foundation for widespread applications of the currently envisioned RT paradigm that enables more potent and tumor-specific RT with less toxicity. Increasing the radiation dose delivered to rectal cancers treated preoperatively can improve pathological response at the time of surgery and possibly even obviate the need for surgery but this has been challenging to implement in the clinic due to the limited radiation tolerance of the surrounding normal intestinal loops. Gold nanoparticles that preferentially accumulate in tumors offer the possibility to increase radiation dose within the tumor without damaging adjacent normal tissues. To amplify this radiation dose enhancement, we propose to advance clinical translation of a paradigm using gold nanoparticles that home to the tumor, get internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, disperse in the cytoplasm via co-administered pharmacological agents, and can be modeled by mathematical techniques that predict the biological consequences of tumor accumulation.",Rational translation of gold nanoparticle mediated radiosensitization tothe clinic,10144062,R01CA257241,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biodistribution', 'Biological', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Cytoplasm', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Double Strand Break Repair', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High-LET Radiation', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Injections', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Mediating', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nanotechnology', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmacology', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Radiosensitization', 'Rectal Cancer', 'Recurrence', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transmission Electron Microscopy', 'Tumor Tissue', 'base', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'dosage', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'ionization', 'irradiation', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoGold', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'radiation response', 'receptor internalization', 'receptor mediated endocytosis', 'response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R01,2021,631688
"Network mechanisms and bioengineering of precision immunotherapies for glioblastomas Project Summary/Abstract Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal malignancy of the human central nervous system (CNS). This devastating disease has a median overall survival of 3 months from time of diagnosis in untreated patients. Despite the significant cost and morbidity with standard of care surgical resection combined with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation, life expectancy is only extended by a few months. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are a class of immunotherapies with an FDA-approved treatment for solid tumors. These work by directly lysing tumor cells, which then release tumor antigens with danger signals that elicit antitumor immunity. Adenovirus is a strong candidate OV immunotherapy for GBM because of its low neurotoxicity when delivered by intratumoral injection and its amenability to bioengineering. Ad5-Δ24, an adenovirus modified to replicate in GBM but not in other CNS cells, is perhaps the most promising OV in clinical trials. Major hurdles remain, however, including innate immunoresistance. This study will overcome these by elucidating complex tumor-OV interaction mechanisms at the systems level, designing and constructing improved OV candidates that exploit these mechanisms, and then validating the mechanisms by experimentally testing the OVs. Preliminary studies for this proposal demonstrate that GBM patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have distinct transcriptomes in vivo and can be cultured as neurospheres (Sp-GBMs) under serum-free conditions ex vivo. Ad5-Δ24 OV can lyse several different Sp-GBMs ex vivo and the level of this oncolytic activity is PDX specific. Additionally, preliminary in silico models suggest that such OV activity levels are contextually dependent on protein-protein interaction networks in the target GBM cells. This project will test the central hypothesis that dynamic transcriptional states of human GBM play key mechanistic roles in Ad5-Δ24 oncolytic efficacy; therefore, modeling the emergent system behaviors will guide the engineering of precision OV immunotherapies. The first aim will classify human GBM PDXs using transcriptomes to predict Ad5-Δ24 OV responses and identify context-specific network features. The resulting classifier and network models will be validated by assessing their ability to predict the response of Sp-GBM to Ad5-Δ24 OV treatment. The second aim will elucidate Ad5- Δ24 OV gene dependencies and resistance mechanisms in human GBM PDXs. Predictions from both aims will both experimentally and computationally validated. Synthetic Ad5-Δ24 OVs with shRNAs that perturb these gene dependencies and resistance mechanisms will be constructed and tested for efficacy. These precisely targeted alterations result in the quantifiable, predictable phenotypic effects of modulating human GBM gene expression and oncolysis ex vivo and in vivo. Such synthetic OVs will be useful as GBM research tools. As a future direction, the big data generated will be a valuable public resource to further interrogate antitumor immunity and inflammation states. Successful completion of these aims will yield novel GBM diagnostic subtypes with paired engineered OVs ready for preclinical development as precision immunotherapies. Project Narrative Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common lethal brain tumor. This research aims to develop a novel immunotherapy using engineered viruses to treat this tumor with minimal side effects. The results from this study will also provide mechanistic insight into the disease and guide future clinical trials to treat this tumor.",Network mechanisms and bioengineering of precision immunotherapies for glioblastomas,10231604,F30CA250122,"['Adenoviruses', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Astrocytes', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glioblastoma', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inflammation', 'Injections', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferons', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neuraxis', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Serotyping', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'efficacy testing', 'immune resistance', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'multiple omics', 'neoplastic cell', 'network models', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'oncolysis', 'oncolytic adenovirus', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'preclinical development', 'predicting response', 'protein protein interaction', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'retinoblastoma tumor suppressor', 'side effect', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'small hairpin RNA', 'standard of care', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis', 'viral resistance']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,F30,2021,46236
"Creating a foundation for personalized age- and sex-based immune-targeted therapies from an ALS longitudinal cohort by identifying peripheral and central immune signatures ABSTRACT The immune system contributes to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) progression and survival, and therapies to target the immune system are of burgeoning interest. However, the changes in the immune system during the course of ALS and the sex-specific alterations in immune function warrant a more in depth analysis in order to develop personalized ALS therapies and biomarkers. The long-term goals are to harness the immune sys- tem’s potential to slow and stop the progression of ALS. The overall objective is to determine how peripheral immune profiles, sex, age, and sex hormones, link to neuronal damage, neuroinflammation, and ALS progres- sion and survival. The central hypothesis is that peripheral immune profiles are an important pathophysiologic agent of ALS progression and survival; that sex, age and sex hormone levels impact these profiles; and that insight into ALS patient-specific immune profiles will yield new drug targets and therapeutic windows. Our ra- tionale is that linking patient-specific immune cell profiles to ALS progression and survival will facilitate person- alized immunomodulatory therapeutic development for ALS and identify potential treatment windows. The cen- tral hypothesis will be pursued with three aims: 1) Identify specific immune profiles that associate with ALS pro- gression and survival rates.; 2) Evaluate the effects of sex hormones on ALS immune profiles, progression, and survival; and 3) Identify immune profiles and corresponding cellular pathways that are most toxic to neu- rons and that associate with central inflammation. In Aim 1 longitudinal immunophenotyping of peripheral blood samples from ALS subjects will generate composite immune profiles that will then be linked to ALS subject characteristics, progression, and survival. Aim 2 will determine if observed sex-dependent associations be- tween immune profiles and ALS progression and survival are mediated by sex hormones, as sex hormones can alter immune profiles. Aim 3 will enrich a cohort of ALS subjects by immune profile clusters; their periph- eral immune populations will be analyzed using 1) RNA-seq and 2) cell toxicity studies via co-cultures with iPSC-derived neurons; subjects will also have positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to quantify central neuroinflammation. Datasets will be synthesized to build prediction models and create deep neural networks capable of associating immune profiles with sex, age, disease severity, progression, and survival The research proposed is innovative, in the applicants’ opinion, because it rigorously examines the effects of sex, age, and sex hormone levels on immune cells and ALS progression and survival in a longitudinal study. It also accounts for the interactions between immune cells by forming immune profiles for individual subjects and assesses how specific profiles associate with dysregulated pathways, cytotoxicity, and neuroinflammation. The proposed re- search is significant because it will provide critical data on the distinct immune profiles and pathways associ- ated with ALS progression and survival in a sex-, age- and sex hormone- specific fashion. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on identifying the alterations in the im- mune system that impact amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and also focuses on identifying whether these altered immune profiles are influenced by sex- and age-specific factors. The development of such strategies will greatly advance the ability to develop personalized treatment approaches for persons with ALS based on immunomodulatory drugs. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to part of the NIH’s mission that pertains to developing the fundamental knowledge about the nervous system and using that knowledge to reduce the bur- den of neurological disease.",Creating a foundation for personalized age- and sex-based immune-targeted therapies from an ALS longitudinal cohort by identifying peripheral and central immune signatures,10177640,R01NS120926,"['ALS patients', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Estrogens', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Mediating', 'Michigan', 'Mission', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostitution', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tweens', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis therapy', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'cytotoxicity', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug repurposing', 'effective therapy', 'immune function', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotoxicity', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'predictive modeling', 'sex', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,643473
"Systems-level identification of key regulators deciding immune cell state Abstract Understanding the mechanisms and identifying regulators of immune cell development and differentiation are critical for developing new and more effective therapeutics. The fast advancement of genomic technologies provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the immune cells at the system level. The noise in the high throughput measurements and the complexity of multiple omics data make it an urgent need for developing novel and powerful systems biology approach for integrative analysis to reveal the underlying regulatory mechanisms for immune system. We propose a new method to integrate multiomics data at the genetic network level for identification of key regulators deciding the cell state and cell fate (Specific Aim 1). We will apply the method to systematically uncover the regulatory mechanisms in the mouse immune system by analyzing 86 immune cell populations (Specific Aim 2). We will also perform comparative analysis of the human and mouse immune cells to reveal the conserved regulatory code for immune cell specification (Specific Aim 3). We will rigorously assess the performance of the computational analysis, experimentally confirm the importance of the identified key regulators and investigate their roles in regulating immune cell functions. Once complete, the proposed work will provide not only a general tool for integrative analysis of multiomics data but also specific mechanistic insights for understanding the regulation of immune system functions.

"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut.

"Comprehensive characterization of the cancer microbiome and its immuno-oncology interface Project Summary/Abstract  Cancer has long been described as a disease of the human genome, and the past two decades of research have largely focused on characterizing the molecular mechanisms that contribute to its origin, progression, and treatment resistance.1,2,28–30 Over the past year, a series of seminal studies have identified significant non-human, microbial contributions in the development and advancement of solid tumors, hematologic malignancies, and germline cancer syndromes, as well as the variable efficacy of chemo- and immunotherapy, shedding light on what may be considered cancer’s ‘second’ genome (the metagenome).3–11,25 The extent of these microbial contributions across diverse cancer types in the human body and their implications on broader clinical management, however, remain largely unknown.12 Answering basic questions regarding the presence and specificity of such microbes in certain cancer types and cancer stages could guide the rational design of new, microbially-based diagnostics, prognostics, and therapies. Further, addressing more complex questions regarding the interactions of these microbes with cancer and host immune cells in the tumor microenvironment could provide critical insight into the design of personalized immunotherapy, cancer vaccines, and cancer risk profiles, hopefully leading to improved patient outcomes.  This proposal builds on a recent analysis of the cancer microbiome in 14,038 primary tumors, through which I have shown that virtually every major tumor type in the human body carries a unique, discriminative microbial signature. Inspired by recent evidence that highlights the role of pathogen-centric immunobiology in cancer development16,17 and the ability of microbes to powerfully modulate the systemic and local immune systems,5,6,8,18 I now hypothesize that the broad existence of these cancer microbes provides an evolutionary advantage for tumors to escape the host immune system’s recognition and response. I also hypothesize that the same immunological processes that are known to shape cancer’s mutational and phenotypic landscapes are concurrently shaping the tumor microbiota. Armed with patient germline HLA allele data and inferred immune cell abundances in the same primary tumors as those in our cancer microbiome study, I believe these hypotheses are finally testable. Aim 1 of this project seeks to investigate them alongside immunotherapy response data.21,22 Complementarily, Aim 2 seeks to define the intratumoral spatial distribution of the cancer microbiome and associated immune cells using a combination of computational and wet lab analyses. These results will contribute to our foundational knowledge on what is becoming the immuno-oncology-microbiome (IOM) axis.  The proposed interdisciplinary research will take place at UC San Diego in collaboration with microbiome, systems biology, tumor immunology, pathology, and oncology experts, who serve as mentors and advisors to me. Through their invaluable mentorship, hands-on learning, networking, and additional graduate coursework, I will grow into the translational and effective physician-scientist I so desire to be. Project Narrative The long-held view that cancer is a “sterile” entity is starting to change. New evidence suggests that intratumoral microbes can affect the development, progression, and treatment resistance of solid tumors. My preliminary findings suggest that unique microbial signatures exist for every major tumor type in the human body, and this proposal extends that work to characterize the interfaces between these cancer microbes, cancer cells, and the host immune system.",Comprehensive characterization of the cancer microbiome and its immuno-oncology interface,10112096,F30CA243480,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Alleles', 'Binding', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future Generations', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunologics', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metadata', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Oxygen', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Sterility', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer cell', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'carcinogenesis', 'design', 'digital', 'enteric infection', 'genome sequencing', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'hands-on learning', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning network', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'pathogen', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'prognostic', 'response', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microbiota', 'tumor microenvironment', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F30,2021,38109
"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic approach to treat cancer.",Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors,10180915,R01CA229818,"['Abscopal effect', 'Address', 'Agonist', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Dendritic cell activation', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Adjuvants', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Injections', 'Innate Immune System', 'Interferons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Newcastle disease virus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stimulator of Interferon Genes', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Activation', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'analog', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'antitumor agent', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical development', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'lead optimization', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'next generation', 'novel', 'response', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2021,714132
"COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT IMMUNOGLOBULIN SEQUENCING EXPERIMENTS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ability of our immune system to respond effectively to pathogenic challenge or vaccination depends on a diverse repertoire of Immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors expressed by B lymphocytes. Each B cell receptor (BCR) is unique, having been assembled during lymphocyte development by recombination of germline encoded V(D)J genes. During the course of an immune response, B cells that initially bind antigen with low affinity through their BCR are modified through cycles of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and affinity-dependent selection to produce high-affinity memory and plasma cells. This affinity maturation is a critical component of T cell dependent adaptive immune responses. It helps guard against rapidly mutating pathogens and underlies the basis for many vaccines, but dysregulation can result in autoimmunity and other diseases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized our ability to carry out large-scale adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) experiments. AIRR-Seq is increasingly being applied to profile BCR repertoires and gain insights into immune responses in healthy individuals and those with a range of diseases, including autoimmunity, infection, allergy, cancer and aging. As NGS technologies improve, these experiments are producing ever larger datasets, with tens- to hundreds-of-millions of BCR sequences. Although promising, repertoire-scale data present fundamental challenges for analysis requiring the development of new techniques and the rethinking of existing methods that are not scalable to the large number of sequences being generated. This proposal describes the development of a series of novel computational methods to explore the central hypothesis that: B cell clonal relationships and lineage structures can be computationally derived from repertoire sequencing data and used to define B cell migration and differentiation networks in health and disease. Specifically, computational methods will be developed to: (Aim 1) identify clonally-related sequences and improve V(D)J gene assignment through determining the Ig locus haplotype, (Aim 2) reconstruct clonal lineages, and use these to learn B cell migration and differentiation networks, and (Aim 3) analyze sequences to predict repertoire properties and sequence motifs that are associated with antigen binding or clinically-relevant outcomes. These through human a combination of simulation-based studies, as (myasthenia gravis) and murine (endogenous methods will be validated well as testing on new experimental data from both retrovirus emergence) systems. Allmethods will be integrated and made available through our widely-used, open-source Immcantation framework, which provides a start-to-finish analytical ecosystem for AIRR-Seq analysis. Together, these methods provide a window into the micro-evolutionary dynamics that drive adaptive immunity and the dysregulation that occurs in disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop and validate computational methods to analyze large-scale adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) data sets that have become possible with the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies. The methods development will enable the extraction of new types of information, including immunoglobulin locus haplotypes, as well as B cell migration and differentiation networks. Through quantitative characterization of B cell immunoglobulin repertoires, these methods will provide insights into the micro-evolutionary dynamics that drive adaptive immune responses to infection and vaccination, and the dysregulation that occurs in diseases like autoimmunity.",COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT IMMUNOGLOBULIN SEQUENCING EXPERIMENTS,10075214,R01AI104739,"['Affinity', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'B-Cell Receptor Binding', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Clone Cells', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA receptor', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dengue', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Ecosystem', 'Endogenous Retroviruses', 'Epitopes', 'Event', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Graph', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Invaded', 'Laplacian', 'Learning', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Myasthenia Gravis', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Plasma Cells', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retroviridae', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thymectomy', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Virus', 'adaptive immune response', 'adaptive immunity', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'high throughput analysis', 'immunoglobulin receptor', 'immunological status', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'method development', 'migration', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'reconstruction', 'relapse prediction', 'response', 'simulation']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,416371
"Gut Microbial and Metabolic Mediators of Rotavirus Vaccine Response Abstract Rotavirus (RV) infection causes life-threatening, dehydrating diarrhea and is the leading cause of diarrheal deaths among children <5 years old despite availability of a vaccine. Critically, the oral vaccine is less effective in middle- and low-income countries where disproportionately more deaths occur compared to high-income countries. Addressing this disparity in vaccine effectiveness is a major public health priority. Correlates of protection do not exist, and cellular responses against RV in humans remain incompletely understood. Mounting evidence supports a direct role for the gut microbiota in modulating humoral and cellular immune responses to oral vaccines, but little is known about their actual mechanism of action. In our pilot study, vaccine responders had a significantly greater abundance of Bifidobacterium longum and higher content of microbial genes associated with folate transformation in their gut compared to nonresponders. These data suggest that infants may depend on microbes such as B. longum to synthesize folate de novo as a mechanism for RV-specific immune cell expansion. We hypothesize that de novo folate synthesis by microbes such as B. longum facilitates RV-specific immune cell expansion, and that levels of folate modulate vaccine immunogenicity. We propose to study 330 infants from the US, Panama, and Peru where vaccine efficacy is known to be high, medium and low, respectively, by using both stored and prospectively collected longitudinal samples of blood and stool from infants 0 to 12 months of age. We have designed a novel RV “megapool” of immunogenic peptides to define cellular immune responses to RV vaccination in addition to assessing traditional serum RV-specific IgA and stool RV shedding after immunization (Aim 1). We will characterize gut microbial composition and function using metagenomic sequencing at multiple pre-vaccination time points in vaccine responders and nonresponders to determine if the abundance of B. longum and capacity to synthesize folate predict vaccine immunogenicity (Aim 2). We will analyze the metabolic byproducts to identify if folate or other metabolites enhance vaccine response (Aim 3). Our unique team of experts in vaccinology, immunology, microbiology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics will ensure successful integrative analysis and interpretation of these immunologic and multi-omics data. Completion of the study will provide a comprehensive characterization of microbial and metabolic biomarkers of RV vaccine responses, paving the way for targeted immune augmentation strategies. Project Narrative Rotavirus vaccine was developed to prevent severe diarrhea and is especially important in low- and middle- income countries where 85% of deaths due to rotaviruses occur; unfortunately, vaccine efficacy is lower in these countries compared to high-income countries. This proposal will study infants from three countries with different socioeconomic levels and use sophisticated methods to determine how specific bacteria in the infant gut (microbiome) may change the response to the vaccine. If successful, this study will have a significant impact on this important public health disparity as a targeted intervention to improve vaccine response, even if small, could save tens of thousands of lives every year.",Gut Microbial and Metabolic Mediators of Rotavirus Vaccine Response,10176257,R01HD100542,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Age-Months', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody titer measurement', 'Bacteria', 'Bifidobacterium', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Country', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diarrhea', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Feces', 'Folic Acid', 'Folic Acid Deficiency', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Biotransformation', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nutrient', 'Oral', 'Panama', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Peru', 'Peruvian', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Role', 'Rotavirus', 'Rotavirus Infections', 'Rotavirus Vaccines', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Cell Proliferation', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Vitamins', 'base', 'cell growth', 'design', 'folic acid supplementation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'health disparity', 'immune function', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'infant gut microbiome', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'oral vaccine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health priorities', 'response', 'sample collection', 'socioeconomics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'stool sample', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccinology']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,644656
"Do Tumor-Immune Interactions Prime Systemic Tolerance of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Brain Metastases? PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY It is widely estimated that 90% of cancer-related deaths are caused by metastasis. This statistic underscores our inability to manage cancer once it disseminates through the body, and our need to better understand the molecular mechanisms that drive metastasis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer that occurs in 10-20% of cases. Taken as a group, TNBCs pose an unmet clinical challenge in many ways: (1) TNBCs represents the most aggressive and most metastatic subtype of breast cancer, (2) up to 46% of late-stage TNBC patients will develop brain metastases, (3) TNBC patients are at four-times higher risk of developing diffuse metastases on the surface of the brain (leptomeningeal disease), which is rapidly and universally fatal, and 4) women of African ancestry have an up to 80% higher likelihood of developing TNBC – making TNBC a cancer disparity. Previous studies demonstrate that primary TNBC is highly immunogenic, and immune infiltration is associated with improved prognosis. However, little is known about the immune environment in TNBC brain metastases and how tumor-immune interactions effect metastatic potential. Recognizing these pressing issues, I have chosen to focus my career as an independent cancer researcher on using a systems biology approach to uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie metastasis and race- specific cancer disparities. A comprehensive mentoring, research, and career development plan will be executed over the course of the K99 and R00 training period, which will provide me with the necessary tools to make an early transition to independence. First, to visualize tumor-immune interactions, I will construct an in-situ protein map of TNBC brain metastases using MIBI – a cutting-edge multiplexed imaging method (AIM 1). I will use a validated imaging analysis pipeline to quantitate the composition and spatial architecture of the tumor-immune microenvironment and determine the extent to which these features correlate with patient outcomes. In AIM 2, I will identify tumor-immune receptor-ligand pairs using single-cell RNA-sequencing on TNBC brain metastases samples. Lastly, in AIM 3, I will use MIBI to visualize tumor-immune interactions in primary TNBCs to determine whether interactions in the primary tumor microenvironment prime immune system tolerance of disseminated tumor cells enabling brain metastases. I will validate relevant targets by measuring their expression in patient cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), which contains brain-tumor- associated cell-free RNA. The results of my proposed postdoctoral research will positively impact public health as they will reveal key tumor-immune interactions responsible for priming the immune system for metastasis, and will generate the first “TNBC brain metastasis interactome”. My results will lead to the discovery of new molecular targets with the primary goal of reducing metastasis-driven cancer mortality. The K99 career development plan and focused research training will be critical to expand my skillset in biocomputation – a necessary component of my proposed research; as well as fill any gaps in my background, preparing me for a timely and successful transition to the R00 independent phase. Overall, the dual-phase award will significantly enhance my research, and ensure my continued contribution to public health and increasing diversity in science, as an established cancer researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE It is estimated that metastasis is responsible for 90% of cancer deaths, with 1 in every 2 advanced staged triple-negative breast cancer patients developing brain metastases – surviving as little as 4.9 months after metastatic diagnosis. This work postulates that the spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment reflects distinct tumor-immune interactions that are driven by receptor-ligand pairing; and that these interactions not only impact tumor progression in the brain, but also prime the immune system (early on) to be tolerant of disseminated cancer cells permitting brain metastases.

"T cell mechanisms of immunotherapy response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Project Summary Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) provide durable clinical responses in about 20% of cancer patients, but have been largely ineffective for non-immunogenic cancers that lack intratumoral T cells. Most tumors have somatic mu- tations that encode for mutant proteins that are tumor-speciﬁc and not expressed on normal cells (termed neoanti- gens). Cancers, such as melanoma, with the highest mutational burdens are more likely to respond to single agent ICIs. However, most cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), have lower mutational loads, resulting in fewer T cells inﬁltrating the tumor. Studies have previously demonstrated that an allogeneic GM-CSF- based vaccine enhances T cell inﬁltration into human pancreatic cancer. Recent work with Panc02 cells, which express around 60 neoantigens similar to human PDAC, showed that PancVAX, a neoantigen-targeted vaccine, when paired with immune modulators cleared tumors in Panc02-bearing mice. This data suggests that cancer vaccines targeting tumor neoantigens induce neoepitope-speciﬁc T cells, which can be further activated by ICIs, leading to tumor rejection. Currently the impact of such treatment on T cell expression states and the underly- ing mechanism of therapeutic response remains poorly deﬁned. Comprehensive characterization of responding T cells will be critical in understanding mechanisms of response and providing rationale for combinatorial therapy. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that when used alongside neoantigen-targeted vaccines, individual ICIs have distinct as well as synergistic modes of action and that different treatment combinations result in distinct changes in the T cell repertoire related to immunotherapy response. To address this hypothesis, I propose two speciﬁc aims. Aim 1: To characterize the transcriptional changes in T cells during immunotherapy treatment. I will ﬁrst investigate the effect of PancVAX, with and without addition of ICIs, on gene expression at a single-cell level in the Panc02 mouse model. Then I will determine biological processes driving differences in anti-tumor response between treatment arms. I will experimenally validate these differences using ﬂow cytometry. Aim 2: To develop trajectory building methods depicting the clonal evolution of T cells. We will apply this method to T cell receptor sequencing data from human clinical trials of PDAC treated with vaccine and ICI to identify key changes within the T cell repertoire associated with tumor regression or resistance. Successful completion of these aims will inform future combination immunotherapy approaches in PDAC patients and provide new open-source computational software to characterize T cell populations that can be applied to diverse cancer types. The skills I will acquire as I complete this research will prepare me for a career as an interdisciplinary scientist, characterizing the tumor immune landscape to inform precision immunotherapy. Project Narrative Immunotherapy has been largely unsuccessful in pancreatic cancer. However, vaccines can convert these oth- erwise immunologically insensitive tumors into those that respond to agents called immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This project aims to better understand the mechanism of response when vaccines against tumor-speciﬁc antigens are combined with ICIs.",T cell mechanisms of immunotherapy response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma,10139211,F31CA250135,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Allogenic', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Combination immunotherapy', 'Combined Vaccines', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease regression', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Grant', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'T cell clonality', 'T cell receptor repertoire sequencing', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trees', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'anti-tumor immune response', 'base', 'cancer type', 'career', 'combinatorial', 'effector T cell', 'exhaustion', 'human data', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'neoantigen vaccine', 'neoantigens', 'open source', 'pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'prevent', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'success', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036
"Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer ABSTRACT Colon cancer (CC) is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. While the TCGA data has implicated numerous molecular aberrations in cancer etiology and mechanisms, a direct link between genomic events and patient outcomes is lacking. While the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system is widely utilized and provides prognostic information, CCs show considerable stage-independent variability in outcome indicating that more robust classifiers are needed for prognostic stratification. Prognostic information is critical to guide patient management and surveillance after cancer resection and can inform treatment selection. Using only gene expression data, we identified four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) of CC with distinct prognoses. We hypothesize that inclusion of additional genomic features will enable more granular molecular subtyping by identifying additional molecular patterns. Toward this objective (Aim 1), we will utilize multi-omics data sets generated from two completed phase III adjuvant chemotherapy trials in CC (NCCTG N0147, NSAPB C-08). We will also develop a supervised prognostic model by integrating comprehensive molecular data with clinicopathological variables and outcome data (Aim 2). Our unique resource for supervised learning is the high-quality survival data from the clinical trial cohorts. We hypothesize that integration of genomic alterations within clinically relevant genes and gene expression levels with clinicopathological variables can improve the prediction of recurrence/survival compared to traditional TNM staging alone. We will include in a step-wise fashion in our training models selected genes and miRNA expression, somatic mutations, minor allele frequencies, somatic copy number alterations as well as CMS and clinical features, to optimize predictive performance. Given that immune and stromal infiltrating cells are well recognized as determinants of prognosis in CC, we propose to characterize tumor immune and stromal markers among distinct CC molecular subtypes and determine their contribution to prognosis (Aim 3). Specifically, we will characterize these transcriptomic markers computationally, and determine whether they can refine molecular subtypes and improve prognostic modeling. Our proposal represents the first comprehensive prediction of CC patient survival using features from both genomic and transcriptomic alterations that will be integrated with immune and stromal markers using state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches. The impact of this work is substantial in that it will identify determinants of recurrence at the molecular pathway level or in the tumor microenvironment, which will help prioritize targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the outcome of this grant is expected to have practice-changing implications that can further advance the field of precision oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The survival of colon cancer patients varies considerably within the same tumor stage indicating the need for better predictors of outcome. We will use tumor molecular profiling data from clinical trial cohorts to identify subgroups of patients that show differences in outcome and then develop a model that includes both molecular and clinical data to predict survival. This information is critical for determining patient treatment and follow-up approaches that may be practice-changing.",Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer,10070579,R01CA210509,"['Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'BRAF gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal', 'Consensus', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Immune', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infiltration', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'North Central Cancer Treatment Group', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'Stratification', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Invasion', 'Supervision', 'TNM', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor stage', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'differential expression', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'molecular subtypes', 'multiple omics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'supervised learning', 'survival prediction', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,407754
"Integrative Functional Profiling of Tumor-Derived Extracellular Vesicles PROJECT SUMMARY Clinical implementation of Precision Medicine faces major challenges in precision disease stratification and staging, determining optimal treatment, monitoring therapy response, and overcoming drug resistance and relapse. To address these challenges, there is a critical unmet need for better biomarkers and tests that complement current methods for accurate diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of response to treatments. Liquid biopsy presents an innovative non-invasive modality for precision oncology as it promises to provide a global view of tumor dynamics. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, are emerging as a new paradigm of liquid biopsy for non-invasive cancer diagnosis and monitoring. Exosomes are 40-150 nm membrane vesicles secreted by most cells and have been identified as essential mediators of cell interactions and signaling that promote tumor metastasis, drug resistance, and relapse. Despite the potential clinical impact of these findings, precise biological functions of exosomes, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-mediated modulation of tumor microenvironments, and their potential clinical value remain yet to be determined. This is due in part to the daunting challenges in isolation and analysis of these nanovesicles with diverse molecular and functional properties. Here we hypothesize that functional phenotypes of circulating exosomes can provide potent biomarkers for detecting early malignancy, monitoring tumor progression and metastasis, and assessing therapy response in breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, we propose the advanced development and validation of a nano-engineered microfluidic biosensing system capable of integrative analysis of both molecular and functional phenotypes of exosomes in one streamlined workflow. The research will be performed by three specific aims: 1) Expand the MINDS strategy to develop an optimal 3D nano-engineered integrative EV molecular and activity profiling (EV-MAP) nanochip platform; 2) Adapt and optimize the EV-MAP technology for monitoring tumor burden and therapy response using mouse models; and 3) Evaluate and validate the EV-MAP technology for potential applications to clinical diagnosis and classification of breast cancer patients. The new technology will confer superior analytical capabilities to substantially accelerate the functional studies of circulating exosomes. Harnessing exosome activities for diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic benefit presents a paradigm-shifting mechanism for precision medicine. While focused on breast cancer in this project, our research will ultimately create a transformative tool for studies of a wide range of bioactive exosomes in various malignancies to develop reliable non-invasive liquid biopsy of cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE The lack of reliable non-invasive blood biomarkers presents a serious obstacle to the personalized management and treatment of cancer, more importantly, metastatic and recurrent disease. Our proposal aims to develop new tools to investigate circulating exosomes as a new paradigm of liquid biopsy in solid tumors. New non-invasive exosomal biomarkers and tests could profoundly impact the clinical strategies to monitor disease status and treatment and in post-therapy follow-up, to detect early disease recurrence.",Integrative Functional Profiling of Tumor-Derived Extracellular Vesicles,10190320,R33CA252158,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer cell line', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Disease stratification', 'Drug resistance', 'Engineering', 'Epithelial', 'Evolution', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Face', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Goals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'MMP14 gene', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Mesenchymal', 'Metastatic/Recurrent', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nanochip Analytical Device', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Validation', 'Vesicle', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cancer diagnosis', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug relapse', 'exosome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'liquid biopsy', 'lithography', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'microfluidic technology', 'mouse model', 'nanoengineering', 'nanopattern', 'nanovesicle', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'patient stratification', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized management', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'prognostic', 'protein expression', 'prototype', 'response', 'self assembly', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'validation studies']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R33,2021,354506
"Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors Project Summary Scientific understanding of adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) has the potential to revolutionize prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. High‐throughput DNA sequencing and functional experiments have now brought the study of adaptive immune receptors into the big‐data era. To realize this potential of these data they must be matched with appropriately powerful analytical techniques. Existing probabilistic and mechanistic models are insufficient to capture the complexities of these data, while a naïve application of machine learning cannot leverage our profound existing knowledge of the immune system. The goal of this project is to blend deep learning with mechanistic modeling in order to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors. Aim 1: Develop generative models of immune receptor sequences that capture the complexity of real adaptive immune receptor repertoires. These will combine deep learning along with our knowledge of VDJ recombination, and provide a rigorous platform for detailed repertoire comparison. Aim 2: Develop quantitative mechanistic models of antibody somatic hypermutation that incorporate the underlying biochemical processes. Estimate intractable likelihoods using deep learning to infer important latent variables, and validate models using knock‐out experiments in cell lines. Aim 3: Develop hybrid deep learning models to predict binding properties from sequence data, combining large experimentally‐derived binding data with even larger sets of immune sequences from human immune memory samples. Incorporate structural information via 3D convolution or distance‐based penalties. These tools will reveal the full power of immune repertoire data for medical applications. We will obtain more rigorous comparisons of repertoires via their distribution in a relevant space. These will reveal the effects of immune perturbations such as vaccination and disease, allowing us to pick out sequences that are impacted by these perturbations. We will have a greater quantitative understanding of somatic hypermutation in vivo, and statistical models that appropriately capture long‐range effects of collections of mutations. We will also have algorithms that will be able to combine repertoire data and sparse binding data to predict binding properties. Put together, these advances will enable rational vaccine design, treatment for autoimmune disease, and identification of T cells that are promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Project Narrative Adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) enable our body to fight off disease, “remember” pathogens, and train the immune system through vaccination. Immunologists have learned via high‐throughput sequencing that adaptive immune receptors have a truly remarkable diversity. In this proposal, we develop machine‐learning methods for these sequence data, which will allow us to predict the maturation, statistical distribution, and binding properties of adaptive immune receptors, and thus to better design vaccinations, autoimmune disease treatment, and immunotherapy treatment for cancer.",Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors,10159730,R01AI146028,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'complex data', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'functional group', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'pathogen', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,689648
"New treatment monitoring biomarkers for brain tumors using multiparametric MRI with machine learning Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate novel imaging biomarker(s) that use multiparameter MRI methods to identify the true spatial extent of glial brain tumors. The standard RANO (response assessment in neuro-oncology) criteria define tumor extent as the region of bright signal on post-contrast agent T1w (T1+C) images, termed the contrast enhancing lesion (CEL), along with the peritumoral bright signal on T2w FLAIR images, referred to as non-enhancing lesion (NEL). Yet, the CEL reflects the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to contrast agent and can appear the same for both tumor and treatment effect. Likewise, though NEL likely contains tumor, current imaging cannot distinguish tumor from edema. These difficulties result in the inability of current anatomical MRI methods to determine the true spatial extent of glial tumors, a serious limitation for treatment management of brain tumor patients. We and others have shown that advanced MRI methods, including perfusion and diffusion MRI, are useful for assessing tumor grade, predicting outcomes, or distinguishing tumor from treatment effect. Yet, almost exclusively, the approach has been to extract mean values of a single physiological parameter from predetermined tumor regions of interest and then measure their correlation with the desired clinical index. Although this approach has been useful for initial biomarker development, it underutilizes the rich multiparameter and spatial information available, thus motivating the current study. First, two multiparameter MRI biomarkers will be developed to identify enhancing and infiltrating tumor burden. Then, they will be evaluated individually and in combination to assess the total tumor burden in comparison with the standard volumetric metrics in current use. The development and testing of these biomarkers will be accomplished in several independent steps outlined by the proposed aims. First (Aim 1), we propose to develop an MRI biomarker that gives the voxelwise probability of enhancing tumor burden within CEL, with early results showing the ability to distinguish tumor from treatment effect. Next, we will develop a multiparameter biomarker capable of identifying infiltrating tumor within NEL (Aim 2). These efforts leverage our previous results using artificial intelligence, recent advances in machine learning, and our unique brain tumor tissue bank with hundreds of biopsy samples spatially matched to imaging. Finally (Aim 3), the spatial extent of tumor burden within CEL and NEL will be tested in their ability to distinguish pseudo-progression/response from true progression/response, which is a primary question that confounds treatment management today. In summary, multiparameter advanced MRI biomarkers of enhancing and infiltrative brain tumor have the potential to cause a paradigm shift in how treatment is managed, ultimately resulting in improved outcomes. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel multiparametric MRI biomarkers that precisely identify regions of brain tumor within areas of contrast-enhancement and peritumoral edema, which cannot be identified using standard MRI.

"Integrative Prediction of Therapeutic Response in T-cell Lymphoma by Omic and Spatial Modeling ABSTRACT The tumor ecosystem plays a critical role in tumor development, progression and therapeutic response. Previous studies have utilized dissociative and single-cell omics technologies to profile the tumor ecosystem, specifically to understand therapeutic resistance and identify predictive biomarkers for precision cancer medicine. Yet, very few of these biomarkers have adequate performance characteristics for adoption in clinical practice. We hypothesize that a fundamental facet of the tumor ecosystem, i.e., the spatial organization of cells, which encodes key information involving paracrine and juxtracrine interactions that drive “neighborhood- level” biology, can further inform predictive models. Recent technological breakthroughs in highly multiplexed imaging and spatial transcriptomics offer an unprecedented opportunity to delineate the therapeutic consequences of spatial relationships within clinical tumor samples. Quantitative spatial features can provide independent valuable information, which is unlikely to be captured by clinical, genetic and bulk-transcriptional predictors. Hence, we propose to integrate highly multiplexed imaging data with omic approaches to delineate mechanisms of resistance and build predictive models of response for patients with T-cell lymphoma, who have a desperate unmet clinical need. In Aim 1 (K99 phase), I will build automated computational tools to robustly quantify spatial features from highly multiplexed imaging data and integrate it with exome and RNA- Seq. I will utilize >100 primary specimens collected pre-, on- and after-treatment with the PI3K-δγ inhibitor duvelisib to nominate mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance. In Aim 2 (K99 phase), I will build an integrated machine-learning model to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from duvelisib and evaluate the impact of spatial features towards model performance. In Aim 3 (R00 phase), I will validate the model in an independent cohort and extend to samples from patients treated with additional agents, to identify consistent and parsimonious signatures of spatial features that could be developed for broader use. My extensive background in computational biology and experimental biology puts me in a unique position to accomplish this proposal. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators (Drs. David Weinstock, Peter Sorger, Jon Aster, Allon Klein, Peter Park, and Steven Horwitz) with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. I will acquire new skills in (1) computational analysis of highly multiplexed imaging to model molecular and spatial information, (2) data integration methods to delineate regulatory programs for designing effective drug combinations and (3) analysis of predictive biomarkers in clinical trial samples from clinical trials. Together with institutional support from Dana Farber Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital to transition into an independent position and establish an independent, data science-driven, translational research program. PROJECT NARRATIVE T-cell lymphomas (TCLs) are highly diverse and patients with relapsed disease have a dismal prognosis. The PI3K-δγ inhibitor duvelisib induces response in 60% of patients with TCL through tumor cell-intrinsic and immunomodulatory mechanisms, but nearly all responders ultimately develop resistance. We hypothesize that the integration of spatial data, including neighborhood analyses to identify para- and juxtacrine interactions, with genetic and transcriptional alterations will inform predictive models for duvelisib response and nominate mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance that can aid therapeutic selection and broadly applied across tumor types.",Integrative Prediction of Therapeutic Response in T-cell Lymphoma by Omic and Spatial Modeling,10115190,K99CA256497,"['1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase', 'Adoption', 'Aftercare', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Immune', 'JAK1 gene', 'JAK2 gene', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Non-Malignant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'T-Cell Lymphoma', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcription Alteration', 'Validation', 'Voting', 'base', 'cancer type', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'liquid crystal polymer', 'mRNA Expression', 'molecular modeling', 'multiplexed imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neural network', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'paracrine', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'precision oncology', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'random forest', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'single cell technology', 'skills', 'spatial integration', 'spatial relationship', 'spectrograph', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support vector machine', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational research program', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K99,2021,136080
"Artificial Intelligence driven prediction of brain metastasis from primary tumor sites at diagnosis Abstract: Metastasis from the primary tumor site to the brain is the most lethal complication of cancer progression and is experienced by approximately 20% of breast cancer patients worldwide. There is at present no translational approach to detect if a primary tumor has brain metastatic potential, no markers that predict successful future metastasis, and thus no therapies to target any of the processes involved. These gaps are difficult to bridge due to a lack of technology that can classify a cancer cell’s brain metastatic potential. Current in vivo murine models are slow to manifest metastasis and do not have the capability of capturing single cell morphology and dynamics; therefore, we propose a diagnostic platform to measure the phenotypic differences between cancer cells and to assign them a brain metastatic potential. The output is a quantitative diagnostic read out that defines the probability of a patient's cell metastasizing to the brain. Preliminary data suggests we may use this platform to brain metastatic behavior in 24-72 hrs. We have demonstrated that we can classify non-brain seeking and brain seeking cell lines based on phenotypic metrics such as migration, extravasation, shape and volume with a positive predictive value of 0.9. This study will validate the performance of this platform on patient cells. Further we aim to understand what components of the brain stromal space promote brain metastasis to further improve the performance of this technology and identify candidates that could be targeted by therapeutics to prevent metastasis in patients that have been identified as at risk. In summary, we propose a unique approach to measure the individual metastatic potential of tumor cells spatially and temporally. This work will result in both improved clinical stratification and, downstream from it, in a more robust set of targetable pathways for prevention of brain metastasis from breast and other primary sites.

"Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning This is a K23 award application for Dr. Andrew Sweatt, a pulmonary/critical care physician and young investigator at Stanford University who is establishing a niche in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) precision phenotyping. His work centers on using machine learning to reclassify PAH, where hidden patterns are detected in high-throughput molecular data to uncover new phenotypes. The existing PAH clinical classification does not inform therapy decisions, and outcomes are overall poor with a ‘one-size-fits-all’ treatment approach. There is a critical need for molecular phenotyping efforts, to develop classification schemes that sit closer to pathobiology and identify therapeutically-targetable patient subsets. Dr. Sweatt’s K23 builds on an innovative foundational study where he used machine learning to cluster PAH patients based on blood immune profiling, without guidance from clinical features. This agnostic approach uncovered 4 immune phenotypes with distinct cytokine profiles that are independent of clinical subtypes and stratify disease risk. These findings indicate that inflammation is a viable platform for PAH reclassification. Extensive research has implicated inflammation in PAH and multiple immune-targeting therapies are under active investigation, but these studies rest on the assumption that a common pathophenotype exists. The objective of Dr. Sweatt’s K23 is to better understand PAH immune phenotypes in terms of their longitudinal evolution, mechanistic underpinnings, and therapeutic implications. First, he will perform serial cytokine profiling in two observational cohorts (Stanford, USA; Sheffield, UK) to reassess immune phenotypes during the disease course (Aim 1). Based on preliminary data, dynamic phenotype switches may occur in some patients and reflect changes in clinical disease severity. Next, he will integrate blood transcriptomic profiling and apply sophisticated computational tools to provide phenotype-specific mechanistic insights (Aim 2). He postulates that distinct transcriptomic profiles will link phenotypes to specific signaling pathways and immune cell subsets. Findings will be validated using multi-cohort data from public repositories. Finally, he will perform post-hoc cytokine profiling in two recent PAH trial cohorts where immune modulators were tested, to assess if therapy responses differ across phenotypes (Aim 3). His research could help identify patients who will respond to specific therapies, inform clinical trial designs, lead to biomarker discovery, and define novel biology in PAH. The K23 will provide Dr. Sweatt with the critical support needed to transition to an independent research career and be a leader in PAH precision phenotyping. His K23 objectives are to gain experience in PAH clinical phenotyping/cohort building, expand expertise in bioinformatics, cultivate collaboration, and translate findings to new hypotheses for R01 development. He will be guided by a committed team of multidisciplinary mentors (Roham Zamanian [expert in PAH clinical trial design/biomarkers], Marlene Rabinovitch [leader in translational PAH research], and Purvesh Khatri [pioneer in bioinformatics]) and scientific advisors (Mark Nicolls [translational PAH immunology], PJ Utz [immunology], and Manisha Desai [biostatistics]). NARRATIVE This proposed research is aimed at classifying novel subtypes of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), by studying inflammation in the blood of patients (complex protein and genetic profiles) and using sophisticated computational methods (machine learning and systems-based network analysis) to find data patterns that would otherwise remain hidden. This research is relevant to public health as the burden of morbidity and mortality is high in PAH, and the current system used to classify patients does not inform treatment decisions. Our project has significant potential to improve public health, as it may yield a PAH classification scheme that sits closer to underlying pathobiology, provide a critical step toward identifying patients who will respond to specific therapies, help improve the design of forthcoming clinical trials, and create a framework for precision medicine.",Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning,10192823,K23HL151892,"['Address', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Growth Factor', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunomodulators', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mononuclear', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Public Health', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Pathway', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'career', 'chemokine', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'data repository', 'design', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'protein complex', 'public repository', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'trend']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,193536
"Image-based models of tumor-immune dynamics in glioblastoma ABSTRACT The use of immunotherapy to treat cancer continues to generate hope and excitement among those involved in cancer care and research. However, our inability to explain why some patients do not respond to immunotherapy, combined with our inability to identify early response or predict the responders, poses serious challenges in this field. Currently, biopsies serve as the most informative way to assess the immunological activity within a cancerous area, but we are spatially and temporally limited in the number of biopsies we can obtain from patients, especially in cases of brain cancer. Clear evidence of tumor-immune environment heterogeneity across patients suggests that we will have to use an individualized approach in order to accurately assess patient tumor’s specific immune environment and the evolution of these complex systems. We propose to use computational modeling and artificial intelligence to bridge the spatial scales of the cellular content comprising each MRI at the voxel level, but also to bridge the temporal scales. We will focus on the most cellular immune population in glioblastoma, microglia/macrophages, that constitute as much as 50% of the cellular content of tumor specimens. By fusing MRI with the biological heterogeneity found in image- localized biopsies through such radiomics approaches provides an opportunity to individualize our understanding of the the tumor-immune environment, broadly benefiting scientists across the fields of oncology and immunology. In addition to providing a deeper understanding of the tumor at every imaging time point, the radiomics maps can also be used to parameterize dynamic mechanistic models of tumor growth to allow for prediction of future dynamics. These spatio-temporal models allow us to test hypotheses about causal relationships between different cell types and microenvironmental factors, as well as to verify whether the radiomics maps provide early dynamic insights into tumor response that can impact clinical decision making. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our inability to explain why some patients do not respond to immunotherapy, combined with our inability to predict the responders, poses a serious challenge to advancing cancer care and research. Currently, biopsies serve as the most informative way to assess the immunological activity within a cancerous area, but we are spatially and temporally limited in the number of biopsies we can obtain from patients, especially in cases of brain cancer.

"Investigating the prognostic role of intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms in HNSCC ABSTRACT Head and neck cancer is one of the most prevalent aggressive cancers worldwide, with the majority being squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), or HNSCC. The well-known risk factors associated with the genesis of HNSCC include human papillomavirus and environment factors including tobacco and alcohol use. Despite more than two decades of research into the molecular genetics of HNSCC, there is still lack of prognostic biomarkers that can guide current treatment and management of HNSCC patients. Previous studies and our preliminary analysis showed that top immune-centric biomarkers had the most promising prognostic value for HNSCC patients compared to other immunotherapy-favorable cancers such as skin and lung cancers. In this R01 project, we propose a large-scale secondary analysis of existing transcriptomic and genetic data to elucidate the prognostic role of intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms in head and neck cancer. The underlying central hypothesis is that tumor-intrinsic and host-intrinsic immune signaling co-modulate the effectiveness of existing therapies in HNSCC; and elucidation of the interaction between targeted genomic/genetic alternations and background tumor-immune signatures via efficient statistical and machine learning methods can lead to novel prognostic biomarkers, as well as potential therapeutic targets. To this end, we propose three specifics aims. In the first aim, we will generate HNSCC-specific immune signatures by integrating single-cell and bulk-tumor transcriptomic data using novel machine learning methods developed by our team. In the second aim, we will discover and prioritize immune-related long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) biomarkers by recalling existing transcriptome data and applying an efficient genome-wide screening method. In the third aim, we will combine baseline germline variants with tumor immune signatures and further examine its prognostic value in patients treated by immune checkpoint blockade (provide by multiple institutes including Moffitt, OSU and UNC). Collectively, we propose the most extensive study to date in HNSCC investigating under-investigated element of the genomics source for predicting clinical and tumor immune phenotypes. The new omics data resource and resulted biomarkers, especially the immune-related biomarkers, from our research have potential to impact upon the diagnosis and prognosis of HNSCC patients and could guide more efficient and personalized immunotherapy selection in the future. NARRATIVE There is a pressing and unmet need to identify prognostic biomarkers in head and neck cancer. By repurposing existing genomic data available in public databases and at Moffitt, we propose the first large-scale study investigating the potential of immune mechanistic signatures and their mediators as biomarkers in predicting patient survival outcomes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Such knowledge may lead to improved identification of patient subgroups for development of novel and targeted therapies in HNSCC.",Investigating the prognostic role of intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms in HNSCC,10184419,R01DE030493,"['Alcohol consumption', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dissection', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Immune', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immune signaling', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Institutes', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Domains', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Tobacco use', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Tumor Markers', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical predictors', 'conventional therapy', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'genome wide screen', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunogenic', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'neoantigens', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'predictive signature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'secondary analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'survival outcome', 'targeted treatment', 'tertiary lymphoid organ', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NIDCR,H.

"Antigen-independent prediction and biomarker identification of cancer-specific T cells Project Summary/Abstract Cancer immunotherapy has achieved remarkable clinical success treating late-stage tumors, yet the response rates remain low and the side effects are often severe. Designing effective immunotherapies relies on accurate identification of tumor-reactive T cells. This is an extremely difficult task because 1) most of the cancer antigens are unknown; 2) the majority of the tumor-infiltrating T cells (TIL) does not recognize cancer cells; and 3) without known antigens, the only approach to acquire such T cells is to perform ex vivo expansion of TILs stimulated by autologous cancer cells, which generates non-specific T cells and is infeasible to many patients. Nonetheless, this strategy is widely adopted in current clinical trials for anti-cancer treatment, despite its reduced therapeutic efficacy and unpredictable side effects of autoimmunity. Therefore, unbiased, antigen- independent identification of tumor-reactive T cells, if possible, will be a major clinical priority as it will significantly increase the efficiency and safety of T cell based immunotherapies. Here we propose to achieve this goal through the development of novel machine learning methods. Such approach has not yet been explored because the fundamental difference between cancer and non-cancer T cells lies in their receptor sequences (TCR), and training data of cancer-specific TCRs is currently unavailable. To prepare for this task, we have developed the software TRUST, to extract the T cell antigen-binding CDR3 regions from bulk tumor RNA-seq data, and the software iSMART to group these CDR3s into antigen-specific clusters. These tools allowed us to develop a new rationale for producing large training sets of tumor-reactive TCRs, even without knowing cancer antigens. In our preliminary analysis, we observed that TCRs from the training data can be matched to tumor antigens that bind to HLA-A*02:01 and elicit immune response in vivo. The cancer-specific CDR3 amino acid sequences also show significantly different biochemical features from non-cancer ones, based on which we further developed software DeepCAT to demonstrate the feasibility of de novo prediction of cancer TCRs. These exciting results highlighted the importance to develop better computational method to track the tumor-reactive T cells for clinical applications. Accordingly, we propose the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will deliver a new machine learning method for accurate classification of tumor-reactive T cells using the CDR3 sequences. In Aim 2, we will derive a set of biomarkers for the cancer-specific T cells for fast and accurate flow sorting of these T cells from TILs. In Aim 3, we will perform single cell sequencing and functional validation of cancer-specific T cells using humanized animal model to validate the predicted genes, and to produce a prioritized list of promising targets for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy development. These Aims will be accomplished with the great support from the excellent collaborators specialized in cancer immunology at UTSW. Successful completion of this proposal will provide an exciting new paradigm to identify tumor-reactive T cells for precision cancer immunotherapies. Project Narrative Identification of tumor-specific T cells is critical to immunotherapy development, yet remains a challenging task. In this project we will develop a novel machine learning method to study: 1) which T cells in the tumor microenvironment are reactive to malignant cells; 2) what signature genes can be used to track the cancer- specific T cells.

"Evaluation of treatment predictors reflecting beta-catenin activation in hepatocellular carcinoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide and its incidence is rising in both men and women in the United States. Anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) antibodies are now FDA approved for advanced HCC, however, as few as 20% of patients receiving these agents will show an objective response to therapy. Because immune-related adverse events are non-trivial, predictive biomarkers that can explain the variability in immunotherapy response are needed to optimize patient selection.  Several lines of research have recently converged to associate oncogenic activation of the Wnt/beta- catenin signaling pathway with tumor immune-evasion and poor clinical response to ICI therapy in HCC. In previous research, we found that HCC exhibiting high uptake of the positron emission tomography / computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging agent 18F- fluorocholine (FCH) often belonged to molecular tumor sub-types associated with beta-catenin activation and immune avoidance. Liquid biopsy based on targeted sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has also made it possible to identify patients who have tumors that harbor mutations associated with increased Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.  This project comprises a phase 2 biomarker clinical trial to prospectively evaluate these specific embodiments of PET/CT and liquid biopsy as tools for detecting HCC recalcitrant to ICI therapy on the basis of beta-catenin activation. In addition to characterizing and comparing the predictive capabilities of FCH PET/CT and cfDNA mutation profiling based on phase 2 clinical endpoints, this project will utilize decision tree based machine learning to estimate the predictive performance of an integrative imaging-genomic biomarker while also further examining how tumor mutations are related to PET metabolic phenotype and immunotherapy response. Furthermore, because tumor 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake is incongruent with FCH uptake in HCC, a third aim will utilize the trial as a molecular screening process to create an enriched sub-cohort of patients with FDG-avid tumors. These patients will undergo serial FDG PET/CT to evaluate FDG as a source of predictive biomarkers of ICI response for an orthogonal molecular sub-type of HCC. If these diagnostic tests are found reliable at predicting tumor resistance/response, they could significantly enhance the clinical precision and overall benefit of immunotherapy for HCC and possibly other cancers. PROJECT NARRATIVE  While immune-checkpoint inhibitor antibodies are a major advance in cancer treatment, only a minority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (the most common form of primary liver cancer) will benefit from this form of immunotherapy. This project comprises a phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging and DNA sequencing based liquid biopsy as diagnostic tools for predicting resistance to immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma. The goal is to determine whether using these tests can potentially increase a patient’s chance of receiving a drug that will help them.",Evaluation of treatment predictors reflecting beta-catenin activation in hepatocellular carcinoma,10277385,R01CA262460,"['Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Effectiveness', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'FDA approved', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Induced Mutation', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minority', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Oncogenic', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Malignant Neoplasm of Liver', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor Markers', 'United States', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'advanced disease', 'anti-PD-1', 'anti-PD-L1', 'antibody inhibitor', 'base', 'beta catenin', 'blood-based biomarker', 'cancer therapy', 'cell free DNA', 'checkpoint therapy', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'determinants of treatment resistance', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'genomic biomarker', 'imaging agent', 'imaging biomarker', 'immune-related adverse events', 'improved', 'liquid biopsy', 'melanoma', 'men', 'metabolic phenotype', 'migration', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'mutational status', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'objective response rate', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'targeted sequencing', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'uptake']",NCI,QUEEN'S MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,520008
"Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response PROJECT SUMMARY Despite enormous success in treating several types of cancer, immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) therapy still only shows efficacies in a subset of patients. Identifying novel regulators of immunotherapy response as well as improving the response rate of cancer immunotherapies remain open questions. Recently, we used CRISPR screens in mouse models to investigate T-cell infiltration, proliferation, and killing efficacy, and identified PBAF of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex as one novel regulator of T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. We also developed a computational model, TIDE, to identify gene signatures of CD8 T-cell dysfunction in immune hot tumors and T-cell exclusion in immune cold tumors. The resulting signatures, computed from tumor profiles in non-immunotherapy setting, show promising results in predicting melanoma and lung cancer patient response to immune checkpoint blockade based on pre-treatment tumor expression profiles. This proposed project aims to improve the TIDE biomarkers, identify novel regulators, and elucidate their mechanisms underlying ICB response. In Aim 1, we will develop machine learning approaches on large collection of clinical tumor transcriptome profiles from non-ICB settings to refine the TIDE predictive biomarker of ICB response, and develop a web server to comprehensively evaluate different ICB response biomarkers in all the available ICB cohorts. In Aim 2, we will conduct in vivo CRISPR screens in mouse syngeneic tumor models to identify cancer-cell intrinsic regulators of ICB response, which can serve as novel targets to improve ICB response. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the mechanism underlying two novel regulators of ICB response and characterize their effects on the tumor immune microenvironment using single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC- seq, and computational modeling. Our investigative team has combined expertise in computational methodology immunotherapy. immunology and big data mining, functional genomics profiling Our proposed studies, if successfully executed, and translational benefits to cancer immunotherapy. and screening, cancer immunology and could provide new insights into cancer PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies have emerged over the last decade as highly promising approaches for cancer treatment, although only subsets of patients respond to immunotherapies.

"Development of a Universal Influenza Vaccine ABSTRACT Influenza virus (flu) ranks highest in disease burden of all infectious diseases as measured in disability-adjusted life years. Seasonal epidemics cause 200,000-500,000 worldwide deaths annually. The total economic burden of seasonal flu is estimated to range from approximately $26B to $87B each year in the US in terms of direct medical expenses and lost work and productivity. Additionally, at least six known flu pandemics have become global human catastrophes, most notably the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, which killed 3-5% of the world’s population. Any reduction in the infection rate, transmission, and severity of flu infection would greatly reduce our healthcare expenditures and improve the quality of life for millions of people every year. The current vaccines are formulated annually based on predictions of which circulating flu strains may be prevalent in a given season. The effectiveness of these vaccines varies from year to year based on the circulation of unexpected antigenic variants and other factors. Vaccine design is complicated the by the multiplicity of flu strains, each with rapidly-evolving dominant antigen epitopes (“decoy” epitopes) that largely stimulate strain- restricted immunity. One strategy for rational antigen design, termed Immune Refocusing Technology (IRT), involves introducing mutations that reduce the immunogenicity of these decoy epitopes thus shifting the immune response to target more widely-conserved subdominant epitopes. BMI has previously applied this IRT approach with some notable successes to other viral antigens (e.g. HRV and the RSV F protein), and we now focus on the major flu surface antigen glycoprotein HA using H1, H3, and B vaccine strains as parental antigens. The anticipated effort to design a suitably modified antigen would ordinarily involve a protracted process of trial-and-error testing of many potential candidates. However, we have recently developed the ANATOPE automated B cell epitope prediction software package with algorithm parameters tuned using methods in artificial intelligence. Our algorithm identifies epitopes with a significantly higher success rate than previously available prediction programs. This breakthrough allows us to assign immunogenicity “strength” scores to particular antigen surface patches and will further guide and accelerate the design of mutant antigens that refocus the immune response to cross-strain conserved epitopes. In this application, we propose to engineer and test the immunogenicity of rationally-designed HA antigens containing mutations that both 1) dampen the immunogenicity of dominant strain-restricted decoy epitopes and 2) enhance the immunogenicity of conserved subdominant epitopes associated with broadly neutralizing antibodies. Follow- up studies will assess the rationally-designed antigens in a ferret challenge study and prepare the approach for translation into humans as a universal vaccine that does not require annual reformulation. NARRATIVE Influenza is among the most important pathogens in terms of negative impact upon human health and healthcare expense. The current seasonal vaccines have a mixed record in terms of preventing illness and death. Development of improved vaccines is complicated by the rapid antigenic evolution of circulating viruses and the strain-restricted protections developed by our immune systems. In this proposal, we combine two novel technologies to develop universal influenza vaccines. The first, the Immune Refocusing Technology, is used to alter antibody binding sites, epitopes, such that the immune system can produce a broadened, cross-strain protective response. The second, a computational B cell epitope analysis program called ANATOPE, is used to guide the rational design of antigenic mutants bearing amino acid substitutions that stimulate improved immune responses. This project will focus on improving the breadth of protection stimulated by the three major components of the seasonal vaccine to reduce the need for annual reformulations. If successful, follow-up studies will include additional analysis in alternative animal models, a more comprehensive analysis of T cell immune responses, and preparation for advancement into IND-enabling studies.",Development of a Universal Influenza Vaccine,10211103,R43AI152652,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing Alternatives', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Binding Sites', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Baculoviruses', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Circulation', 'Body mass index', 'California', 'Cells', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Economic Burden', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Epitopes', 'Evolution', 'Ferrets', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Ha antigen', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hemagglutination', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hong Kong', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype', 'Insecta', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Recombinants', 'Seasons', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Serology test', 'Severities', 'Singapore', 'Site', 'Spanish flu', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surface Antigens', 'Switzerland', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Translations', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral Antibodies', 'Viral Antigens', 'Viral Physiology', 'Virus', 'Work', 'antiviral immunity', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'flu', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'infection rate', 'influenza infection', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'mutant', 'neutralizing antibody', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'seasonal influenza', 'success', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine', 'vaccine effectiveness']",NIAID,"BIOLOGICAL MIMETICS, INC.",R43,2021,299218
"Applying pathomics to establish a biosignature for aggressive skin melanoma. PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to develop a pathomics biosignature for aggressive melanoma to guide treatment decisions for patients who have had a melanoma surgically removed but remain at high risk of recurrence and death. This is a critical need because patients with stage II and III melanoma have an approximate 30% chance of dying of melanoma over 10 years. Therapies have been shown to lessen recurrence risk, but they are toxic and costly. Identifying patients who have truly been cured by the surgery and are cancer free would be tremendously useful to guide patient care. It has been known for decades that the immune system limits melanoma progression and that higher levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) portend a favorable outcome. Assessment of TILs, however, involves a subjective determination by the pathologist using qualitative criteria and this approach is prone to inter-observer variability. One barrier to the development of prognostic biomarkers in early stage melanoma is that the tumors are tiny and most dermato-pathologists require that the entire sample be formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) for careful morphology analysis. In order to overcome this barrier, our team has developed and published three digital pathology methods to estimate recurrence risk. These biomarkers are based on the hypothesis that evidence of strong immune surveillance within the tissue indicates lower recurrence risk and include quantitation of TILs using digital software, staining for macrophages and T cells using quantitative- immune-fluorescence (qIF), and measurement of an interferon signature using NanoString technology. Each of these methods provides unique information about the tumor immune micro-environment. For example, NanoString provides genomic information but does not provide spatial information regarding the locations of specific cell phenotypes within the tumor microenvironment as qIF does. For instance, qIF revealed the macrophages confer a poor prognosis specifically when located within the tumor stroma. In Aim 1 of the proposal we validate three previously published biomarkers using 514 melanoma samples from Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Institute, The University of British Columbia, Yale School of Medicine, and Geisinger Health Systems. Next, in Aim 2 of the proposal we propose an integrative systems biology approach including transcriptomic, qIF, morphology analysis of TILS, and standard clinical and pathology features to create a multi-parameter biosignature. First, we use the raw clinical and pathomics data to build a model multiscale biomarker network of aggressive skin melanoma. Using a Bayesian network, we identify nodes that determine the recurrence phenotype and identify new imaging and genomic targets that may enhance the precision of our biomarker. We then construct a composite biosignature based on this network. Finally, we test the new biosignature, as well as the original multiply validated biomarkers from Aim 1 in prospective retrospective fashion on samples from the E1697 trial of adjuvant interferon for which there is over 10 years of follow up. The retrospective prospective approach removes any selection bias introduced by retrospective study. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an urgent need to identify patients with stage II-III melanoma who have been cured by surgery, are not likely to recur, and should not receive further treatment. The immune system limits cancer progression but to date no biomarkers are available to define low risk groups. We further validate previously developed immune biomarkers and combine them to create a composite biosignature defining patients who can safely be spared the expense and toxicity of therapy.",Applying pathomics to establish a biosignature for aggressive skin melanoma.,10214049,R01CA260375,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Study', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Markers', 'British Columbia', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cutaneous', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Exposure to', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Roswell Park Cancer Institute', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Skin', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment-related toxicity', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Universities', 'Update', 'base', 'biosignature', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'macrophage', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mortality risk', 'multi-scale modeling', 'nano-string', 'network models', 'outcome forecast', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'tumor-immune system interactions']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,693456
