"The goal of the proposed research is to develop computer-aided diagnostic       
(CAD) schemes for detection of lung nodules, interstitial infiltrates, and      
pneumothoraces in digital chest images. We plan to develop advanced             
computerized schemes and software for improvements in sensitivity,              
specificity and efficiency in order to implement and evaluate such schemes      
in a controlled clinical environment. We believe that these computer-aided      
diagnostic schemes, which provide the radiologist with the location and/or      
quantitative measures of highly suspected lesions, have the potential to        
improve diagnostic accuracy in the detection of cancer by reducing human

detection of lung nodules by (a) combinations of linear and nonlinear           
morphological filtering techniques based on a difference image method for       
enhancement and suppression of lung nodules, (b) reduction of false

"The goal of the proposed research is the analysis of biological sequence

"We will reimplement two successful pharmacy-related expert systems,             
DoseChecker and Adverse Drug Event (ADE) Monitor, to exploit the existence      
of an extensive telemedicine network. DoseChecker provides drug dosing          
warnings based on pharmacy orders and patient specific features such as         
age, sex, weight, and estimated creatinine clearance. ADE Monitor examines      
patient drug orders and lab and lab test results, alerting hospital             
pharmacists when it detects signs of adverse drug events such as drug           
interactions. Once redeployed, these expert systems will be accessible to       
all clinical settings from which the clinical data repository collects the      
required data. During 1996, six hospital in Missouri and Illinois--Barnes,      
Jewish, Christian NE, Christian NW, Alton Memorial, and Barnes West             
County--will have the demographic, laboratory and pharmacy data required        
for DoseChecker and ADE Monitor entering the repository. This set of            
hospitals contains two academic facilities (Barnes and Jewish), two large       
community facilities (Christian NE and Alton Memorial) a small community        
facility (Barnes West County), and a predominantly ambulatory care              
facility (Christian NW). The reimplemented systems will serve as a              
telemedicine test bed to examine the impact of large-scale, wide-are            
deployment of clinical decision support in diverse clinical environments.       
Specifically, we will evaluate the expert system performance, physician         
acceptance, and clinical settings. By exploiting the existence of a             
standard clinical vocabulary and extensive networking interconnectivity,        
we can provide identical CDS functionality at clinical practice settings        
which preciously would pose significant technological barriers and require      
substantial rework. By keeping the decision support system constant, our        
evaluation studies will allow us to study the impact of clinical-setting        
variables on the effectiveness of these tow systems. In addition, we will       
implement and evaluate multiple decision support alert notification             
methods including GUI-based applications, E-mail, fax/printer reports,          
automated paging, and interactive voice massaging using commercial              
telephony products to examine the impact of alternative notification            
methods on the timeliness and clinical impact of decision support alerts.       
Using this telecommunications-based notification infrastructure, we also        
will investigate the patient confidentiality and privacy compromises which      
may occur due to alternative notification methods. By permitting multiple       
clinicians, possibly in different locations, to be notified of alerting         
conditions, we can also assess the impact or value of collaborative use of      
this technology to treat BJC patients. With our study decision, we can          
examine explicit trade-offs between alerting methods, decision support          
effectiveness, and patient confidentiality.

age, sex, weight, and estimated creatinine clearance. ADE Monitor examines      
patient drug orders and lab and lab test results, alerting hospital             
pharmacists when it detects signs of adverse drug events such as drug           
interactions. Once redeployed, these expert systems will be accessible to       
all clinical settings from which the clinical data repository collects the      
required data. During 1996, six hospital in Missouri and Illinois--Barnes,      
Jewish, Christian NE, Christian NW, Alton Memorial, and Barnes West             
County--will have the demographic, laboratory and pharmacy data required        
for DoseChecker and ADE Monitor entering the repository. This set of            
hospitals contains two academic facilities (Barnes and Jewish), two large       
community facilities (Christian NE and Alton Memorial) a small community        
facility (Barnes West County), and a predominantly ambulatory care              
facility (Christian NW). The reimplemented systems will serve as a              
telemedicine test bed to examine the impact of large-scale, wide-are            
deployment of clinical decision support in diverse clinical environments.       
Specifically, we will evaluate the expert system performance, physician         
acceptance, and clinical settings. By exploiting the existence of a             
standard clinical vocabulary and extensive networking interconnectivity,        
we can provide identical CDS functionality at clinical practice settings        
which preciously would pose significant technological barriers and require      
substantial rework. By keeping the decision support system constant, our        
evaluation studies will allow us to study the impact of clinical-setting        
variables on the effectiveness of these tow systems. In addition, we will       
implement and evaluate multiple decision support alert notification             
methods including GUI-based applications, E-mail, fax/printer reports,          
automated paging, and interactive voice massaging using commercial              
telephony products to examine the impact of alternative notification            
methods on the timeliness and clinical impact of decision support alerts.       
Using this telecommunications-based notification infrastructure, we also        
will investigate the patient confidentiality and privacy compromises which      
may occur due to alternative notification methods. By permitting multiple       
clinicians, possibly in different locations, to be notified of alerting         
conditions, we can also assess the impact or value of collaborative use of      
this technology to treat BJC patients. With our study decision, we can          
examine explicit trade-offs between alerting methods, decision support          
effectiveness, and patient confidentiality.

"The solution to the protein folding problem is critical to an                   
understanding of the naturally occurring proteins and their deliberately

has been directed towards understanding which sequences can form stable         
helices.  Two converging lines of investigation in our lab have focused         
separately on the central and terminal residues within the helix.  For          
central residues, it is hypothesized that sidechain entropy is the              
principal factor that governs helix propensity.  For terminal residues,         
it is hypothesized that ""capping"" H-bonds between sidechain polar groups        
and the otherwise unsatisfied initial four amide hydrogens or final four        
carbonyl oxygens in the mainchain are the major factor in helix

This work, which is well underway, will be extended to include other            
categories of secondary structure as well.  Following the approach used         
for helices, residues in beta-sheet can be modelled in each                     
microenvironment, in either middle or edge strands and at the center or         
terminus of the strand.  Nonrepetitive structure can also be included.          
                                                                                
Preliminary results suggest that many residues have clearly

example, valine in the unfolded state can populate all three sidechain          
conformers almost equivalently, but essentially only one conformer when         
in a helix.  The corresponding energy loss (T-delta-S) due solely to the        
reduction in sidechain entropy is approximately RTln3, of order                 
physiological kT.  These energy terms, which cause residues to favor one        
type of secondary structure over others, though individually modest, are        
significant in the aggregate, when summed over an entire helix or sheet.

He will further his research training through study of issues surrounding the creation and validation of clinical measurement tools.  Dr. Tirschwell has been studying the prehospital care of stroke patients in Seattle, Washington in collaboration with members of the Departments of Neurology and Epidemiology and Seattle Medic One (fire department). The hypothesis is that this continued collaboration can produce a rapid, reliable, easy to use stroke evaluation tool for the prehospital setting that will facilitate accurate identification and efficient transport times for acute stroke patients.  A further hypothesis is that with this same tool, one can provide a useful early measure of stroke severity.  Two versions of the MOSS will be created, a cohort of patients evaluated with each, and Dr. Tirschwell will examine the patients at a 3-month follow-up visit to determine outcomes.  The first version (prediction) will record historical and clinical variables and evaluation and transport times.  The shorter second version (validation), incorporating only the most predictive variables, will be associated with diagnosis and triage algorithms to minimize transport time for the most urgent stroke cases.  The ease of use, reliability and predictive value of the MOSS will be validated in the second cohort and compared with the Glasgow Coma Scale and medical record abstracted NIHSS.  Diagnostic accuracy, transport times, proportion of ischemic stroke patients receiving tPA and outcomes will be compared between the first and second cohorts. As stroke therapeutic research moves into the prehospital setting, the MOSS will serve as a standardized evaluation tool allowing early and accurate stroke diagnosis and severity stratification.  artificial intelligence; automated medical record system; brain disorder chemotherapy; cerebral hemorrhage; cerebral ischemia /hypoxia; cerebrovascular disorder diagnosis; clinical research; diagnosis quality /standard; disease /disorder classification; disease /disorder onset; early diagnosis; health care service evaluation; health care transport service; health services research tag; hospital utilization; human subject; human therapy evaluation; longitudinal human study; outcomes research; plasminogen activator; prognosis; rapid diagnosis; stroke; telecommunications; training MEDIC ONE STROKE SCALE","As stroke therapies emerge, they will likely work better if given earlier after stroke onset.
