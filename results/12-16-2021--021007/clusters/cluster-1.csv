"The long term goal of our research is to understand the flow of
 information from the genome to the phenotype of organisms. In this
 proposal, we will attempt to use Bayesian networks and near-optimal
 sequence alignments to represent protein secondary structures and motifs.
 A Bayesian network describes the likelihood of amino acids at each
 position in a motif as well as the dependence of amino acids in one
 position on the amino acids at other position. Hence, Bayesian networks
 can describe both the conservation of amino acids at single positions and
 the conservation of correlations between two positions simultaneously.
 
 Conserved amino acids result from evolutionary selection for a specific
 amino acid or type of amino acid at one position in a protein structure.
 These positions often have important functional or structural
 requirements. Correlated changes between amino acids generally result from
 side-chain side-chain interactions between pairs of amino acids in a
 protein's structure. The types of correlations we have represented with
 Bayesian networks include electrostatic charges, hydrophobicity, hydrogen-
 bond donor and acceptor and inversely correlated packing volumes among
 others. These Bayesian networks can be used to 1) discover side-chain
 side--chain interactions within protei motifs and 2) to search sequence
 databases for motifs showing both correlations and conserved amino acids.
 
 Near-optimal alignments between two sequences can display regions that
 have been more highly conserved or less highly conserved using the
 information contained in only two sequences. The most highly conserved
 region correspond to the most highly structured regions and the most
 highly variable regions correspond to loops and coils and other
 hypervariable regions. We propose to use near-optimal alignments to
 display conserved secondary structures of proteins and hypervariable
 regions. We will use secondary-structure specific amino acid substitution
 matrices to provide specificity.
 
 The goals of this proposal are to 1) build a database of Bayesian networks
 that represent protein motifs, 2) test these networks for their ability to
 detect motifs using test sets and crossvalidation methods, 3) compare
 these networks with other methods for searching protein databases , 4)
 build an integrated set of Bayesian networks to predict protein secondary
 structure, 5) compare the prediction of protein secondary structure with
 existing method 6) build a near-optimal sequence alignment workbench, and
 7) predict structured and unstructured regions in proteins from near-
 optimal alignments.

"Abstractions of time-stamped clinical data are useful for planning
