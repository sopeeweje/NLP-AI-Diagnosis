"The long-term objectives of the proposed research are to elucidate the          
stages of speaking skill development in infants and the motor control           
mechanisms for speech production in adults.  These research areas are           
important for early diagnosis and proper treatment of speech disorders.         
The proposed research consists primarily of the development, refinement,        
and experimental testing of a comprehensive neural network modeling             
framework for speech production based on preliminary work described in          
Guenther (Appendices A).  Model additions will include an articulatory          
mechanism that allows synthesis of speech wave-forms and an acoustic-like       
coordinate frame for speech movement planning.  Proposed research also          
includes the development of software for producing speaker-specific vocal       
tract models based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans.  These models     
will allow synthesis of speech signals that account for the differences in      
vocal tract sizes and shapes of different individuals, thus providing a         
more accurate means for investigating the acoustic/articulatory                 
relationships of individuals acting as subjects in speech production            
experiments.  An experimental investigation utilizing these speaker-            
specific vocal tract models is also proposed to test an hypothesis              
generated by the modeling framework.  Some speakers use two entirely            
different articulator configurations, called ""bunched"" and retroflex"", to       
produce /r/ in different contexts.  The proposed model predicts that the        
same target is specified tot he production mechanism in the two cases, but      
that different articulator configurations arise in different contexts due       
to two properties of the speech production mechanism: (1) movement planning     
in an acoustic-like coordinate frame, and (2) transformation of the planned     
acoustic trajectories into articulator movements via a direction-to-            
direction mapping.  Speaker-specific vocal tract models corresponding to        
two subjects will be incorporated into the proposed modeling framework,         
which will then be used to predict which configuration each subject will        
use to produce /r/ in each of four contexts.  The hypothesis will be tested     
by comparing model performance with the performance of the subjects while       
producing /r/ in the same four contests, as measured in an Electro-Magnetic     
Midsagittal Articulometer (EMMA) study.  Finally, the proposed modeling         
framework will be used to investigate several other issues in speech            
production, including two modeling studies of speech motor development in       
infants (made possible by the self-organizing nature of the proposed            
model), and an investigation of intrinsic timing issues.                        
    GRANT=R01DE09161                                                            
The ability to utilize hemin and hemin containing compounds as an iron          
source has been documented for several pathogenic bacteria, including the       
periodontopathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis.  We have previously               
determined that P. gingivalis transports the entire hemin moiety into the       
cell by an energy-dependent mechanism and that the binding and accumulation     
of hemin are induced by growth of cultures in the presence of hemin.            
However, the specific P. gingivalis components involved in hemin binding        
and transport have not been identified.  Growth of P. gingivalis under          
hemin-replete conditions has also been shown to influence the expression of     
several virulence factors; however, the role of hemin in the regulation of      
specific virulence genes has not been precisely defined.                        
                                                                                
The primary objectives of the present application are to define the             
molecular mechanisms involved in hemin binding and transport in P.              
gingivalis and to examine the regulation of hemin responsive genes.  Four       
specific aims are proposed:                                                     
                                                                                
1.  To identify and characterize athe P. gingivalis hemin receptor(s).  P.      
gingivalis outer membrane proteins involved in hemin binding will be            
identified by hemin affinity chromatography.  The specificity of the            
putative receptor(s) will be defined by examining the binding of 14[C]hemin     
to P. gingivalis in the presence of hemin and nonahemin iron sources.           
                                                                                
2.  To clone P. gingivalis genes encoding proteins involved in hemin            
binding and transport.  P. gingivalis genes encoding hemin binding proteins     
will be cloned by screening E. coli recombinants for the ability to bind        
hemin.  P. gingivalis genes encoding proteins involved in hemin transport       
will be cloned by screening E. coli hemA mutants for the ability to grow        
with hemin.  Corresponding P. gingivalis mutants will be obtained by            
insertional inactivation of the cloned genes and characterized both in          
vitro and in vivo.                                                              
                                                                                
3.  To elucidate the regulation of hemin binding and transport genes.  The      
regulation of cloned P. gingivalis genes involved in hemin binding and          
transport will be examined by analysis of mRNA and transcriptional fusions      
under hemin-deplete and -replete conditions.                                    
                                                                                
4.  To identify P. gingivalis genes that are regulated by the ferric uptake     
regulator (Fur).  Our preliminary results indicate that the expression of       
hemin/iron-responsive genes in P. gingivalis may be controlled by the           
negative ferric uptake regulator protein, Fur.  We will begin to identify       
P. gingivalis genes that are regulated by Fur by screening a P. gingivalis      
genomic library using the Fur titration asssay.                                 
                                                                                
The results obtained in these studies will allow us to identify specific        
components of the hemin transport system in P. gingivalis and will provide      
important information on the regulation of hemin responsive genes.

patients.                                                                       
                                                                                
Recent evidence demonstrates that the electrophysiologic state of the           
atrium is a primary determinant of both the history of atrial                   
fibrillation and its response to therapy. This provides a strong                
rationale for developing techniques for assessing atrial                        
electrophysiology during fibrillation.                                          
                                                                                
The Creare team proposes to develop a noninvasive technique for                 
assessing and classifying atrial fibrillation based on the surface              
electrocardiogram.  This technique will assist clinicians in determining        
treatment strategies for patients suffering from atrial fibrillation.           
PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION                                                 
Creare's technique for noninvasive assessment of atrial fibrillation            
will provide the clinician with a powerful new tool for optimizing              
patient treatment.  The technique is based on straightforward processing        
algorithms that can be readily incorporated into existing                       
electrocardiogram systems.

"DESCRIPTION:  The proposed research is designed to develop more effective       
self-help interventions for smoking cessation.  Smoking is the most             
preventable cause of cancer mortality, but 47 million Americans continue to     
smoke.  Smoking cessation clinics have reached only about 1 percent of          
eligible smokers.  Home based programs that are action-oriented reach only      
about 1-5 percent.  In the current study using stage-matched interventions      
and proactive recruitment 85 percent of a defined population of smokers in      
an HMO were reached.  It is proposed that this marked increase in               
participation rates needs to be complimented by dramatic increases in           
cessation rates of the most promising self-help interventions developed to      
date.  The proposed research is a continuation of 15 years of research on       
self-change approaches to smoking cessation already funded by NIH.  This        
research program has produced models, measures and intervention methods that    
are having major impacts on the field.  The current project has accomplished    
all of the aims proposed including unprecedented participation rates,           
individualized and interactive interventions outperforming self-help manuals    
at 1, 2 3 and 6 series of contacts; enhanced proactive counselor protocols      
producing high abstinence rates at 12 months, and a low cost single contact     
expert system producing relatively high abstinence rates.  The proposed         
extension is a population based clinical trial with 5500 smokers proactively    
recruited from an HMO and randomly assigned to one of nine conditions           
varying from low to high contact intensity.  These conditions include:  1)      
no treatment; 2) proactive assessment every six months; 3) single expert        
system intervention; 4) a matched modality intervention combining the best      
modality for smokers in each of three stages of change; 5)the investigators     
most effective three intervention expert system; 6) and 7) enhanced personal    
choice and professional choice versions of the standard systems; 8) an          
enhanced proactive counseling condition with counselor fading; and 9) a         
stepped care population program progressing from expert systems, to             
counseling and nicotine replacement where indicated.  Data analyses will        
identify the most effective, cost-effective and generalizable elements of       
these smoking cessation interventions in preparation for dissemination to       
entire populations.  This research is designed to continue the                  
investigators' contributions to cancer control by developing and evaluating     
stage-matched, interactive and proactive self-help interventions that have
