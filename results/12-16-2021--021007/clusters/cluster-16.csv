"We propose to develop accurate models of the electrical properties of the       
human head.  The Physical Head Model will be constructed with layers of         
conductive plastics varying in electrical resistivity.  Imbedded current        
sources will be driven through a computer interface.  The source waveforms      
will include representations of actual EEG data corresponding to different      
physiological states, computed waveforms will include representations of        
actual EEG data corresponding to different physiological states, computed       
waveforms with known statistical variation in both time and space, and          
waveforms generated by mathematical models of neocortical dynamic               
function.  The Digital Head Model will simulate the physical model, and it      
will allow exploration of a variety of source geometries and head tissue        
conductivities.  The Digital Head Model will include anatomical                 
registration procedures to facilitate forward modeling with neuroimaging        
data such as from the BrainMap database.  The Head Models will provide          
critical tests of the validity of present and future source localization        
methods.  These Models will form a basis for interactive training programs      
in human brain electrophysiology for both research and clinical settings.       
                                                                                
PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  In addition to use in research                
laboratories, the simulations will support training curricular for              
neurology residence programs., cognitive neuroscience graduate programs,

"DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): The applicants proposed        
to  develop adaptive imaging algorithms and instrumentation to compensate       
for  tissue-induced ultrasonic image degradation.  Theoretical and              
simulation  studies are proposed to optimize the accuracy, stability, and       
speed of  adaptive algorithms and to explore the impact of transducer           
design on adaptive  imaging.  In addition, the applicants proposed to           
collect high-quality tissue  echo data and through-transmission data to         
investigate the nature of tissue- induced image degradation.  The               
adaptive imaging techniques would be implemented in real-time on an             
advanced engineering prototype scanner.  Synthetic receive aperture (SRA)       
techniques, combined with adaptive imaging,  would be used to address           
1000 and 2000 element two dimensional (2-D) arrays  and to form very high       
resolution images.  Specialized analog multiplexers and  other hardware         
would be constructed for this system.  Clinical trials would  evaluate          
the performance of the adaptive/SRA system in imaging breast lesions  and       
breast microcalcifications, and in renal and adrenal gland imaging              
studies.  The applicants hypothesized that the proposed techniques and          
system  would markedly improve ultrasonic image quality in a wide variety       
of clinical  applications.

The goal of this project is to automate and improve the prediction of           
protein structure and function based on multiple sequence data.  Specific       
aims are to:  1) partition the entire sequence database into a comprehensive    
set of homologous protein domains; 2) design advanced, family-specific          
multiple alignment models of these domains; 3) develop statistical              
procedures for estimating the significance of sequence-to-model similarity      
scores; 4) devise corresponding alignment optimization procedures; and 5)       
develop tools for predicting aspects of protein structure and function based    
on these alignments.  Methods include Gibbs sampling and hidden Markov model    
procedures for multiple sequence alignment, structural threading methods,       
dynamic programming and BLAST-like database search procedures, and other        
statistical and algorithmic methods.  A comprehensive database of protein       
domains will be made available to the biomedical community through the
