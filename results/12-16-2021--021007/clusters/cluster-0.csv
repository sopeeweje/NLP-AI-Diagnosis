"New algorithms and computer software tools will be developed to aid in
 identifying the function of newly-generated sequences.  This work will
 have important practical applications for human and model organism genome
 sequencing projects.  Significant insights into the potential function
 of newly-generated sequences of unknown biological function (e.g.,
 anonymous cDNAs), can be obtained if similarity to sequences of known
 function can be detected.  Current sequence database search programs can
 fail to detect similarity between distantly related sequences incases
 where functional domains contain a few key residues that are dispersed
 along the primary sequence (e.g., ""zinc-finger"" DNA binding domains).
 This is because, in the generation of alignment scores, mismatches at
 non-conserved residues can easily outweigh matches at the few key sites.
 To overcome this problem, we propose to develop new pattern construction
 and search methodologies that identify and utilize only conserved
 residues and domains in sequence similarity searches.  First, techniques
 to identify conserved regions within protein sequences will be used to
 construct a new type of sequence database in which only the conserved
 regions are represented in each sequence.  This database should
 significantly improve the ability to detect distantly related sequences
 by reducing the number spurious, but statistically significant, matches
 to unrelated sequences during a database search.  Second, methods will
 be developed to exploit information on 1)sequence family relationship and
 2) the positions of conserved domains within related sequences in
 sequence database searches.  These new tools will aid in distinguishing
 weak matches for distantly related sequences from the alignments of
 unrelated but statistically significant matches in database searches.
 Third, new pattern libraries will be constructed from sequence and
 sequence similarity data available in the Entrez: Sequences database,
 produced by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
 This will allow functional information in the covering pattern databases
 to be directly cross-referenced to sequence and sequence annotation
 information in Entrez database, providing value-added benefits for both
 databases.  Fourth, the high-speed database search tool BLAST will be
 adapted for pattern database searches.  This will provide a fast and
 sensitive search tool for identifying the function of newly-generated
 sequences.  Fifth, the use of concave gap penalties and suboptimal
 alignments will be incorporated into our Pattern-Induced Multi-sequence
 Alignment (PIMA) algorithm.  These new extensions will significantly
 enhance the quality of the patterns and multiple sequence alignments
 generated by PIMA.  These new analysis tools should prove invaluable to
 genome scientists and molecular biologists as they isolate genes and
 proteins of unknown biological function.
