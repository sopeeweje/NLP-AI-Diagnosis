"DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract):  Numerous
 restriction mapping programs have been devised since 1978, but none of them
 is as precise as manual map construction using digest gel photos, pencil,
 and graph paper.  Given realistic data, programs usually find hundreds or
 even thousands of solutions, only one of which can be correct.  Because of
 this, slow and demanding manual techniques are still in common use.  The
 researchers propose to develop public domain software implementing a
 complete restriction mapping environment which will be far more powerful
 and useful than current restriction mapping software.  This system will:
 1) find solutions more quickly than any existing software; 2) find far
 fewer false maps than any existing software; 3) allow the user to ""steer""
 the entire mapping process (if desired); and 4) guide the user with
 detailed, expert advice on handling specific mapping problems as they
 arise.  In addition, the system will have:  5) built-in extensibility, so
 that simple modifications will also allow other genetic marker mapping
 problems to be solved by the same program and 6) the ability to record all
 user activity transparently, providing quantitative data on successful
 mapping strategies.
 
 The system will be based on extant restriction mapping programs, but it
 will overcome their limitations by including the following additional
 capabilities:  1) All known heuristics will be implemented.  (Heuristics
 are logical rules of thumb which guide the search towards a true solution.)
 Existing programs use only a small subset of the known heuristics.  Every
 added heuristic will speed up the search and reduce the set of possible
 solutions to a problem.  2) Hand mapping will be simulated on-screen via a
 ""what you see is what you get"" graphical user interface, with users
 choosing fully automatic mapping (the default), fully manual mapping (with
 simulated pencils and log paper), or various in-between levels of
 semi-automatic assisted mapping.  This will allow users to control or
 adjust any part of the mapping process if they so desire.  3) An expert
 system (a program which can answer queries and make decisions by consulting
 a knowledge database) will guide users through the mapping process.  It
 will assist the process of data acquisition, help the user solve
 difficulties, and tutor inexperienced users.
 
 Considerable preliminary design work has already taken place, so
 implementation can begin almost at once.  Software will be developed and
 tested iteratively (""rapid prototyping"") to assure end-user satisfaction.
 To insure portability at the source code level, the two major modules of
 the system (fragment length derivation and mapping) will be coded in C++
 using Boochs' object-oriented design methodology, and the user interface
 will be designed using a portable interface-building tool that works on a
 variety of computing platforms (including DOS machines, and the Macintosh).
 The expert system will be implemented using CLIPS, a portable C-based
 public domain expert system shell.

"DESCRIPTION (Adapted from applicant's abstract):  This K02 application          
out-lines research and career development plans to investigate the role of      
sleep regulation in the developmental psychobiology of affective disorders.     
The first goal is to extend a well-established line of research based on        
measures of EEG sleep and cortisol in child and adolescent depression by        
investigating:  (1) abnormalities in sleep and cortisol regulation focusing     
on the sleep-onset transition; (2) normal maturational changes in sleep and     
cortisol regulation relevant to these abnormalities; and (3) the predictive     
validity of sleep and cortisol abnormalities in longitudinal clinical           
follow-up.                                                                      
                                                                                
The second goal is to further develop and investigate a larger developmental    
model of sleep regulation.  The model emphasizes close links between sleep      
regulation and neurobehavioral systems involved in the regulation of affect     
and arousal which are modulated in regions of prefrontal cortex (PFC).          
Matur-ational changes in PFC-subcortical circuits influencing sleep,            
arousal, and affect are hypothesized to contribute to sleep changes             
associated with depression, particularly near the transition from               
wakefulness into sleep.  Based on this model, predictions are made regarding    
sleep changes in the development of affective disorders and effects of sleep    
deprivation of affective regulation.  The long-term goal of this work is to     
understand mechanisms of dysregulation which may lead to more effective

"DESCRIPTION:  Numerous practical and theoretical problems could be addressed    
if we had a better understanding of the auditory mechanisms underlying          
phonetic recognition.  Among the practical applications of this knowledge       
are:  (1) the improvement of speech synthesis devices, (2) the development      
of robust speech recognition devices, (3) the development of acoustically       
based training devices for hearing-impaired speakers, and (4) improvement in    
Cochlear-implant signal processors.  The proposed experiments fall into         
three major categories.  One set of experiments follows in a rather direct      
way from vowel perception studies conducted during the previous grant           
period.  These experiments address issues such as the role of dynamic           
spectral cues and voice fundamental frequency in vowel perception.  A second    
series of experiments address more fundamental issues regarding the spectral    
representations that control phonetic quality.  A major goal of these           
experiments is to test the validity of a method of representing speech that     
was developed during the previous grant period.  The ""Masked Peak               
Representation"" (MPR) was developed as an alternative to both formant           
representations and whole spectrum models.  The MPR involves a series of        
spectral manipulations that are designed to remove aspects of the spectrum      
that do not appear to have a strong influence on phonetic quality, while        
retaining those features that are most relevant to phonetic quality             
judgments.  The MPR will be evaluated with:  (1) an experiment comparing        
MPR-based predictions of perceived phonetic distance with those of a more       
traditional auditory model, (2) speech recognition tests that use a Hidden      
Markov Model to map sequences of MPR spectra onto words or phonetic             
segments, and (3) listening tests with speech resynthesized from MPR            
spectra.  A third set of studies is aimed at modeling the low-level auditory    
mechanisms that are responsible for spectrum analysis.  The goal of this        
work is to evaluate a model of spectrum analysis that is carried out by the     
central auditory system rather than the auditory periphery.  A software         
simulation of the model will be developed in an effort to determine the         
extent to which the central-spectrum model can account for a broad range of

"DESCRIPTION:  The proposed research will focus on the mechanisms of electron    
transfer and proton pumping in respiration.  Special emphasis will be on        
cytochrome oxidase, the primary site of coupling between the two processes.     
Our goals include the following:  1) The mechanism of the reduction of          
dixoygen to water by cytochrome oxidase will be studied under a variety of      
conditions with the flow-flash method, which uses the photolability of the      
CO complex to initiate the redox activity with O2.  Time-resolved               
multichannel optical absorption spectroscopy will be used to follow the         
kinetics of electron and proton transfer on time scales of nanoseconds to       
milliseconds.  Singular value decomposition and global exponential fitting      
methods will be applied to analyze the kinetics and determine the UV-Vis        
spectra of the transient intermediates.  These studies should provide new       
insight into the mechanism of the dioxygen reduction by cytochrome oxidase.     
2) Alternatives to CO photodissociation will be used to investigate the         
reaction of O2 with cytochrome oxidase.  The reaction of unliganded reduced     
cytochrome oxidase with oxygen will be studied using a superfast direct         
mixing method, pulsed-accelerated-flow (PAF).  The reaction of oxygen with      
the unliganded enzyme will also be investigated using O2 which is produced      
in situ on any relevant time scale by photodissociating synthetic dioxygen      
carriers such as dicobalt u-peroxo polyaine complexes.  Both the PAF method     
and the photodissociation of the dicobalt u-peroxo and u-superoxo polyamine     
complexes represent new approaches to study the fast dioxygen reactions of      
cytochrome oxidase and both avoid the mechanistic ambiguities associated        
with the fate of photodissociated CO in transitional flow-flash experiments.    
3) The mechanism of the redox-linked proton pump in cytochrome oxidase will     
be investigated.  The kinetics of electron transfer and proton pumping upon     
flash-induced oxidation of cytochrome oxidase reconstituted into

absorption spectroscopy.  The proton pumping reactions will be probed by pH     
indicators located int he extra-vesicular space, trapped inside the             
vesicles, or covalently bound to the lipid or protein.  These studies will      
allow us to correlate proton pumping events with individual steps in the
