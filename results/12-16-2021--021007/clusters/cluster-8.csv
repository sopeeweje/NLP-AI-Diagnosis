"Novel procedures for genetic engineering [i.e. Target Set Mutagenesis
 (TSM) and Recursive Ensemble Mutagenesis (REM)] will be used to construct
 populations of phenotypically related proteins whose members differ in
 amino acid sequence.  TSM and REM enable a genetic engineer to mutagenize
 (in a combinatorial fashion) more positions in a protein than would
 otherwise be possible by taking advantage of the ""structure"" of the
 genetic code and by reducing the sequence complexity of DNA cassettes
 used in mutagenesis.  REM employs a feedback mechanism to further
 restrict sequence complexity: Each iteration of REM uses information
 gained from previous iterations to search ""sequence space"" more
 efficiently for mutants fitting the experimenter's screening or selection
 criteria.  Computer simulations and preliminary experiments show that TSM
 and REM produce diverse populations of proteins fitting specific
 phenotypic criteria.  An efficient means of screening very large numbers
 of mutants uses Digital Imaging Spectroscopy (DIS), i.e. instrumentation
 that simultaneously records the spectra of hundreds of colonies on a
 petri dish.  Initial experiments will utilize a pigment binding protein
 (LHII), because simple absorption spectroscopy can be used to assess
 protein expression, structure, and function.  These combinatorial
 optimization methods have been designed to be independent of the type of
 protein, selection, or screen actually used.  TSM and REM technology will
 be transferred to other areas of protein engineering, such as the
 expression of health-related peptides and proteins on phage display
 libraries to obtain altered proteins with desirable properties.  This
 constitutes a ""reverse engineering"" of the protein design problem.

"There are several evidences to show that the early detection of breast          
cancer can reduce mortality from the disease. Also, X-ray film screen           
mammography has shown more sensitivity and specificity to detect                
tumors than any other non-invasive diagnostic techniques that are               
currently used. Hence, in this study digital mammograms are                     
considered. The digital mammography also facilitates the use of                 
computer aided detection and diagnosis that are the focus of this               
study.                                                                          
                                                                                
In 90% of in situ carcinomas, calcifications are the dominant                   
abnormality. Therefore, as far as the early stage cancers are                   
concerned, the proportion of lesions detected on the basis of                   
microcalcifications are becomingly increasingly greater. Further,               
about 80% of the breast cancers are found to contain                            
microcalcifications on histology examination. Therefore, the accurate           
detection of microcalcifications should facilitate in early detection           
of breast cancer and saving human lives. It is possible to detect               
these microcalcifications by using detection algorithms since they              
exhibit difference in density, size and shape from normal anatomic              
structures. Hence, the focus of this study is to develop and evaluate           
detection/segmentation algorithms based on 2D wavelets and                      
probabilistic networks. The microcalcifications classified as                   
suspicious in the segmented image (mammogram) will be highlighted for           
close examination by a radiologist. The technology that results from            
this study can be considered as a tool that helps a radiologist in              
detecting and diagnosing breast cancer in an efficient way. The main            
advantages of the proposed approach are: (1) noise reduction, (2)               
image enhancement and (3) good segmentation. Since in general,                  
mammograms are poor quality images with low contrast due to the small           
differences in X-ray attenuation between breast tissues and noisy, the          
detection techniques that reduce noise and enhance images would                 
improve the detection performance.                                              
                                                                                
PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:                                               
The proposed Phase I study will result in a novel methodology that (a)          
enhances the image quality of mammogram, (b) accurately segments and            
detects microcalcifications, (c) classifies microcalcifications into            
suspicious or not, and (d) highlights the suspicious

"DESCRIPTION (Taken from application abstract):  The long term goal of the       
work described in this proposal is to develop on-line combined spatial and      
symbolic methods for representing, storing, retrieving and visualizing          
anatomical information, both as a means for understanding human biological      
structure, and as a visual gateway into the rapidly increasing array of         
on-line text-based information sources in biomedicine.  In this proposal we     
will address some of the fundamental problems involved in combining spatial     
and symbolic anatomic information, and will test solutions to these problems    
in a World Wide Web based 3-D anatomy information system for the thoracic       
viscera.  Clinicians, researchers and students will be able to use this         
system to retrieve specific anatomic knowledge, in the form of                  
dynamically-generated interactive 3-D scenes and corresponding symbolic         
information, without the need to consult hard copy atlases or to navigate       
through irrelevant computer-based images before finding the needed              
information.  In order to build this system we will need to address             
fundamental problems in spatial modeling, organization of these models in a     
knowledge based spatial database system, and access to the models via an        
on-line user interface and spatial query processor.  The specific aims for      
this proposal are:  1) develop a knowledge base that organizes and              
integrates spatial and symbolic models of anatomy, 2) implement an anatomy      
information system that combines knowledge-based spatial and symbolic           
retrieval with dynamically generated 3-D scenes, 3) develop methods for         
smoothly rendering and interacting with the scene in real-time, and 4)          
evaluate the system by integrating other spatial data and by providing it to    
anatomy medical students and radiation treatment planners.  Accomplishment      
of these aims will lead to a useful information system for the anatomy of       
the thoracic viscera that can be enhanced with new technology such as high      
performance graphics and virtual reality.  Moreover, the information            
framework and methods we establish in this project will be generalizable not    
only to gross anatomy in different regions of the body and to different         
anatomical databases, but also to the management of structural information
