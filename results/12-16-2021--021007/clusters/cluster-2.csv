"The genes of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region control a variety         
Of functions involved in the immune response, and influence                     
susceptibility to over 40 diseases.  Our understanding of the structure         
and function of the HLA genes, their disease associations, and the              
evolutionary features of this multigene family has benefitted from recent       
advances in molecular biology, immunology, disease modelling and                
population genetics.  Theoretical studies in the development of models to       
determine the modes of inheritance of the HLA associated diseases have          
led to a better understanding of the inheritance patterns in insulin            
dependent diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,          
ankylosing spondylitis, hemochromatosis, celiac disease, and others.  It        
is now clear that many of the HLA associated diseases involve                   
heterogeneity in their HLA components, as well as non-HLA genetic               
components.                                                                     
                                                                                
The specific aims of our research are to study the genetic components in        
the etiology of the HLA associated diseases, and population genetic             
features of the HLA system.  A variety of methods to test modes of              
inheritance of diseases using marker allele information, will be                
developed.  Methods appropriate for the analysis of marker systems which        
are not highly polymorphic, to both detect linkage and determine modes of       
inheritance, will be investigated.  The information content of particular       
pedigree types for LOD score analysis will be investigated.  Two methods        
using patterns of linkage disequilibrium will be investigated to                
determine their usefulness in mapping disease predisposing genes.  A            
number of large collaborative data sets of HLA associated diseases will         
be analyzed.  A framework for genetic counselling of HLA associated, and        
other complex diseases, will be developed.  The results of our studies

"The amino acid sequence of a protein uniquely determines its tertiary           
structure. Deciphering this relationship, the protein folding problem has       
become increasingly important to molecular biologists. DNA sequencing has       
become routine, but structural experiments remain very difficult.               
Computational strategies are needed to help address this problem.               
                                                                                
This proposal describes a strategy to identify the location of alpha-           
helices and beta-strands throughout the sequence. A method for using off-       
lattice simulations of a polypeptide chain to identify secondary structure      
preferences in the ensemble average is proposed. Once secondary structure       
is located, computational methods exist for generating plausible tertiary       
structures. However, these combinatorial strategies give rise to a large        
number of alternative structures which are difficult to distinguish from        
the correct fold. Experimental and theoretical methods for clarifying the       
distinction between correctly folded structures and their misfolded

In a new direction, we propose to develop a multiple sequence analysis          
strategy to relate sequence and structure to function. In particular, we        
will focus on identifying the binding sites on the G-alpha family of            
GTPases for the relevant G-protein coupled receptors, G-beta-gamma and          
downstream effectors. We plan to continue to develop a genetic algorithm        
for the construction of polypeptide loops subject to a series of                
constraints. This method will be used to model the loop regions of G-           
protein coupled receptors involved in the interaction with peptide ligands      
and the hetero-trimeric G-protein complex.                                      
                                                                                
Finally, we propose to develop a new method to compare structures based on      
the area of the minimal ""soap film"" that could join them following the          
appropriate rotation and translation of one structure relative to another.      
This provides a natural way to circumvent the gap penalty problem that          
plagues current structure alignment algorithms.

sleep regulation in the developmental psychobiology of affective disorders.     
The first goal is to extend a well-established line of research based on        
measures of EEG sleep and cortisol in child and adolescent depression by        
investigating:  (1) abnormalities in sleep and cortisol regulation focusing     
on the sleep-onset transition; (2) normal maturational changes in sleep and     
cortisol regulation relevant to these abnormalities; and (3) the predictive     
validity of sleep and cortisol abnormalities in longitudinal clinical           
follow-up.                                                                      
                                                                                
The second goal is to further develop and investigate a larger developmental    
model of sleep regulation.  The model emphasizes close links between sleep      
regulation and neurobehavioral systems involved in the regulation of affect     
and arousal which are modulated in regions of prefrontal cortex (PFC).          
Matur-ational changes in PFC-subcortical circuits influencing sleep,

wakefulness into sleep.  Based on this model, predictions are made regarding    
sleep changes in the development of affective disorders and effects of sleep    
deprivation of affective regulation.  The long-term goal of this work is to     
understand mechanisms of dysregulation which may lead to more effective
