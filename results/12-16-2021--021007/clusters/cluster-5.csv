"We propose to design, implement, and test an intelligent, interactive,          
electronic assistant for crystallographers that will facilitate the             
trial-and-error process of growing crystals of biological macromolecules.       
The Assistant collects and analyzes laboratory data as well as historical       
data at the laboratory bench itself. The tasks performed by the Assistant       
include (a) unobtrusive recording of experimental context and maintaining       
an archive of crystallization experiments, (b) answering questions about        
experimental protocols, retrieving and analyzing experiments relevant to        
new crystallization attempts, (c) performing chemical calculations and          
simulations to assist in choice of experimental parameters, as well as          
(d) exploratory data analysis and the induction of causal theories that         
capture regularities in the sizable experimental data on crystal growth.

"This proposal is a response to RFA #CA/HD-93-33, ""Rehabilitation and            
Psychosocial Research in Younger Women with Breast Cancer."" The objectives      
of this research are: 1) to test the benefits of a computer-based support       
system (CHESS, the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System) on the      
quality of life and disability of younger women with breast cancer; and,        
2) to begin to understand how and for what kind of people CHESS has that        
effect. CHESS uses expert systems, computer-mediated communication, data        
bases, and an easy-to-use interface to provide information, decision            
analysis, and social support services to women with breast cancer.              
                                                                                
Three hundred women with breast cancer under age 50 (including 100              
minority women) will be recruited from hospitals in Madison and Chicago         
and will be randomized into control and experimental groups. Subjects will      
include women with breast cancer at Stages I to IV, including recurrent         
breast cancer. A CHESS computer will be placed into the homes of the            
experimental group members for six months, while the control group will         
have access to standard medical practice for patient education and              
support, supplemented by a consistent set of written information on breast      
cancer. Both groups will be surveyed at pre-test, and with 2, 4 and 8           
month post-tests.                                                               
                                                                                
The primary aim of this research is to understand the effect of CHESS on        
quality of -life for women with breast cancer. Specifically, we will            
examine whether access to CHESS produces more rapid and greater                 
improvements in specific quality of life dimensions: functional,                
emotional, social-family, physical, and disease-specific complaints. We         
will also investigate impact of global quality of life as an exploratory        
analysis. The secondary aim is to begin to explore: l) whether CHESS has        
an effect on detailed functional performance and level of disability; and,      
2) how and for what kinds of patients (e.g., minorities, more or less           
educated, stage of disease, etc.) does CHESS have its effects on quality        
of life.
