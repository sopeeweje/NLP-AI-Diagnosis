"The notion of clinical significance permeates evaluations of clinical
 research results, plays an important role in changing physician behavior,
 and enters implicitly into the development of rules for knowledge-based
 computer systems. To date, however, this concept has received no formal
 examination and is left to the intuition of the reasoning agent:. The aims
 of this project are (1) to explore the role that clinical significance
 plays in physicians' evaluation of clinical-research results; (2) to
 propose formal methods that satisfy those roles; (3) to create a computer-
 based system that would implement those methods; and (4) to validate the
 proposed methods. As the test domain, we shall focus on the choice between
 two therapies as evaluated in randomized clinical trials.
 
 (1) We shall explore, through a survey process, three central questions
 regarding clinical significance: physicians' perception of its relative
 importance in evaluating study results, physicians' need for assistance in
 its evaluation, and the variability among physicians in its assessment.
 
 (2) We shall determine measures within three formal frameworks for
 expressing the factors that the survey ascertained as important. The
 frameworks are frequentist statistics, Bayesian statistics, and decision
 theory.
 
 The central challenge in applying these formal frameworks and their
 measures into the clinical setting are the difficulty physicians have with
 numerical measures, regardless of framework. To meet this challenge, we
 propose to develop accessible methods for using the frameworks and to
 develop computer-based tools for using the methods.
 
 The strategy we propose for developing accessible methods is to establish
 canonical models within each framework. We plan to propose a set of
 canonical decision models implicit in conclusions of clinical studies and
 to validate the set by a review of a random set of clinical trials gleaned
 from the medical research literature. To use these models, physicians need
 novel nonnumerical methods-graphical and qualitative techniques- that
 translate the statistical results into clinically meaningful terms and
 concepts.
 
 (3) Because these novel methods will be computationally more difficult
 than current practice, we propose to construct a set of computer-based
 tools that will implement them. As basis for building these tools, we
 shall use a set of novel artificial intelligence techniques.
 
 (4) We propose to validate each of the following propositions: that
 clinicians can use these advanced methods, that they prefer one framework
 over the other, and that use of these methods reduces or explains the
 variability established by the questionnaire process.

"We propose to develop automated techniques to facilitate classification         
and pattern recognition in biomedical data sets. These techniques will          
involve development of novel neural network architectures, as well as           
formulation of principles governing their creation and explanation of           
results. Specifically, as a solution to the problem of recognizing              
infrequent categories, we will develop hierarchical and sequential              
systems of feedforward neural networks that make use of information such        
as (a) prior knowledge of the domain, and/or (b) natural clusters               
defined by clustering or unsupervised learning methods to develop               
intermediate classification goals and utilize a divide-and-conquer              
approach to complex classification problems. Additionally, we will              
develop generic tools for pre-processing input data by making                   
transformations of original data, reducing dimensionality, and producing        
training and test sets suitable for cross-validation and bootstrap. We          
will build tools for evaluating results that measure calibration,               
resolution, importance of variables, and comparisons between different          
models. Furthermore, we will develop standardized interfaces for certain        
existing classification models.We will use a component-based                    
architecture to build our neural network and write interfaces to                
existing classification models (e.g., regression trees, logistic                
regression models) so that they can be interchanged in a user-friendly          
manner. We will use our preprocessing modules to prepare data to be             
entered in a variety of classification models. The results will be              
evaluated in isolation, and later combined to test the hypothesis that          
the combined system performs better in real biomedical data sets in             
terms of calibration, resolution, and explanatory power.This research           
will (a) quantify improvement in performance when a classification              
problem is broken down into sub-problems in a systematic way, (b)               
quantify the advantages of combining different types of classifiers, (c)        
create a library of reusable neural network classification models, data         
pre-processing, and evaluation tools that uses standardized interfaces,         
and (d) foster dissemination of classification models and the use of            
pre-processing and evaluation tools by making them available to other           
researchers through the World-Wide-Web. We will test four hypotheses:           
(I) Combinations of different modalities of classifiers perform                 
significantly better than isolated models. (2) Hierarchical and                 
sequential neural networks perform better than standard neural networks.        
(3) Unsupervised models can decompose a problem for hierarchical or             
sequential neural networks better than models that use prior knowledge.         
(4) It is possible to build a Classification Tool Kit composed of data          
preprocessing modules, classification models, and evaluation modules in         
which components are independent, reusable, and interchangeable.
