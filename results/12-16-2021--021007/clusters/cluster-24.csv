"This application is a request for a NIH Research Scientist Development
 Award, Level II RSDA-II) to extend work supported under the RSDA-I
 previously awarded to the applicant (DA00139).  (The RSDA-I granted in 1989
 was titled ""Innovative Statistical Approaches to Drug Abuse Data""; this
 application for the RSDA-II is titled ""Drug Abuse: Epidemiology, Treatment
 Processes, and Outcomes."") The RSDA-Il will continue to ensure financial
 stability and release time from the pursuit of funding for actual research
 work.  The major focus for the applicant during this five-year award is
 continuation of her professional work examining drug use epidemiology and
 treatment interventions for problematic drug abuse. Examining the
 implications of research findings for treatment strategies and developing
 the necessary social policy changes to support the implementation of
 improved treatment strategies is of further interest. The applicant will
 continue her professional work applying innovative statistical
 methodologies to drug abuse data. To this end, three convergent lines of
 current research will be continued. The first examines drug use and
 treatment utilization among subjects recruited through hospital emergency
 rooms sexually transmitted disease clinics, and jails.  The second project
 is to improve the efficacy and efficiency of matching drug users' treatment
 needs to services. The third involves examining and evaluating the process
 of treatment service delivery with a special focus on the roles and
 functions of drug treatment counselors.
 
 The applicant's supporting institution is a research unit, the
 Neuropsychiatric Institute (NPI), organized within the Department of
 Psychiatry, School of Medicine, UCLA. Affiliated with the NPI is the UCLA
 Drug Abuse Research Center, which has been conducting research in drug
 abuse epidemiology natural history of narcotics addiction, treatment
 evaluation, and social policy over the past 20 years.  In this setting, the
 applicant will conduct the proposed research and will receive additional
 training in psychiatric aspects of drug abuse treatment and in the
 implementation of treatment services.  Furthermore. the applicant's
 considerable psychosocial research knowledge and skills in drug abuse
 issues will contribute to the NPI's general program in drug abuse research
 by complementing the Institute's biobehavioral perspective.
 
 During the award period, the applicant also expects to grow professionally
 as Associate Director of the UCLA Drug Abuse Research Center. in addition
 to pursuing the aforementioned research. activities will include the career
 development of new investigators from various disciplines and the mentoring
 of graduate and undergraduate students in related fields.

"DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the applicant's abstract) This project               
proposes a biosensor for the detection of DNA fragments specific to HIV.        
The sensing element will be an interdigitated array (IDA) having single         
stranded DNA immobilized between the array's digits. Immobilized DNA            
strands will be complimentary to a conserved sequence in the HIV target         
thus allowing selective detection. Electronics capable of measuring             
impedance changes will be the detection of the hybridization of                 
complementary DNA strands. Impedance spectroscopy, i.e., multiple               
frequency impedance measurements, will be used to completely characterize       
the sensor's response. The resulting impedance spectrum will be treated         
by Neural Network Analysis (NNA) to isolate the hybridized DNA response         
from non-specifically adsorbed species and other matrix effects. The            
technological innovations which will result from the project include a          
sensitive and specific HIV DNA detection scheme which would be applicable       
to any DNA assay.

"The end goal of research in natural language processing is to provide a         
psychologically plausible computational account of human language               
processing. To this end, cross-linguistic investigation of sentence             
processing can provide critically significant results which elucidate the       
interaction between the grammars of particular languages and the                
mechanisms of human language processing system. In the proposed research,       
one critical aspect of sentence processing, namely, how speakers of             
Japanese and English deal with temporal ambiguities that are encountered        
during on-line processing of a sentence.                                        
                                                                                
In particular, we ask how speakers of Japanese deal with a high degree of       
indeterminacy early in the sentence. In order to investigate whether            
Japanese speakers are engaged in extensive reanalyses en route to a             
correct interpretation, five types of sentences are proposed to be              
examined: sentences with relative clauses; sentences with stative verbs;        
passive and causative sentences; sentences with verbs of giving and             
receiving; and sentences with lexical homonymy. These sentences all             
contain structures that might trigger reanalysis. Syntactic reanalysis of       
grammatical relations as well as reanalysis of thematic role assignments        
will be examined. The sentences will be tested by three psycholinguistic        
experiments: eye-movement monitoring; self-paced reading methods; and on-       
line grammaticality judgement task. Two questionnaires concerning peoples'      
subjective judgments of conscious reanalysis and difficulty of the              
sentence will also be conducted to supplement the experimental data.            
                                                                                
The results of the Japanese studies will then be contrasted to English          
data (available in the literature) to ask whether the ways in which             
Japanese speakers process temporal ambiguity are similar to that of             
English speakers. Using these cross-linguistic results, we will address         
the question of whether a single mechanism can account for the way              
speakers of Japanese and English deal with temporal ambiguity, or

"DESCRIPTION (adapted from applicant's abstract):  A central issue in            
behavioral neuroscience is how alterations in neural pathways mediate the       
durable behavior changes involved in learning.  Taste aversion conditioning     
is an excellent model for studying the neural changes involved in learning      
because this conditioning can occur in a single trial, despite lengthy          
delays between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli.  The proposed studies     
are based on the identification of a cellular correlate of the behavioral       
expression of a conditioned taste aversion, namely, cells in the nucleus of     
the solitary tract.  C-fos induction occurs in cells in the nucleus of the      
solitary tract in response to a taste made aversive by conditioning, but not    
in response to the same taste prior to conditioning or to a taste (quinine)     
which is innately aversive.  Proposed studies will combine this cellular        
measure with behavioral assessment to further assess the cellular c-fos         
response and its reliability as a marker of learning.  Studies will also        
examine the functional importance of cells in the nucleus of the solitary       
tract which display c-fos induction during expression of this learning,         
using asymmetrical lesion techniques.  Additionally, studies will continue      
to define the forebrain pathways critical to this learning, with a focus on     
ipsilateral connections between the amygdala and the nucleus of the solitary    
tract which appear necessary for cellular, as well as behavioral,               
manifestations of this learning.  The role of insular cortex will also be       
examined.  Finally, studies will identify the targets of activated modified     
behavioral response to a taste after conditioning.  By defining the neural
