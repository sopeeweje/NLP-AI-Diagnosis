"This renewal application for Project Years 4-6 proposes continuation of         
the development of new computer algorithms for reasoning about time-            
varying data from underlying causal models. The signals consist of two or       
more channels of events, each event having several properties including         
time of occurrence and event shape class. The models can be represented as      
graphs in which the nodes are digital components, some of which give rise       
to observable events. The arcs are physical connections associated with         
time delays. The application domain is the electrocardiogram, in which the      
P waves and QRS complexes represent two event channels, and optional            
intracardiac recordings contribute additional channels. The P waves and         
QRS complexes are the results of the all-or-nothing depolarization of the       
atria and ventricles, respectively. These cardiac structures are connected      
anatomically and functionally by a series of other structures, each             
associated with a characteristic conduction time.                               
                                                                                
This application builds on the results of Project Years 1-2, in which an        
analytic approach based on a variation of the hypothesize-and-test              
paradigm was used with a hierarchy of models to track the events in the         
cardiac rhythm on an event-by-event basis. The output of the system is one      
or more complete causal explanations of the observed signal, expressed in       
the standard clinical ladder diagram format and consisting of an                
instantiated model and event-by-event annotation of causality based on the      
model. When a signal admits of more than one explanatory model, each is         
developed and displayed separately. The initial hypothesis, that a cardiac      
arrhythmia monitor constructed using knowledge-based programming methods        
can perform substantially better than current clinical arrhythmia               
monitors, has largely been confirmed.                                           
                                                                                
The hypothesis to be tested in this proposal is that the programming            
techniques being used not only can perform better qualitatively than do         
current clinical arrhythmia monitors, but that they can do so at a level        
of performance that is likely to become suitable for the clinical use.          
This hypothesis will be tested in a trial comparing the program with            
physicians at several levels of experience.                                     
                                                                                
This project is attractive for two reasons. First, it offers new                
knowledge-based algorithms for model-based reasoning about time-varying         
signals. This is an unsolved problem in the expert systems field. Second,       
current cardiac arrhythmia monitors do not perform nearly as well as do         
expert nurses, technicians, and physicians. The proposed project will           
contribute to the development of an improved generation of arrhythmia

with disorders of the heart rhythm, particularly in medically underserved

understanding neuronal functions have led to an expanded scientific interest

the Human Brain Project, an ambitious multi disciplinary effort to map the      
nervous system from the organismal to the macromolecular levels.  One of the    
greatest challenges of this effort is to preserve the complex                   
three-dimensional relationships that occur between neuronal structures.

The project described here is an interdisciplinary effort to derive             
three-dimensional reconstructions of synaptic architecture from stereo

combines advanced ultrastructural visualization techniques with massively

integrate structural information from numerous images into a single,            
high-accuracy three-dimensional reconstruction of the synaptic cytoskeleton.    
The immediate result of this collaboration will be an improved understanding    
of the spatial relationships between synaptic macromolecules.  More             
importantly, the project will produce a set of computational tools that can

"The goal of the proposed research is the analysis of biological sequence        
data to address the molecular mechanisms of evolution and the origin(s)

capabilities of MIDAS will be extended to knowledge-based construction          
of Markov decision models. A second project will develop a comprehensive        
knowledge management scheme for the problem of pulmonary disease in AIDS.       
This scheme will use a knowledge base structured according to knowledge         
needed to perform a decision analysis. It will incorporate summaries of         
relevant data, sources and quality of data and links to the original            
sources. This knowledge management scheme will be deployed in the               
hospital and evaluated in a group of medical residents at Robert Wood           
Johnson University Hospital.

"DESCRIPTION:  (Adapted from the applicant's abstract) Impressive advances in    
computer technology have opened the way to the simulation in machina of         
complex biological systems.  In immunology, this has proven helpful as it       
can foster both critical phases of generating and testing novel hypotheses.     
At variance with ""conventional"" models based upon differential equations,       
the applicant has reproduced the dynamics of the humoral response by means      
of cellular automata, where discrete entities cooperate and develop             
according to elementary local rules.                                            
                                                                                
The success of this model in tackling several ""hot"" aspects currently           
debated among immunologists signals that the time is ripe for the

The subject of this proposal is a computer simulation of the immune response    
to viral infection and to foreign cells.  This requires an extensive            
upgrading of our IMMSIM code, including the introduction of infective           
antigens, target cells, dendritic cells, CD8 T cell receptors and class I       
MHCs.  The body is represented by a bi-dimensional space subdivided into        
sites where all interactions take place in discrete time steps.                 
Interactions are probablistic occurrences between cells that take place via     
their receptors, on the basis of complementarity between binary bit strings.    
These interactions may lead to destruction, presentation, stimulation or        
tolerance.  As in the living organism, a virus-specific Tc precursor will       
become anergic by meeting a Class I-bearing infected target cell but will       
mature to a serial killer upon binding to a DC that has attracted a Th cell,    
whose lymphokines will act on both Tc and DC.                                   
                                                                                
The outcome of each event depends on a number of parameters of largely          
unknown biological weight.  Their effects will be tested experimentally by      
running the same response serially, varying one parameter at a time, and        
comparing the results to ascertained immunological behaviors.  This will        
allow us to identify the critical nodes of the virus/response progress and      
then to use the model to challenge further fundamental aspects, such as         
viral mutation, lymphoid cell infection, and, ultimately, the                   
cooperative/competitive interplay between the cellular and humoral response
