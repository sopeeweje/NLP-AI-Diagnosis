"New prosthetic methods are giving people with motor impairments
 alternative communication and control channels.  A logical culmination of
 these developments is a system that allows the brain to bypass completely
 its normal output pathways.  Recent studies from this laboratory have
 shown that humans, including those with motor disabilities, can learn to
 change rapidly and accurately the amplitude of the 8-12 Hz mu rhythm in
 the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded over sensorimotor cortex.
 Furthermore, they can use this control to move a cursor on a computer
 screen.  Good single-channel control has been obtained, and initial data
 indicate that multichannel control is also possible.  Thus, the mu
 rhythm, which recent work shows is detectable in nearly all adults, may
 support a multichannel brain-to-computer interface, and thereby provide a
 powerful new communication and control option for severely disabled
 individuals.
 
 This project's goal is a reliable multichannel brain-computer interface.
 The proposed approach is based on three well-supported hypotheses: that
 the scalp-recorded 8-12 Hz mu rhythm comprises a number of relatively
 independent components, that topographic analysis and frequency analysis
 techniques can distinguish between these components, and that humans can
 learn to control specific components and use them to operate a
 multichannel brain-computer interface.
 
 The first objective is to define by topography and frequency the separate
 8-12 Hz components that are present when individuals are using the
 current interface.  The second objective is to determine which components
 individuals are best able to control.  The third objective is to
 incorporate these trainable components into a multichannel brain-computer
 interface that is rapid and reliable.  These objectives will be achieved
 by combining online studies in which subjects learn to use the interface
 while extensive data are stored, and offline data analyses in which
 methods for improving the interface are defined.
 
 This project should produce an EEG-based brain-computer interface of
 significant value to individuals with disabilities.  It should also lead
 to further work exploring the practical capabilities and theoretical
 implications of this new form of communication.

"The genes of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region control a variety
 Of functions involved in the immune response, and influence
 susceptibility to over 40 diseases.  Our understanding of the structure
 and function of the HLA genes, their disease associations, and the
 evolutionary features of this multigene family has benefitted from recent
 advances in molecular biology, immunology, disease modelling and
 population genetics.  Theoretical studies in the development of models to
 determine the modes of inheritance of the HLA associated diseases have
 led to a better understanding of the inheritance patterns in insulin
 dependent diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,
 ankylosing spondylitis, hemochromatosis, celiac disease, and others.  It
 is now clear that many of the HLA associated diseases involve
 heterogeneity in their HLA components, as well as non-HLA genetic
 components.
 
 The specific aims of our research are to study the genetic components in
 the etiology of the HLA associated diseases, and population genetic
 features of the HLA system.  A variety of methods to test modes of
 inheritance of diseases using marker allele information, will be
 developed.  Methods appropriate for the analysis of marker systems which
 are not highly polymorphic, to both detect linkage and determine modes of
 inheritance, will be investigated.  The information content of particular
 pedigree types for LOD score analysis will be investigated.  Two methods
 using patterns of linkage disequilibrium will be investigated to
 determine their usefulness in mapping disease predisposing genes.  A
 number of large collaborative data sets of HLA associated diseases will
 be analyzed.  A framework for genetic counselling of HLA associated, and
 other complex diseases, will be developed.  The results of our studies
 are generally applicable to the mapping and characterization of complex
 human genetic traits.

"The prediction of the three dimensional structure of a globular protein
 from its amino acid sequence along with the mechanism by which protein
 folding occurs are among the most important unsolved problems of
 contemporary molecular biology.  The overall objectives of this proposal
 are the continued development and refinement of algorithms which not only
 can predict protein tertiary structure using only sequence information as
 input but also may provide insights into the folding pathway.  To achieve
 these goals, this proposal focuses on the lattice based aspects of a
 hierarchical approach to protein folding.  High resolution lattice models
 of proteins, comprised of an alpha-carbon plus reduced off lattice, side
 chain description, will provide the overall folding pathways and folded
 conformations.  The resulting folded lattice structures are estimated for
 the alpha-carbons to have a 2-4 angstroms rms deviation from the native
 state.  Turning to the folding pathways, the predicted molten globule
 states and their free energy landscape will be characterized in detail.
 The factors responsible for side chain fixation on passage from the molten
 globule to the native state will be explored, with particular attention
 focused on the interplay of protein sequence and side chain packing.
 Specifically this proposal will address the following.  (1).  A new high
 coordination lattice model of proteins will be refined, different side
 chain realizations will be examined and the dynamic Monte Carlo algorithms
 parallelized.  (2).  Better empirical free energy functions will be
 developed.  These include better methods for predicting the propensities
 for secondary structure and generalization of the hydrogen bond scheme to
 include backbone-side chain hydrogen bonds.  To help eliminate misfolded
 structures, additional very robust knowledge based rules, such as the
 connections in supersecondary structural elements do not cross, will be
 included in the interaction scheme.  Sequence specific tertiary
 interactions including a local burial turn, pair interactions and
 generalized cooperative multibody side chain contact templates will be
 self consistently derived in the presence of predicted secondary structure
 propensities.  Then, a recently developed neural network which can
 recognize whether 7 by 7 subfragments of sidechain contact maps are
 protein like or not will be extended to include sequence specific
 preferences for subsequences to adopt specific patterns.  This information
 will be obtained from a neural network trained on both homologous and non
 homologous subsequences that adopt these patterns.  Thus, it should be
 general and not simply applicable to homologous sequence fragments.  (3).
 The folding of representative motifs of globular proteins will be
 undertaken.  Included are the helical proteins such as cytochrome c, whose
 predicted folding pathway will be compared to experiment, myohemerythrin,
 myoglobin and complement factor, 1c5a.  The mixed motif proteins include
 ubiquitin, flavodoxin and PRA isomerase, and the beta-proteins include the
 16th complement control protein of factor H, 1hcc, alpha-amylase,
 plastocyanin and retinol binding protein.  (4).  To validate the
 methodology, additional blind predictions of proteins whose structures are
 unknown will be undertaken.  Likely candidates include rusticyanin and
 erythropoietin.

"DESCRIPTION (Taken from application abstract):  The long term goal of the       
work described in this proposal is to develop on-line combined spatial and      
symbolic methods for representing, storing, retrieving and visualizing          
anatomical information, both as a means for understanding human biological      
structure, and as a visual gateway into the rapidly increasing array of         
on-line text-based information sources in biomedicine.  In this proposal we     
will address some of the fundamental problems involved in combining spatial     
and symbolic anatomic information, and will test solutions to these problems    
in a World Wide Web based 3-D anatomy information system for the thoracic       
viscera.  Clinicians, researchers and students will be able to use this         
system to retrieve specific anatomic knowledge, in the form of                  
dynamically-generated interactive 3-D scenes and corresponding symbolic         
information, without the need to consult hard copy atlases or to navigate       
through irrelevant computer-based images before finding the needed              
information.  In order to build this system we will need to address             
fundamental problems in spatial modeling, organization of these models in a     
knowledge based spatial database system, and access to the models via an        
on-line user interface and spatial query processor.  The specific aims for      
this proposal are:  1) develop a knowledge base that organizes and              
integrates spatial and symbolic models of anatomy, 2) implement an anatomy      
information system that combines knowledge-based spatial and symbolic           
retrieval with dynamically generated 3-D scenes, 3) develop methods for         
smoothly rendering and interacting with the scene in real-time, and 4)          
evaluate the system by integrating other spatial data and by providing it to    
anatomy medical students and radiation treatment planners.  Accomplishment      
of these aims will lead to a useful information system for the anatomy of       
the thoracic viscera that can be enhanced with new technology such as high      
performance graphics and virtual reality.  Moreover, the information            
framework and methods we establish in this project will be generalizable not    
only to gross anatomy in different regions of the body and to different         
anatomical databases, but also to the management of structural information

"DESCRIPTION:  (Adapted from the applicant's abstract):  Medical and             
biological data often come in the form of digitized signals and images, for     
example magnetic resonance images (MRI), ion channel electrical series, and     
human gait paths.  As data acquisition becomes easier, sequences of such        
images or signals are collected, often along with other covariate               
measurements, resulting in data sets where the basic unit of measurement or     
response is a high dimensional object.  This project proposes a battery of      
statistical techniques for modeling and understanding such data, that           
explicitly takes into account and indeed exploits the inherent, spatial, or     
temporal correlation, and when appropriate, relates it to covariate             
information.  By imposing spatial smoothness in the image or signal domain,     
pixel-wise regression, and canonical correlation models can borrow strength     
from neighboring pixels.  This not only improves the overall efficiency of      
these techniques, but also allows identification of important regions rather    
than individual pixels.  The project develops appropriate versions of           
nonparametric regressions for such series of images, as well as data            
descriptions such as clustering, principal component, and singular value

"There is growing recognition that, while practice guidelines can                
predispose physicians to behavioral change, even the most respected and         
clinically relevant guidelines often do not affect actual practice.             
Despite the apparent reluctance of physicians to incorporate published          
practice guidelines into their clinical routine, there are signs that           
immediate automated reminders can have a profound influence on physician        
behavior, and on the cost and quality of medical care. As practice              
guidelines proliferate and become more complex, the dilemma facing those

comprehensiveness of the guidelines and the likelihood they will be             
retained and implemented by the physicians for whom they are intended.          
This same complexity can complicate computer-based implementation of            
guidelines. For example, the dependence of guidelines on patient                
preferences and individual risk factors makes the rule-based approach

complex, flexible guidelines tailored to varying clinical circumstances.        
These systems provide advice based on a tailored decision-analytic model.

The goal of this work is to develop and test improved explanation methods

be used in a consultative mode. We have developed a program called QxQ,         
which uses symbolic reasoning to provide qualitative text explanations for      
the results of decision trees. This work is intended to extract the key         
architecture- and domain-independent elements of QxQ's methodology, and to      
reimplement and test them as part of MIDAS, an existing IDS. First, we          
will develop a domain- and system-independent version of QxQ, called EQxQ       
(for essential QxQ), by applying it to decision models constructed in           
MIDAS. In collaboration with the developers of MIDAS, we will identify the      
key independent elements necessary to generate explanations from an IDS.        
Second, we will devise and implement additional explanation methods in          
EQxQ to allow explanation of complex modeling constructs, such as Markov        
models, cycle trees, and cost-effectiveness models. Third, we will test         
the robustness of the MIDAS-EQxQ system by using it to implement a              
decision model underlying a clinically relevant practice guideline.

"DESCRIPTION (Adapted from applicant's abstract):  Visuomotor integration        
depends on a remarkable coherence among a number of interrelated                
subprocesses such as pattern recognition, pattern discrimination, decision      
to move, and guidance of movement.  The brain is able to integrate these        
elementary cognitive processes by coordinating the activities of diverse        
neural structures in the face of continuously varying processing demands.       
The question of how this coordination operates is central to understanding      
the neural basis of visuomotor function.  This proposal aims to develop new     
analytical tools to investigate the coordinated activity of distributed         
neuronal ensembles in the cerebral cortex of humans and non-human primates      
performing simple visuomotor tasks.  It is motivated by recent theoretical      
developments (Bressler 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997) predicting a general         
cortical mechanism allowing the flexible large-scale functional coordination    
of interacting neuronal ensembles.  Hypotheses concerning this mechanism        
will be tested by analysis of field potential data recorded at NIMH from        
macaque monkeys performing a visuomotor pattern recognition task.  The          
challenge is to develop and test new analytic approaches that characterize      
the multiple, complex interactions of large-scale distributed cortical          
networks.  Earlier analysis of a small portion of this NIMH data set,           
reported in Nature in 1993, revealed shifting patterns of multi-site            
cortical synchronization during visuomotor processing, and implicated           
synchronization in the formation of functional relations within and between     
cortical areas.  Standard pairwise techniques were employed to measure          
synchronization between field potential signals.  Here, novel methods of        
time-series analysis are proposed that go beyond the simple detection of        
network interactions.  Advances in signal processing technology will be         
utilized to also derive multi-site interaction patterns, to analyze the         
dependencies of functional relations on particular groups of neurons, and to    
measure the flow of information between cortical regions.  This                 
collaborative project will draw on the complementary strengths of Drs.          
Bressler and Ding.  Dr. Bressler brings to the project over 15 years of         
experience in cognitive neuroscience, with expertise in the recording and       
analysis of neuroelectric data from humans to animals.  He will provide         
theoretical oversight and the application of analytic tools to the field        
potential data set.  Dr. Ding, although relatively new to cognitive             
neuroscience, has over 10 years of experience in linear and nonlinear           
dynamical systems analysis.  He will provide the development of new             
analytical methods from a comprehensive dynamical systems perspective.  This    
work is expected to (1) produce new insights into the dynamics of cortical      
information flow in visual perception and motor performance, (2) make           
available new digital signal processing tools for the investigation of large    
scale neural systems underlying other cognitive functions and, (3) provide a    
fresh perspective on the design of complex architectures for the execution      
of cognitive tasks by artificial neural network systems.
