"Visual mental imagery helps people to perform a host of tasks, including
 remembering events, spatial reasoning, and language comprehension. The
 images produced in the service of these activities are the result of a
 complex information processing system. This system can be conceptualized
 as being composed of a set of distinct ""processing subsystems,"" each of
 which performs a specific cognitive operation (e.g., shifting the
 orientation of an imaged object, activating stored visual memories to
 create an image, encoding the relative location of part of the imaged
 object). The research described here makes use of a theory of these
 processing subsystems that draws on concepts from artificial intelligence
 and facts about the neurological substrate of high.level vision. The
 research will characterize the relative efficacy of eleven of these
 subsystems in the elderly, compared to younger adults. The primary aim
 of the research is to discover whether certain subsystems are, relative
 to other subsystems, selectively more effective in senescence. The
 research aims to disprove the idea that cognitive aging can be understood
 solely in terms of ""generalized slowing,"" showing that slowing with age
 differs for different subsystems. If so, then strategies that make use
 of relatively effective subsystems should be more useful for elderly
 people than strategies that rely on ineffective subsystems. The
 experiments designed here are a step toward using contemporary theory
 from cognitive neuroscience and techniques of task analysis from
 cognitive science to design new tests for cognitive efficiency in the
 senescence.

"The prediction of the three dimensional structure of a globular protein         
from its amino acid sequence along with the mechanism by which protein          
folding occurs are among the most important unsolved problems of                
contemporary molecular biology.  The overall objectives of this proposal        
are the continued development and refinement of algorithms which not only       
can predict protein tertiary structure using only sequence information as       
input but also may provide insights into the folding pathway.  To achieve       
these goals, this proposal focuses on the lattice based aspects of a            
hierarchical approach to protein folding.  High resolution lattice models       
of proteins, comprised of an alpha-carbon plus reduced off lattice, side        
chain description, will provide the overall folding pathways and folded         
conformations.  The resulting folded lattice structures are estimated for       
the alpha-carbons to have a 2-4 angstroms rms deviation from the native         
state.  Turning to the folding pathways, the predicted molten globule           
states and their free energy landscape will be characterized in detail.         
The factors responsible for side chain fixation on passage from the molten      
globule to the native state will be explored, with particular attention         
focused on the interplay of protein sequence and side chain packing.            
Specifically this proposal will address the following.  (1).  A new high        
coordination lattice model of proteins will be refined, different side          
chain realizations will be examined and the dynamic Monte Carlo algorithms      
parallelized.  (2).  Better empirical free energy functions will be             
developed.  These include better methods for predicting the propensities        
for secondary structure and generalization of the hydrogen bond scheme to       
include backbone-side chain hydrogen bonds.  To help eliminate misfolded        
structures, additional very robust knowledge based rules, such as the           
connections in supersecondary structural elements do not cross, will be         
included in the interaction scheme.  Sequence specific tertiary                 
interactions including a local burial turn, pair interactions and               
generalized cooperative multibody side chain contact templates will be          
self consistently derived in the presence of predicted secondary structure      
propensities.  Then, a recently developed neural network which can              
recognize whether 7 by 7 subfragments of sidechain contact maps are             
protein like or not will be extended to include sequence specific               
preferences for subsequences to adopt specific patterns.  This information      
will be obtained from a neural network trained on both homologous and non       
homologous subsequences that adopt these patterns.  Thus, it should be          
general and not simply applicable to homologous sequence fragments.  (3).       
The folding of representative motifs of globular proteins will be               
undertaken.  Included are the helical proteins such as cytochrome c, whose      
predicted folding pathway will be compared to experiment, myohemerythrin,       
myoglobin and complement factor, 1c5a.  The mixed motif proteins include        
ubiquitin, flavodoxin and PRA isomerase, and the beta-proteins include the      
16th complement control protein of factor H, 1hcc, alpha-amylase,               
plastocyanin and retinol binding protein.  (4).  To validate the                
methodology, additional blind predictions of proteins whose structures are      
unknown will be undertaken.  Likely candidates include rusticyanin and          
erythropoietin.

"DESCRIPTION (adapted from the Abstract):  In this research project the          
Principal Investigator proposes to employ an alternative strategy to early

networks of gonorrhea and HIV are similar in the United States and India.       
If this hypothesis is true, then the yield of HIV seropositivity by ELISA       
can be improved by approaching the HIV seropositives through patients

"The overall goal of this research program is to investigate the role of         
parent behavior on the development of repetitive arm, hand, and finger          
movements in young infants-gestures that have recently been studied as          
an analog to infant vocal babble. Specifically, this project will               
investigate the responsiveness of parents to these repetitive infant            
gestures and will experimentally test the role of parental reinforcement        
on their production over time. Taking a Dynamic Systems approach, the           
overall hypothesis is that children are born with innate predispositions        
to produce behaviors that appear to adults as very speech- or sign-like-        
repetitive vocalizations and gestures, respectively. As children mature,        
they have an expanding ""pool' of motor behaviors that may be used in            
various contexts. In contexts where these behaviors are functional (e.g.        
parents respond to and reinforce them), they are maintained and continue        
to pull from the available pool. In contexts where they are not                 
functional, they do not change and eventually drop out. The present             
project will consist of two longitudinal small-sample studies and one           
large-sample study of adult responsiveness to repetitive infant gestures.       
In Study 1 of the present project, the responses of hearing parents to          
repetitive gestures produced by their hearing infants from 6 to 12 months       
of age will be studied and compared to those of deaf, American Sign             
Language (ASL)-signing parents of deaf infants. These data will provide         
information about the natural responses of parents, both hearing and            
deaf, to repetitive babble-like gestures produced by young infants. In          
Study 2, the ability of hearing, nonsigning adults to identify repetitive       
infant gestures from a ""background' of ongoing infant motor activity will       
be assessed. These data will provide new information about the potential        
of hearing adults to recognize babble-like gestures in young infants. In        
Study 3, the effect of parent reinforcement on repetitive infant gestures       
will be experimentally tested by training hearing parents to provide            
social reinforcement for nonreferential repetitive gestures produced by         
their hearing infants between 6 and 16 months of age. These data will

parent behavior on the development of repetitive arm, hand, and finger          
movements in young infants-gestures that have recently been studied as          
an analog to infant vocal babble. Specifically, this project will               
investigate the responsiveness of parents to these repetitive infant            
gestures and will experimentally test the role of parental reinforcement        
on their production over time. Taking a Dynamic Systems approach, the           
overall hypothesis is that children are born with innate predispositions        
to produce behaviors that appear to adults as very speech- or sign-like-        
repetitive vocalizations and gestures, respectively. As children mature,        
they have an expanding ""pool' of motor behaviors that may be used in            
various contexts. In contexts where these behaviors are functional (e.g.        
parents respond to and reinforce them), they are maintained and continue        
to pull from the available pool. In contexts where they are not                 
functional, they do not change and eventually drop out. The present             
project will consist of two longitudinal small-sample studies and one           
large-sample study of adult responsiveness to repetitive infant gestures.       
In Study 1 of the present project, the responses of hearing parents to          
repetitive gestures produced by their hearing infants from 6 to 12 months       
of age will be studied and compared to those of deaf, American Sign             
Language (ASL)-signing parents of deaf infants. These data will provide         
information about the natural responses of parents, both hearing and            
deaf, to repetitive babble-like gestures produced by young infants. In          
Study 2, the ability of hearing, nonsigning adults to identify repetitive       
infant gestures from a ""background' of ongoing infant motor activity will       
be assessed. These data will provide new information about the potential        
of hearing adults to recognize babble-like gestures in young infants. In        
Study 3, the effect of parent reinforcement on repetitive infant gestures       
will be experimentally tested by training hearing parents to provide            
social reinforcement for nonreferential repetitive gestures produced by         
their hearing infants between 6 and 16 months of age. These data will           
inform our models of language learning by examining the role of parent

babble and provide clinically relevant information about gestural parent-

The broad objective of this proposal is to establish a quantitative             
algorithmic link between cellular and molecular events involved in reward       
processing and the behaviors that these events influence.  In particular, we    
will focus on the nature and use of information that midbrain dopamine          
systems construct and distribute to neural structures throughout the brain.     
The activity of dopamine neurons of the ventral segmental area and              
substantia nigra has long been identified with the processing of rewarding      
stimuli.  These neurons send axons to brain structures involved in              
motivation and goal directed behavior.  These same dopamine systems are         
targets for disruption by disease and by drugs of abuse like heroine and        
cocaine.  In alert primates, experiments show that the outputs of these         
neurons encode errors between the predictions of future rewards and actual      
times and magnitudes of future rewards.  The prediction errors are              
apparently encoded as changes in the instantaneous spiking rates:  values       
above baseline mean that the current state is 'better than predicted',          
values below mean that the current state is 'worse than predicted', and no      
difference means that 'things are as predicted'.  We have developed a           
computational model of the behavior of midbrain dopamine neurons using a        
method of adaptive optimizing control called the method of temporal             
differences.  The model is consistent with electrophysiological and             
behavioral data in monkeys, and also provably executes the appropriate          
computational function of determining which actions maximize long-term          
rewards.  The long term goal of this project is to provide a computational      
connection between the action of dopaminergic mechanisms at the molecular       
and cellular level and the consequences of these mechanisms on behaviors        
observed in drug addiction.  Three approaches will be used to accomplish        
this long term goal:  (1) human behavioral experiments, (2) mathematical        
analysis, and (3) computer simulations of virtual creatures in complex          
environments.  These three methods will focus on the function of                
dopaminergic systems in the primate and will be used to probe how normal        
mechanisms for making decisions in the face of rewards can be disrupted in
