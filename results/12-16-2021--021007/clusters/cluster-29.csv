"The goal of the proposed research is to develop computer-aided diagnosis        
(CAD) schemes in order to improve the diagnostic accuracy of breast cancer      
in mammography. Four specific aims are included: (l) development of             
computer programs for the detection and characterization of

accuracy of the CAD programs, and (4) evaluation of the effects of the CAD      
schemes on radiologists' performance. The proposed CAD schemes will aid         
radiologists in screening mammograms for suspicious lesions and provide         
estimate of the likelihood of malignancy for the detected lesions. The          
information is expected to reduce the miss rate and to improve the

microcalcifications and masses will be established. Physical measures           
which characterize the significant image features of the lesions will be        
developed. Based on these measures, linear discriminant classifiers or          
neural network classifiers will be optimized using a genetic algorithm          
approach to classify true and false signals and to estimate the likelihood
