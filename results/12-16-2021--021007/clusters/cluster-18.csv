"DESCRIPTION:  The proposed project will develop a multimedia computer expert system providing smoking cessation assistance to patients and the physicians who treat them.  This system is a practical application for the medical office setting and easily operated by both physicians' and their patients.  The software design incorporates multi-lingual, written, audio, and graphic presentation of assessment questions and answer selection options, rendering it especially accessible to low-literacy and minority (non-English speaking) populations.  These groups have presented a challenge for treatment in that they are often hard to reach, and motivate, have limited resources and have limited access to preventive care.  Increasingly underserved populations are treated through managed care systems where health care provider time is limited.  The proposed expert system will enhance provider capacity to treat smoking by providing individualized assessment of key factors important to smoking cessation, and provide feedback to the physician and individually tailored counseling messages directly to the patient.  Prior work has demonstrated that individualized feedback has superior efficacy to standardized interventions for smoking cessation.  Following programming and initial development, the expert system will be pilot tested for user acceptance in a hospital-based primary care clinic.  artificial intelligence; clinical research; computer assisted diagnosis; computer assisted instruction; computer assisted medical decision making; computer human interaction; computer system design /evaluation; human subject; interactive multimedia; smoking cessation COMPUTER ASSISTED TREATMENT FOR UNDERSERVED SMOKERS","DESCRIPTION:  The proposed project will develop a multimedia computer expert system providing smoking cessation assistance to patients and the physicians who treat them.

"The long-term objective of our research group is to facilitate automatic        
or semi-automatic classification and retrieval of natural language texts,       
in support of reducing the cost and improving the quality of computerized       
medical information. This proposal develops further and applies a novel         
approach, the Linear Least Squares Fit (LLSF) mapping, to document              
indexing and document retrieval of the MEDLINE database. LLSF mapping is        
a statistical method developed by the PI for learning human knowledge           
about matching queries, documents, and canonical concepts. The goal is to       
improve the quality (recall and precision) of automatic document indexing       
and retrieval, which cannot be achieved by surface-based matching without       
using human knowledge or thesaurus-based matching dependent on manually         
developed synonyms. This project applies LLSF to MEDLINE, the world's           
largest and most frequently used on-line database, to evaluate the              
effectiveness of this method and to explore the practical potential on          
large scale databases. The specific aims and methods are:                       
                                                                                
l. To collect data needed for the training and evaluation of the LLSF           
method. A collaboration with another research institute is planned for          
utilizing and refining a large collection of MEDLINE retrieval data. A          
sampling of MEDLINE searches at the Mayo Clinic will be employed for            
obtaining additional tasks.                                                     
                                                                                
2. To develop automatic noise reduction techniques for improving both the       
accuracy of the LLSF mapping and the efficiency of the computation. A           
multi-step noise reduction in the training process of LLSF will be              
investigated, including a statistical term weighting for the removal of         
non-informative terms, a truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) for       
reducing the noise at the semantic structure level, and the truncation of       
insignificant elements in the LLSF solution matrix for noise-reduction at       
the level of term-to-concept mapping.                                           
                                                                                
3. To scale-up the training capacity for enabling the LLSF to accommodate       
the large size of MEDLINE data. A split-merge approach decomposes a large       
training sample into tractable subsets, computes an LLSF mapping function       
for each subset, and then merges the lcal mapping functions into a global       
one.                                                                            
                                                                                
4. To improve the computational efficiency by employing algorithms              
optimized for sparse matrices and for noise reduction. The potential            
solutions include the Block Lanczos truncated SVD algorithm which can           
reduce the cubic time complexity of standard SVD (on dense matrices) to a       
quadratic complexity, a QR decomposition which solves the LLSF without          
SVD, a sparse matrix algorithm which has shown a speed-up in matrix             
multiplication and cosine computation by a factor of l to 4 magnitudes,         
and parallel computing.                                                         
                                                                                
5. To evaluate the effectiveness of LLSF on large MEDLINE document sets         
and compare with the performance of alternate indexing/retrieval systems.

The most intractable and disturbing human behavior disorders involve the        
systems for memory and learning.  The proposed work is intended to              
increase our basic understanding of how these systems work , hence aid          
in the search for means to eliminate or alleviate memory and learning           
disorders.
