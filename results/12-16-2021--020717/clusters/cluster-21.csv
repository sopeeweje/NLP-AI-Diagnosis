"Changes in soft tissue elasticity are usually related to pathological           
processes.  Because of this, palpation is still widely used for                 
diagnosis.  Its efficacy, however, is limited to abnormalities located          
relatively close to the skin surface.  The goal of quantitative                 
elasticity imaging is to develop surrogate, remote palpation, thus              
expanding its range to include deep lying lesions.  The elastic                 
properties of any continuous medium such as tissue can be assessed              
through precise measurement of mechanical deformations throughout that          
medium induced by forces applied at the surface.  Using modern medical          
imaging devices to precisely measure internal motion, it should be              
possible to estimate and even image elastic properties of internal              
organs.  In competition with other imaging modalities, ultrasound has two       
major advantages for elasticity imaging; it is inherently real-time and         
speckle artifacts limiting the quality of conventional images provide           
excellent markers for accurate tracking of tissue motion.  Elasticity can       
be imaged, therefore, by measuring motion with an ultrasound speckle            
tracking algorithm, followed by reconstruction of the elasticity                
distribution.  Although some other imaging systems, particularly real-          
time ultrasound, must be used to monitor tissue motion, elasticity              
imaging represents a fundamentally new diagnostic modality.  To                 
investigate quantitative elasticity imaging for medical diagnosis, a            
research plan addressing the important clinical problem of renal                
inflammation and scarring has been formulated.  Preliminary data support        
the hypothesis that kidney elasticity changes with renal damage and             
concomitant scarring before renal problems are detectable by traditional        
diagnostic techniques such as laboratory measurements of renal function.        
Therefore, quantitative elasticity imaging may be valuable in detecting         
and quantifying scar for conditions such as kidney transplant rejection         
where rejection is difficult to quantify from functional measurements           
alone.  Based on the results of these studies, it is the long range goal        
of this research program to develop a sensitive diagnostic technique

Substance abuse is the major health problem in the United States.  The cost     
to society in terms of death, disease, injury and emotional distress            
attributable to alcohol, nicotine, and other drugs is immeasurable.  The        
goal of researchers interested in the neurobiological substrates of drug        
abuse is to understand the powerful motivating and addictive properties of      
drugs, and to develop better treatments for intoxication, craving, and          
relapse.  In recent years, much progress has been made toward the first part    
of this goal.  The neural pathways governing the reinforcing effects of         
drugs are well known, and very recently remarkable advances have been           
achieved in learning about effects of drugs on molecular mechanisms and gene    
expression.  The objective of this proposal is to study in detail the basic     
behavioral functions of the nucleus accumbens, integrating behavioral,          
pharmacological and molecular approaches.  The nucleus accumbens, located       
within the ventromedial striatum, is an important neural substrate for drug     
reinforcement.  It is assumed, therefore, that since drugs appear to exert      
their rewarding properties in this region and its associated circuits, the      
accumbens may play a fundamental role in biological reinforcement and           
regulation of appetitive behaviors.  Relatively little is known, however,       
about the specific neuromolecular mechanisms that underlie the functions of     
the accumbens.  The aims of this project are to investigate the behavioral      
functions of the recently designated ""core"" and ""shell"" subregions of the       
nucleus accumbens.  Specifically, we will 1) investigate the role of            
dopaminergic and glutamatergic receptor mechanisms and their associated         
intracellular mechanisms within the accumbens core in response-reinforcement    
learning, and 2) we will study transmitter mechanisms and circuitry involved    
in controlling feeding behavior located within the accumbens shell.

commensurate.  This will lead to a refined framework that could include         
possibly incommensurate cortical scales and interactions among cortical         
elements.  2) We shall investigate how the Principal Components

of the visual stimulus, to determine how the dynamical dimension of the         
primary visual cortex (viewed as a dynamical system) scales with size.          
3) We shall study the concerted electrical responses of neuronal

(orientation, size, color and so on) are analyzed in the primary visual         
cortex.  Such knowledge is crucial for the construction of cortical             
models, which are essential for any quantitative understanding of               
critical function and dysfunction.

"The long-term objectives of the proposed research are to elucidate the          
stages of speaking skill development in infants and the motor control           
mechanisms for speech production in adults.  These research areas are           
important for early diagnosis and proper treatment of speech disorders.         
The proposed research consists primarily of the development, refinement,        
and experimental testing of a comprehensive neural network modeling             
framework for speech production based on preliminary work described in          
Guenther (Appendices A).  Model additions will include an articulatory          
mechanism that allows synthesis of speech wave-forms and an acoustic-like       
coordinate frame for speech movement planning.  Proposed research also          
includes the development of software for producing speaker-specific vocal       
tract models based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans.  These models     
will allow synthesis of speech signals that account for the differences in      
vocal tract sizes and shapes of different individuals, thus providing a         
more accurate means for investigating the acoustic/articulatory                 
relationships of individuals acting as subjects in speech production            
experiments.  An experimental investigation utilizing these speaker-            
specific vocal tract models is also proposed to test an hypothesis              
generated by the modeling framework.  Some speakers use two entirely            
different articulator configurations, called ""bunched"" and retroflex"", to       
produce /r/ in different contexts.  The proposed model predicts that the        
same target is specified tot he production mechanism in the two cases, but      
that different articulator configurations arise in different contexts due       
to two properties of the speech production mechanism: (1) movement planning     
in an acoustic-like coordinate frame, and (2) transformation of the planned     
acoustic trajectories into articulator movements via a direction-to-            
direction mapping.  Speaker-specific vocal tract models corresponding to        
two subjects will be incorporated into the proposed modeling framework,         
which will then be used to predict which configuration each subject will        
use to produce /r/ in each of four contexts.  The hypothesis will be tested     
by comparing model performance with the performance of the subjects while       
producing /r/ in the same four contests, as measured in an Electro-Magnetic     
Midsagittal Articulometer (EMMA) study.  Finally, the proposed modeling         
framework will be used to investigate several other issues in speech            
production, including two modeling studies of speech motor development in       
infants (made possible by the self-organizing nature of the proposed            
model), and an investigation of intrinsic timing issues.

The ability to utilize hemin and hemin containing compounds as an iron          
source has been documented for several pathogenic bacteria, including the       
periodontopathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis.  We have previously               
determined that P. gingivalis transports the entire hemin moiety into the       
cell by an energy-dependent mechanism and that the binding and accumulation     
of hemin are induced by growth of cultures in the presence of hemin.            
However, the specific P. gingivalis components involved in hemin binding        
and transport have not been identified.  Growth of P. gingivalis under          
hemin-replete conditions has also been shown to influence the expression of     
several virulence factors; however, the role of hemin in the regulation of      
specific virulence genes has not been precisely defined.                        
                                                                                
The primary objectives of the present application are to define the             
molecular mechanisms involved in hemin binding and transport in P.              
gingivalis and to examine the regulation of hemin responsive genes.  Four       
specific aims are proposed:                                                     
                                                                                
1.  To identify and characterize athe P. gingivalis hemin receptor(s).  P.      
gingivalis outer membrane proteins involved in hemin binding will be            
identified by hemin affinity chromatography.  The specificity of the            
putative receptor(s) will be defined by examining the binding of 14[C]hemin     
to P. gingivalis in the presence of hemin and nonahemin iron sources.           
                                                                                
2.  To clone P. gingivalis genes encoding proteins involved in hemin            
binding and transport.  P. gingivalis genes encoding hemin binding proteins     
will be cloned by screening E. coli recombinants for the ability to bind        
hemin.  P. gingivalis genes encoding proteins involved in hemin transport       
will be cloned by screening E. coli hemA mutants for the ability to grow        
with hemin.  Corresponding P. gingivalis mutants will be obtained by            
insertional inactivation of the cloned genes and characterized both in          
vitro and in vivo.                                                              
                                                                                
3.  To elucidate the regulation of hemin binding and transport genes.  The      
regulation of cloned P. gingivalis genes involved in hemin binding and          
transport will be examined by analysis of mRNA and transcriptional fusions      
under hemin-deplete and -replete conditions.                                    
                                                                                
4.  To identify P. gingivalis genes that are regulated by the ferric uptake     
regulator (Fur).  Our preliminary results indicate that the expression of       
hemin/iron-responsive genes in P. gingivalis may be controlled by the           
negative ferric uptake regulator protein, Fur.  We will begin to identify       
P. gingivalis genes that are regulated by Fur by screening a P. gingivalis      
genomic library using the Fur titration asssay.                                 
                                                                                
The results obtained in these studies will allow us to identify specific        
components of the hemin transport system in P. gingivalis and will provide      
important information on the regulation of hemin responsive genes.
