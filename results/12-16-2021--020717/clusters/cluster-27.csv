"     The amino acid sequence of a protein uniquely determines its tertiary
 structure.  Deciphering this relationship, the protein folding problem, has
 become increasingly important to molecular biologists.  DNA sequencing has
 become routine, but structural experiments remain very difficult.
 Computational strategies are needed to help address this problem.
 
      This proposal describes a strategy to identify the location of
 alpha-helices and beta-strands throughout the sequence.  A rationale is
 offered for employing neural networks and pattern based algorithms to
 address the secondary structure prediction problem.  Once secondary
 structure is located, computational methods exist for generating plausible
 tertiary structures.  However, these combinatorial strategies give rise to
 a large number of alternative structures which are difficult to distinguish
 from the correct fold.  Simplified potential functions are proposed as a
 method for overcoming this structure evaluation problem.  The properties of
 a non-lattice based simplified representation of a polypeptide chain will
 be explored to aid in the construction of an appropriate simplified
 potential function. Collaborative ventures are planned to experimentally
 test the merits of existing algorithms for predicting protein structure.
 
      In collaboration with Dr. Bunn at Harvard, the relationship of the
 erythropoietin sequence to its structure and function will be explored.  In
 collaboration with Dr.  Wang at UCSF, the merits of a proposed structure of
 hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase will be studied using site
 directed mutagenesis.  An exploration of the possibility of grafting the
 active site of one enzyme onto the structural scaffold provided by another
 protein will be studied in collaboration with Dr. Craik at UCSF and Dr.
 Wells at Genentech.

"The goal of this project is to refine and evaluate techniques that              
automatically construct, from clinical databases, Bayesian belief networks      
that can be used as diagnostic and prognostic aids.  The amount of              
clinical information stored in databases has increased markedly in the          
last two decades, and it seems likely that this trend will continue.            
Belief networks are able to represent the probabilistic dependencies among      
clinical variables in a relatively general manner.  Researchers have            
developed algorithms for performing probabilistic inference using belief        
networks, and they have applied these algorithms to perform medical             
diagnosis and prognosis.  Although advances have been made in developing        
the theory and application of belief networks, the manual construction of       
these networks often remains a difficult, time-consuming task.  The             
automated generation of belief networks from high-quality databases may         
facilitate significantly the construction of diagnostic and prognostic          
systems, which can serve as clinical decision aids, after their accuracy
