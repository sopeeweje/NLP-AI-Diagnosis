"This grant proposal is focused on developing new mathematical and
 statistical models to describe biological systems. Models to represent,
 help to understand, predict future behavior, and control biological
 systems are becoming more and more important and of widespread use in
 different fields related to biology and health care. Complex mathematical
 models are needed to model the complicated interactions between the
 physiological functions of biological systems, and to model the effect of
 interventions (e.g. therapy) on these functions. The specific aims of this
 grant focus on three areas of research. 1. Develop and investigate
 statistical models for biological population data. Biological data are
 always collected from some population of different individuals, and are
 often highly variable. This is mostly due to variability of physiological
 functions between individuals, and to measurement error. Statistical
 models are needed to deal with the complex structure of population data. I
 will (I) introduce a general methodology based on the use of sophisticated
 heteroscedastic statistical models, which does not explicitly formulate a
 model for interindividual variability but promises to be fast, efficient
 and unbiased; and (ii) investigate the performance of existing population
 models using realistic simulations including model misspecification. 2.
 Develop semi-mechanistic compartmental models. I focus on three main
 problems: (i) the development and investigation a new general class of
 compartmental pharmacokinetics""'pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models, (ii) the
 development of semi-mechanistic black-box compartmental models to deal
 with non-linear PK systems, (iii) the development of the technology to
 apply well established semi-mechanistic linear black-box models to the
 purpose of PK control. 3. Develop new multivariate dynamic models. The
 main problem addressed is how to represent a system where multiple inputs
 (drugs) and multiple interrelated responses are measured. I propose
 different classes of models to do so based on spline networks and
 eventually neural networks. The proposed models can incorporate a
 compartmental sub-structure to easily deal with kinetics. Continuous and
 discrete time versions of the models are considered. The statistical and
 mathematical models introduced in the grant have widespread application to
 a variety of biological fields. However specific areas, directly linked to
 health care issues, are selected for active research and application of
 the proposed models. These areas correspond to experimental situations
 where the models proposed in the grant are particularly needed (nonlinear
 and multivariate dynamic), and represent continuations of already
 established collaborations with leading scientists. They include: computer
 control of ultra-short acting anaesthetic drugs administration,
 pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic of short-acting anesthetics,
 pharmacodynamic of nicotine and nicotine tolerance development, adenosine
 kinetics and metabolism and their relationship to adenosine
 pharmacodynamic effects, modeling of cardiovascular drugs effects on
 pharmacy dynamic responses (heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing
 variability) sampled at high rates.

"We will continue our development of methods for recognizing and

"Stuttering is a disorder of speech with a prevalence estimated to be 1 %        
of the world's population of school-age children. It is often a                 
significant communicative problem for the individual, limiting educational      
and employment opportunities and social and psychological adjustment. The       
etiology of stuttering is unknown, and standardized, successful treatments      
for stuttering have not been developed. A major impediment to                   
understanding the etiology of stuttering and to the development of              
successful therapeutic techniques is the lack of understanding of the           
physiological bases of the disorder. Stuttering manifests itself as a           
breakdown in speech motor processes. The complex variables known to affect      
the occurrence of stuttering, such as emotional state or linguistic             
complexity, must ultimately have an effect on the physiological events          
necessary for the production of speech. Therefore, to understand                
stuttering it is essential to understand the physiological mechanisms           
underlying disruptions of speech motor processes in stuttering.                 
                                                                                
The research proposed in the present application addresses this general         
question: What is the nature of the movement disorder associated with           
stuttering? The specific aims are (1) to determine whether motor processes      
show evidence of continuous, underlying disturbances in stutterers'             
speech, (2) to assess whether failures in speech movement control in            
stuttering are related to autonomic nervous system activity and/or to           
metabolic respiratory control, (3) to develop new metrics for the analysis      
of physiological signals related to speech and to apply these new metrics       
to the assessment of stuttering, and (4) to develop pattern recognition         
algorithms to determine if there is a consistent set of physiological           
events associated with stuttering. The results of the proposed studies and      
those completed in the past years of this project should help us to             
understand the complex human behavior that is stuttering. In addition,          
work on this project has significant implications for the study of normal       
speech production and a variety of motor speech disorders that occur in

"DESCRIPTION (Adapted from applicant's abstract):  Visuomotor integration        
depends on a remarkable coherence among a number of interrelated                
subprocesses such as pattern recognition, pattern discrimination, decision      
to move, and guidance of movement.  The brain is able to integrate these        
elementary cognitive processes by coordinating the activities of diverse        
neural structures in the face of continuously varying processing demands.       
The question of how this coordination operates is central to understanding      
the neural basis of visuomotor function.  This proposal aims to develop new     
analytical tools to investigate the coordinated activity of distributed         
neuronal ensembles in the cerebral cortex of humans and non-human primates      
performing simple visuomotor tasks.  It is motivated by recent theoretical      
developments (Bressler 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997) predicting a general         
cortical mechanism allowing the flexible large-scale functional coordination    
of interacting neuronal ensembles.  Hypotheses concerning this mechanism        
will be tested by analysis of field potential data recorded at NIMH from        
macaque monkeys performing a visuomotor pattern recognition task.  The          
challenge is to develop and test new analytic approaches that characterize      
the multiple, complex interactions of large-scale distributed cortical          
networks.  Earlier analysis of a small portion of this NIMH data set,           
reported in Nature in 1993, revealed shifting patterns of multi-site            
cortical synchronization during visuomotor processing, and implicated           
synchronization in the formation of functional relations within and between     
cortical areas.  Standard pairwise techniques were employed to measure          
synchronization between field potential signals.  Here, novel methods of        
time-series analysis are proposed that go beyond the simple detection of        
network interactions.  Advances in signal processing technology will be         
utilized to also derive multi-site interaction patterns, to analyze the         
dependencies of functional relations on particular groups of neurons, and to    
measure the flow of information between cortical regions.  This                 
collaborative project will draw on the complementary strengths of Drs.          
Bressler and Ding.  Dr. Bressler brings to the project over 15 years of         
experience in cognitive neuroscience, with expertise in the recording and       
analysis of neuroelectric data from humans to animals.  He will provide         
theoretical oversight and the application of analytic tools to the field        
potential data set.  Dr. Ding, although relatively new to cognitive             
neuroscience, has over 10 years of experience in linear and nonlinear           
dynamical systems analysis.  He will provide the development of new             
analytical methods from a comprehensive dynamical systems perspective.  This    
work is expected to (1) produce new insights into the dynamics of cortical      
information flow in visual perception and motor performance, (2) make           
available new digital signal processing tools for the investigation of large    
scale neural systems underlying other cognitive functions and, (3) provide a    
fresh perspective on the design of complex architectures for the execution      
of cognitive tasks by artificial neural network systems.

"DESCRIPTION:  Stage matched interventions for stress management that are interactive and individualized, and are delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts.  Computer based expert systems linked to self-help manuals can be as effective as counselors but at much lower cost and greater accessibility.  Stress is an important cause of cancer and other chronic and acute diseases and is one of the most costly behaviors in terms of health care, job performance and disability.  Fifty million Americans do not practice effective stress management.  Existing programs are action-oriented and are designed for the 30% of populations who are prepared to take action.  Stage matched programs can meet the needs of all; the 45% in the Pre-contemplation stage and the 25% in the Contemplation stage.  Phase I of this Fast-Track research will demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting 70% of at-risk populations and the acceptability of the expert system interventions.  Phase II will complete recruitment of 1200 participants randomly assigned to treatment or control and can demonstrate efficacy of these interventions over six months.  Follow-up over 18 months can show increasing impact long after the intervention.
