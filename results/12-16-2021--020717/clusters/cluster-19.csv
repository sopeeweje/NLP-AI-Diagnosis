"Our goal in this continuing Program Project is still to facilitate the
 transfer of basic science information from the laboratory to help deal with
 clinical problems in breast cancer, but our focus broadens from primarily
 prognostic and mechanistic considerations in two directions.  First, we
 will study the molecular correlates of the developmental stages in early
 breast cancer, to provide not only greater understanding of how the full
 malignant phenotype is acquired, but also greater clinical ability to
 distinguish and thus to treat those benign or early malignant lesions
 destined to cause serious trouble.  Second, at the other end of the
 clinical course, we will be dissecting the components of growth factor
 pathways as potential targets of new treatment strategies and testing such
 strategies directly in preclinical model systems.
 
 The projects will study:  1) the problem of how best to integrate both new
 and existing prognostic factors into a coherent assessment of risk for
 individual patients, comparing expanded forms of the traditional Cox
 multivariate analysis with newer recursive partitioning and artificial
 intelligence (neural network) approaches; 2) the occurrence of mutations
 and variants in the functional domains of the steroid receptor genes, which
 could result in failures to respond to hormone manipulation even though
 receptor is present, or in failure to detect receptor, or even in an
 oncogene-like receptor variant which would stimulate the tumor cell even in
 the absence of hormone; 3) potential molecular markers -- activated
 oncogenes, proliferation markers, antigens associated with metastatic
 behavior, etc.--in well defined early and later lesions at several stages,
 in order to see which markers might identify high risk lesions and to learn
 more about the evolutionary pathway (or pathways) by which breast cancer
 progresses; 4) antigens associated with proliferation as new prognostic
  as new prognostic
 markers; 5) TGFalpha as an autocrine mediator of estrogen action, as a
 factor in the development of hyperplastic lesions in transgenic mice
 expressing a TGFalpha gene (and/or an EGF-R gene) in the mammary glands,
 and as a target for inhibiting malignant progression; 6) the insulin-like
 growth factor (IGF) system, especially the receptors, IGFRI and IGFRII and
 the IGF binding proteins, as targets for blocking breast cancer growth and
 tumorigenesis.  These projects will all be supported by a tumor/data
 network core function, flow cytometry, factor assay, and tissue culture
 core laboratories, and an administrative core.
 
 Many of the factors and markers studied in these interactive projects will
 have important clinical significance.  Indeed, our major effort will be to
 help oncologists integrate and appropriately utilize basic science
 information in the 1990's in diagnostic and treatment strategies for the
 breast cancer patient.

"A significant fraction of all courses of external-beam radiotherapy have
 unplanned interruptions, i.e. scheduled treatments are missed. Because of
 the kinetics of cellular damage repair and tumor repopulation, designing
 extra or augmented treatments to compensate for the missed fractions is
 non-trivial. Since some individualized compensation regimen must be
 chosen, it should be rationalized using state-of-the-art radiobiology.  In
 Phase I we wrote prototype software (RIC, the Radiotherapy Interruption
 Compensator) which produces a range of practical options for the
 radiotherapist to compensate for unplanned interruptions during an
 extended radiotherapy regimen. It calculates what doses are needed to
 produce equal tumor control (or, alternately, equal late normal-tissue
 complications) when a proposed interruption-compensated regimen is
 substituted for the originally planned protocol. The program is designed
 as an ""expert system"", making available to any practicing radiotherapist
 the expertise of leading practitioners, in a personal-computer based,
 user-friendly package.
 
 Having demonstrated feasibility, we propose, in this Phase II application,
 to continue the research effort initiated in Phase I. The goal is to
 produce, at the end of the Phase II period, a marketable product which is
 a) scientifically state-of-the-art, b) designed and written with
 appropriate quality control, c) robust to use, d) credible to practicing
 clinicians.

"Our overall objective is to solve the problem of how proteins fold into
 their native conformations.  For this purpose, we are using the
 methodology of protein chemistry and developing and applying experimental
 and theoretical techniques to provide an understanding of the internal
 interactions that stabilize native proteins in aqueous solution.  This
 project is concerned with the theoretical work which involves the use of
 empirical potentials (including the effects of hydration and entropy) in
 various computational approaches to study the interactions in protein
 folding.  Emphasis is currently being placed on solving the multiple-
 minima problem arising from the existence of numerous local minima in the
 potential energy surface of the protein, the objective being to locate the
 global minimum on this surface.  An understanding of the interactions in
 proteins is of potential applicability to the elucidation of the role of
 conformation in biological processes, e.g. the undesirable association of
 sickle-cell hemoglobin, or the induction of an oncogene product whose
 properties involve a conformational change when only one amino acid
 residue in the sequence is changed.

"The goal of this project is to develop rehabilitation guidelines for            
restoration of ambulation in patients following a stroke. Specifically          
the aims are to identify patterns of gait deviations in both the sound

of motor control strategies used during walking and relate these findings       
to the patient's potential for recovery of ambulation and response to           
intensive rehabilitation. Three gait training strategies will be                
compared: i) supported treadmill gait training, 2) intensified-use of the       
paretic leg and 3) functional independence and endurance training using         
motor learning principles. Variables that predict improvement in walking        
ability after rehabilitation will be identified. Three clinical tests           
(Functional Independence Measure, Fugl-meyer and Upright Motor Control)         
will be used to identify predictor-criteria. Testing will be done within        
one week of admission to rehabilitation and at the 6 month-post-stroke          
anniversary. Gait analysis will be performed to define outcome measures         
(level and community velocities) and associated gait impairment variables       
(muscle and motion patterns). The comprehensive baseline gait evaluation        
will be conducted within the first week the patient is able to walk six         
meters with assistance. Follow-up testing will be conducted at discharge        
from inpatient rehabilitation and at 6 months and i year post-stroke.

"This grant proposal is focused on developing new mathematical and               
statistical models to describe biological systems. Models to represent,         
help to understand, predict future behavior, and control biological             
systems are becoming more and more important and of widespread use in           
different fields related to biology and health care. Complex mathematical       
models are needed to model the complicated interactions between the             
physiological functions of biological systems, and to model the effect of       
interventions (e.g. therapy) on these functions. The specific aims of this      
grant focus on three areas of research. 1. Develop and investigate              
statistical models for biological population data. Biological data are          
always collected from some population of different individuals, and are         
often highly variable. This is mostly due to variability of physiological       
functions between individuals, and to measurement error. Statistical            
models are needed to deal with the complex structure of population data. I      
will (I) introduce a general methodology based on the use of sophisticated      
heteroscedastic statistical models, which does not explicitly formulate a       
model for interindividual variability but promises to be fast, efficient        
and unbiased; and (ii) investigate the performance of existing population       
models using realistic simulations including model misspecification. 2.         
Develop semi-mechanistic compartmental models. I focus on three main            
problems: (i) the development and investigation a new general class of          
compartmental pharmacokinetics""'pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models, (ii) the        
development of semi-mechanistic black-box compartmental models to deal          
with non-linear PK systems, (iii) the development of the technology to          
apply well established semi-mechanistic linear black-box models to the          
purpose of PK control. 3. Develop new multivariate dynamic models. The          
main problem addressed is how to represent a system where multiple inputs       
(drugs) and multiple interrelated responses are measured. I propose             
different classes of models to do so based on spline networks and               
eventually neural networks. The proposed models can incorporate a               
compartmental sub-structure to easily deal with kinetics. Continuous and        
discrete time versions of the models are considered. The statistical and        
mathematical models introduced in the grant have widespread application to      
a variety of biological fields. However specific areas, directly linked to      
health care issues, are selected for active research and application of         
the proposed models. These areas correspond to experimental situations          
where the models proposed in the grant are particularly needed (nonlinear       
and multivariate dynamic), and represent continuations of already               
established collaborations with leading scientists. They include: computer      
control of ultra-short acting anaesthetic drugs administration,                 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic of short-acting anesthetics,                   
pharmacodynamic of nicotine and nicotine tolerance development, adenosine       
kinetics and metabolism and their relationship to adenosine                     
pharmacodynamic effects, modeling of cardiovascular drugs effects on            
pharmacy dynamic responses (heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing           
variability) sampled at high rates.

will (I) introduce a general methodology based on the use of sophisticated      
heteroscedastic statistical models, which does not explicitly formulate a       
model for interindividual variability but promises to be fast, efficient        
and unbiased; and (ii) investigate the performance of existing population       
models using realistic simulations including model misspecification. 2.         
Develop semi-mechanistic compartmental models. I focus on three main            
problems: (i) the development and investigation a new general class of          
compartmental pharmacokinetics""'pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models, (ii) the        
development of semi-mechanistic black-box compartmental models to deal          
with non-linear PK systems, (iii) the development of the technology to          
apply well established semi-mechanistic linear black-box models to the          
purpose of PK control. 3. Develop new multivariate dynamic models. The          
main problem addressed is how to represent a system where multiple inputs       
(drugs) and multiple interrelated responses are measured. I propose             
different classes of models to do so based on spline networks and               
eventually neural networks. The proposed models can incorporate a               
compartmental sub-structure to easily deal with kinetics. Continuous and        
discrete time versions of the models are considered. The statistical and        
mathematical models introduced in the grant have widespread application to      
a variety of biological fields. However specific areas, directly linked to      
health care issues, are selected for active research and application of         
the proposed models. These areas correspond to experimental situations          
where the models proposed in the grant are particularly needed (nonlinear       
and multivariate dynamic), and represent continuations of already               
established collaborations with leading scientists. They include: computer      
control of ultra-short acting anaesthetic drugs administration,                 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic of short-acting anesthetics,                   
pharmacodynamic of nicotine and nicotine tolerance development, adenosine       
kinetics and metabolism and their relationship to adenosine                     
pharmacodynamic effects, modeling of cardiovascular drugs effects on            
pharmacy dynamic responses (heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing           
variability) sampled at high rates.

"In the STARE (STructured Analysis of the REtina) project, we are                
developing a computerized image-interpreting system with hierarchical

The STARE system is designed to find objects of interest (normal                
anatomical structures and lesions) in digitized ocular fundus images and        
to use these objects to diagnose an image, to detect changes in                 
sequential images, and to make clinically useful measurements that are          
currently tedious or costly. To accomplish these difficult goals, we            
must segment and identify the objects of interest. Identified objects           
can be used to compare images, and the objects can be assembled to              
describe the image. Image interpretation incorporating expert systems

There was no established paradigm to follow to construct a system for           
image interpretation. We designed the overall structure of the process          
and determined how each task was to be accomplished. We have broken the         
project into steps, each of which has been accomplished. We are able to         
find objects of importance and correctly identify and localize them on          
a fundus coordinate system that we designed. We have created and tested         
a neural network and an expert system (INTELLEYE) to handle the

We will now improve the accuracy of each step, increase the number of           
lesions we can identify, and integrate the image analysis steps with the        
expert system to allow smooth progression from image to diagnosis and           
change detection. We will validate the usefulness and accuracy of the           
system by comparing its diagnosis and image comparison to trained
