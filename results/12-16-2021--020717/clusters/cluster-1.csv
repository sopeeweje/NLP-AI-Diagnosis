"Neural network optimization algorithms greatly enhance our ability to
 construct large-scale, dynamical models of highly interconnected networks.
 Until now, optimization has only been applied to networks of simplistic
 processing units, ignoring the integrative and temporal response
 properties of single neurons, thus limiting the predictive power of the
 models.  The long-term goal of this project is to develop a hybrid
 modeling strategy in which optimization methods are applied to networks of
 realistic,multicompartmental model neurons. To accomplish this goal, we
 will construct a hybrid model of an actual distributed processing network
 composed of repeatably identifiable sensory, motor, and interneurons that
 computes a well-defined behavioral input-output function. Optimization
 will be used to predict the connectivity of as-yet-unidentified
 interneurons in the actual network and the predictions will be tested by
 identifying the interneurons by physiological and morphological means.
 Performance of the hybrid model will be assessed by comparing it to the
 performance of an a priori model in which all connection strengths are
 determined physiologically. The final model will be used to predict the
 loci of synaptic plasticity underlying nonassociative conditioning of the
 reflex by incorporating local learning rules and by optimization methods.
 The predictions will be tested by determining the actual plastic sites
 physiologically.  This project will have the combined effect of enhancing
 the predictive power of optimized network models and illuminating the
 relation between computations at the single-neuron and network levels.

"DESCRIPTION (Adapted from applicant's abstract): The ""closed-loop               
artificial pancreas,"" a device that would measure glucose level and             
deliver insulin automatically as needed, has been an elusive goal in the        
treatment of diabetes. There are three essential components: the blood          
glucose sensor, linking algorithms and the delivery system. For the first       
time, a viable sensor and a proven delivery system are now available for        
research. The broad goal of this clinical research proposal is to complete      
the studies needed to link the sensor to the delivery system, paving the        
way for a functional closed-loop artificial pancreas. First, we will make       
a detailed analysis of sensor signal as it reflects glucose level in            
normal and diabetic humans. Second, we will study the precise                   
pharmacokinetics of insulin delivery by external and implantable insulin        
pumps. Third, analysis of these two data sets will provide the basis for        
algorithms that link the sensor signal to insulin delivery. A formal            
safety analysis will evaluate the safety features needed in a closed loop       
device. In the last year of the project, the entire system will be tested       
and fine-tuned. This project takes advantage of our relatively extensive        
investigational experience with mechanical insulin delivery pumps in            
people with diabetes, and the recent availability, for research, of a           
subcutaneously placed, glucose oxidase-based continuous glucose sensor.         
The investigators have established experienced with clinical research in        
diabetes, and the resources of an excellent General Clinical Research           
Center. The co-investigators have extensive experience with mathematical        
modeling of biologic systems. There is a close working relationship             
between the research team and the manufacturer of the sensor and pumps, as      
reflected by the Interactive Research Project Grant collaboration, and by       
a long-standing history of collaboration. It is essential to emphasize          
that we do not anticipate completion of a manufacturable, clinically            
usable, commercially viable artificial pancreas within the time-frame of        
this work. Rather, we aim to complete the basic studies and modeling

These investigators have developed an innovative technique for this application, based upon wavelet transforms and multiresolution image analysis. Used with modern computerized chromosome analysis the proposed technique promises significantly improved enhancement of chromosome banding patterns and more effective visual detection of subtle rearrangements. This will help clinicians and researchers detect previously invisible or sub-visible band pattern alterations in conventional and high resolution banding. It will significantly increase the ability of automated instruments to assist the evaluation of chromosome alterations in clinical samples and in normal and neoplastic mammalian cells. During Phase I we implemented and tested three wavelet transforms with desirable mathematical properties. We developed a prototype multiresolution image processing system for chromosome enhancement. We obtained extremely encouraging results, strongly suggesting that these techniques offer considerably improved enhancement capability over conventional methods. and clearly demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. In Phase II we will complete the implementation and refinement of the software.
