"The research plan outlined in this proposal is part of a long-range study
 to understand the role of the cerebellum in the control and regulation of
 posture and movement. The specific aims of this proposal focus on the
 organization and representation of sensory information in spinal
 projection pathways and in the cerebellum.
 
 The dorsal spinocerebellar tract (DSCT) transmits to the cerebellum
 information derived from sensory receptors in muscle, joints and skin of
 the hind limbs. The content of the signals transmitted and their
 utilization by the cerebellum are not known, yet these are central to an
 understanding of cerebellar function as it relates to spinal motor
 functions.
 
 The proposed research will investigate neuronal population behavior in the
 DSCT and cerebellum by recording from large numbers of randomly sampled
 neurons, and by using statistical methods based on principal component
 analysis and correlation analysis. The main issues to be addressed are the
 nature of the information encoded and the way in which it is encoded.
 These issues will be examined in the context of a new working hypothesis
 about the functional role of the spinocerebellar system: It is proposed
 that the information transmitted by spinocerebellar pathways provides a
 sensory representation of limb stiffness which may be used to regulate
 stiffness as a background for posture and movement. Experiments will test
 specific issues related to this hypothesis. The research is expected to
 provide new evidence about the role of the nervous system in motor
 control.
 
 Motor control disorders constitute a major health problem with
 considerable economic consequences. Basic research, such as that proposed
 here, is needed to understand better the role played by neuronal
 structures like the spinal cord and the cerebellum in the normal control
 of posture and movement.

"DESCRIPTION (Applicant's Abstract):  Facial expression communicates             
information about emotional response and plays a critical role in the           
regulation of interpersonal behavior.  Current human-observer based methods     
for measuring facial expression are labor intensive, qualitative, and           
difficult to standardize across laboratories and over time.  To make            
feasible more rigorous, quantitative measurement of facial expression in        
diverse applications, we formed an interdisciplinary research group which       
covers expertise in facial expression analysis and image processing.  In the    
funding period, we developed and demonstrated the first version of an           
automated system for measuring facial expression in digitized images.  The      
system can discriminate nine combinations of FACS action units in the upper     
and lower face, quantity the timing and topography of action unit intensity     
in the brow region; and geometrically normalize image sequences within a        
range of plus or minus 20 degrees of out of-plane.                              
                                                                                
In the competing renewal, we will increase the number of action unit            
combinations that are recognized, implement convergent methods of               
quantifying action unit intensity, increase the generalizability of action      
unit estimation to a wider range of image orientations, test facial image       
processing (FIP) in image sequences from directed facial action tasks and       
laboratory studies of emotion regulation, and facilitate the integration of     
FIP into existing data management and statistical analysis software for use     
by behavioral science researchers and clinicians.  With these goals             
completed, FIP will eliminate the need for human observers in coding facial     
expression, promote standardize measurement, make possible the collection       
and processing of larger, more representative data sets, and open new areas     
of investigation and clinical application.

"The goal of this project is to develop an Early Vocalization Analyzer           
(EVA), a computer program to automatically analyze recorded samples of          
infant vocalizations. This program will be the basis of a screening test,       
for use in hospitals and clinics, to evaluate which infants are at-risk         
for later communication or other developmental problems. The major purpose      
of this Phase-I project is to determine whether the landmark detection          
theory of Stevens, as implemented for the recognition of adult speech, can      
be adapted to the analysis of syllabic pre-speech vocalizations produced        
by typically developing infants. We will also merge this landmark-              
detection algorithm with a kernel version of EVA, developed by a team at        
Northeastern University, to produce a proof-of-concept prototype that will      
count the number of utterances, detect and count syllable-like                  
vocalizations, and classify them according to fundamental frequency and         
duration. The goal of Phase II is to develop a commercial software program

"We propose developing statistical fractal features which quantify lesion        
border roughness on mammograms and using these features to distinguish          
malignant and benign breast lesions.  Objective measures of lesion              
roughness are important in the diagnosis and staging of breast cancer.          
In this novel approach, we generate a space of fractal models, and              
evaluate the fractal dimension (fd) of the lesion from the statistics           
of the model space.                                                             
                                                                                
Using intensity as the third dimension, we generate a 3-dimensional             
image of the mammogram and select a set of intensity levels found in the

thresholded image and trace the lesion border.  Analysis is restricted
