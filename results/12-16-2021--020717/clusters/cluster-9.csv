"We propose to design efficient computer algorithms providing novel and/or
 improved methods and software for a number of computational problems in
 molecular biology.  the emphasis will b eon blending theoretical results
 with practical concerns.  All software emerging from the project will be
 made available free of charge.  The proposal and the principal
 investigator's current research efforts are divided into three projects.
 
 The first project centers on computational problems in the physical mapping
 and sequencing of DNA.  We propose to continue refining a software system
 for the fragment assembly problem, i.e., determine the most likely complete
 DNA sequence consistent with electrophoresis data gathered from cloned
 fragments.  The refinements consist of improved algorithms for a number of
 the phases of the computation, expanding the functionality to support user-
 interaction, and developing a complete environment to support megabase
 sequencing projects.  The methods we developed for fragment assembly also
 apply in large part to the problem of determining physical maps via various
 fingerprinting techniques.  We have formulated a generalized assembly
 problem and plan to build a system that is capable of solving such problems
 for any combination of restriction map, digest, and hybridization
 information about the clones.
 
 The second project is to design algorithms for a number of computational
 problems arising in molecular biology.  Progress in this arena tends to be
 inspired rather than calculated.  We demonstrate our track record of
 producing interesting results and then describe the following problems for
 which we have a number of ideas and preliminary results:  sublinear
 similarity searches, restriction map comparison, super pattern matching
 (gene recognition), determining restriction maps from digest data,
 designing oligonucleotide probes, and RNA secondary structure prediction.
 
 The objective of the last project is to develop a pattern matching system
 permitting the expression of complex patterns and their reduction to
 efficient search strategies.  The pattern specification language is simple
 yet powerful enough to succinctly express the most complex patterns of
 biological interest.  An ""expert system"" compiler for the language will
 examine a pattern and will choose a search strategy or combination of
 strategies from a built-in library of basic search techniques.  The build-
 in library will contain implementations of the best available search
 algorithms for exact and approximate matches to keywords, repeats, and
 regular expressions.  Using a dynamic-programming style calculation the
 expert compiler chooses the optimal backtracking strategy over the basic
 library searches.  We have proven the efficacy of this approach on a small
 prototype for a subset of the language that is useful for specifying
 protein motifs.  We now propose to embark upon the construction of a
 complete system.

analysis, and artificial neural networks, as well as a novel use of

the development of well-documented, user-friendly software and

"DESCRIPTION (adapted from applicant's abstract):  A central issue in            
behavioral neuroscience is how alterations in neural pathways mediate the       
durable behavior changes involved in learning.  Taste aversion conditioning     
is an excellent model for studying the neural changes involved in learning      
because this conditioning can occur in a single trial, despite lengthy          
delays between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli.  The proposed studies     
are based on the identification of a cellular correlate of the behavioral       
expression of a conditioned taste aversion, namely, cells in the nucleus of     
the solitary tract.  C-fos induction occurs in cells in the nucleus of the      
solitary tract in response to a taste made aversive by conditioning, but not    
in response to the same taste prior to conditioning or to a taste (quinine)     
which is innately aversive.  Proposed studies will combine this cellular        
measure with behavioral assessment to further assess the cellular c-fos         
response and its reliability as a marker of learning.  Studies will also        
examine the functional importance of cells in the nucleus of the solitary       
tract which display c-fos induction during expression of this learning,
