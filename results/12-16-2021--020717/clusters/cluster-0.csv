"This application seeks funding for Phase II of a three-phase program of
 research to identify, classify, and test nursing sensitive patient
 outcomes and their indicators for use in standardized language
 development, practice, research, and education.  The purposes of the
 research are to:  1) identify, label, validate, and classify nursing
 sensitive patient outcomes and indicators, 2) evaluate the validity and
 usefulness of the classification in clinical field testing, and 3) define
 and test measurement procedures for the outcomes and indicators.  The
 classification is expected to contain patient outcomes, indicators, and
 measurement activities at three to four levels of abstraction and to
 identify those patient outcomes most influenced by nursing.  The research
 uses both inductive and deductive approaches.  An inductive approach will
 be used to extract outcomes, indicators, and measures from current
 nursing literature and instruments.  A combined inductive and deductive
 approach will be used to label outcomes, specify indicators for the
 outcomes, and group the outcomes in broad categories based on the Medical
 Outcomes framework and categories identified by nurses.  Delphi
 techniques and surveys of random samples of masters prepared nurses will
 be used to validate the outcomes and indicators prior to field testing
 the outcomes and indicators in four sites, a tertiary care hospital, a
 community hospital, a nursing home, and a community agency.  Hierarchical
 clustering techniques and nonmetric scaling analysis will be used to
 develop the classification of nursing sensitive patient outcomes and a
 survey of nurse experts will be used for initial validation of the
 classification.

"The long term goal of our research is to understand the flow of                 
information from the genome to the phenotype of organisms. In this              
proposal, we will attempt to use Bayesian networks and near-optimal             
sequence alignments to represent protein secondary structures and motifs.       
A Bayesian network describes the likelihood of amino acids at each              
position in a motif as well as the dependence of amino acids in one             
position on the amino acids at other position. Hence, Bayesian networks         
can describe both the conservation of amino acids at single positions and       
the conservation of correlations between two positions simultaneously.          
                                                                                
Conserved amino acids result from evolutionary selection for a specific         
amino acid or type of amino acid at one position in a protein structure.        
These positions often have important functional or structural                   
requirements. Correlated changes between amino acids generally result from      
side-chain side-chain interactions between pairs of amino acids in a            
protein's structure. The types of correlations we have represented with         
Bayesian networks include electrostatic charges, hydrophobicity, hydrogen-      
bond donor and acceptor and inversely correlated packing volumes among          
others. These Bayesian networks can be used to 1) discover side-chain           
side--chain interactions within protei motifs and 2) to search sequence         
databases for motifs showing both correlations and conserved amino acids.       
                                                                                
Near-optimal alignments between two sequences can display regions that          
have been more highly conserved or less highly conserved using the              
information contained in only two sequences. The most highly conserved          
region correspond to the most highly structured regions and the most            
highly variable regions correspond to loops and coils and other                 
hypervariable regions. We propose to use near-optimal alignments to             
display conserved secondary structures of proteins and hypervariable            
regions. We will use secondary-structure specific amino acid substitution       
matrices to provide specificity.                                                
                                                                                
The goals of this proposal are to 1) build a database of Bayesian networks      
that represent protein motifs, 2) test these networks for their ability to      
detect motifs using test sets and crossvalidation methods, 3) compare           
these networks with other methods for searching protein databases , 4)          
build an integrated set of Bayesian networks to predict protein secondary       
structure, 5) compare the prediction of protein secondary structure with

"This research addresses one of the remaining challenges in speech science,      
high quality speech simulation.  We define speech simulation as a form of       
speech synthesis in which the movement of air and tissue is under               
experimental control, rather than the resulting acoustic signal.  From the      
early days of speech synthesis nearly a half century ago, the expectation       
has always been that a better representation of the laws of physics of air      
and tissue in motion would produce better synthesis. Although this              
expectation still exists today, the payoff has been slow, primarily             
because there are few data sets from which to build theoretical

colleagues draw upon experience gained with simulation of the phonatory

the voice of a given speaker to be transformed into a different age,

"DESCRIPTION:  The principal investigator notes that the Aldol addition          
reaction is one of the most important carbon-carbon bond forming                
reactions in  synthetic organic chemistry, that it is widely used in the        
synthesis of drugs  and other biologically active molecules and that the        
reaction is now most  often run in non-polar solvents, such as                  
tetrahydrofuran (THF), frequently  with lithium salts of carbonyl               
compounds (lithium enolates).  He reports that  the aggregation of these        
compounds has been characterized by solution properties, NMR and by X-ray       
crystallography and that such aggregates have  been proposed as the             
reactive species in the Aldol-type additions with other  carbonyl               
derivatives but there have been very few studies on the actual role  of         
such aggregates in reactions.  He goes on to note that by a combination         
of  UV-vis spectroscopic and proton transfer equilibrium studies of some        
lithium  enolates, aggregation constants have been obtained even in             
dilute solution and  that spectra as a function of concentration are            
analyzed by ""Singular Value  Decomposition"" to determine the number of          
different species present and to permit deconvolution to give the               
spectrum of each component.  For this purpose  a glovebox-spectrometer          
apparatus has been developed in which the sample  compartment built into        
the glovebox is connected with a spectrometer with  fiber-optic cables.         
It is noted that the apparatus permits spectroscopy of  solutions               
prepared and studied under the inert atmosphere of the glovebox.  The           
results thus far are said to suggest that the monomeric ion pairs might         
play an important kinetic role in reactions.                                    
                                                                                
It is proposed to extend such studies to additional enolates of interest        
and  to measure the reaction kinetics of their Aldol additions to               
aldehydes and  ketones and of Michael addition reactions with unsaturated       
carbonyl compounds.  It is indicated that the kinetic studies will show         
the state of aggregation of  the enolate reactive species and that              
knowledge of the relative roles of ion  pair monomers and aggregates will       
lead to more complete reaction mechanisms  and to the better                    
understanding required for sophisticated synthesis design.  The principal       
investigator notes that in particular, the roles of solvent  addends,           
such as lithium salts, hexamethylphosphoric triamide, and di- and               
triamines will be studied under carefully controlled conditions to              
determine  the role of coordination of lithium in the stereochemistry of

proton transfer equilibria and reaction kinetics of Aldol and Michael

diketones.  It  is noted that these dilithium salts are also being used         
increasingly in  organic synthesis but that the reaction mechanisms are         
virtually unstudied.  It is reported that these salts are also aggregated       
but nothing is known about  the relative reactivities of monomers and           
aggregates.  The proposed studies  are to provide unique information            
about these reactions, which would be  difficult to obtain in any other         
way.  It is suggested that subsequent  extension to other salts of alkali       
and alkaline earth metals, early and late  transition metals and

systems. Image sensors with smarts or computational capability at each          
pixel can be advantageously used in the application to build extremely          
compact and low-cost automated screening systems. Morphological                 
filtering algorithms have been shown to be effective at detecting object        
size and shape, which are distinguishing features in diagnostic                 
microscopy. The goal of this research is to design, simulate and                
fabricate a CMOS chip with morphological filtering circuits at each             
pixel, which will allow detecting suspicious cells in a Pap Smear at            
more than 1000 frames/second. In Phase I, Bosonics will (1) determine           
the desired imager's technical capabilities for a compact microscope            
mountable smart camera (2) design candidate morphological filtering             
architectures and circuits; (3) simulate the morphological algorithms           
with realistic circuits models; and (4) design and fabricate a 5x5              
imager demonstration chip in CMOS.
