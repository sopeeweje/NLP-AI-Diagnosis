"The proposed research has the broad long-term objective of providing useful     
computer-based consultative assistance to clinicians faced with complex         
choices among diagnostic and therapeutic options. This advice will be           
provided by an intelligent decision system, a computer program employing        
artificial intelligence techniques to automate the generation of decision       
models and analysis of those models to produce a recommendation. The            
advantages of incorporating decision analytic principles are explicit           
consideration of uncertainty and patients' preferences, and an axiomatic        
approach which links the decision elements to a recommendation. The system      
will permit users to control the elements of a decision model and will thus     
constitute a decision analysis workbench rather than a traditional expert       
system.                                                                         
                                                                                
The project will focus on the evaluation of pulmonary infiltrates in            
patients with the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or suspected        
AIDS. This is an important and increasingly common problem which involves       
high stakes for individual patients and a bewildering array of diagnostic       
and therapeutic options with complex trade-offs for clinicians. In this         
medical area, knowledge of disease prognoses and efficacy of therapy is         
rapidly accumulating. Thus, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies must          
continuously evolve in response to new data.                                    
                                                                                
The system is to be implemented in the Common LISP programming language on      
an Intel 80386-based microcomputer. The system will employ separate             
knowledge bases for decision analytic knowledge and medical domain              
knowledge. The modularity inherent in this organization will facilitate         
expansion and refinement of the knowledge base in response to new research      
findings and the availability of new techniques. The system will use a          
frame-based representation of diseases, diagnostic tests and treatments.        
These frames and their relations will determine the alternatives and            
outcomes modeled by the system. A network representation of probabilistic       
dependencies will ensure that the consistent updating of probabilities is       
performed in each decision tree context. Generation of a decision model         
will be guided by context-dependent rules which will determine at any given     
point in the tree which events to consider and how deeply to expand the         
decision model. The system will also contain facilities to tailor               
preference functions and probabilities to individual patients. Abstracted       
cases from the medical records of patients seen in our institution who have     
pulmonary infiltrates and AIDS or suspected AIDS will be used for system        
evaluation.

"This grant proposal is focused on developing new mathematical and               
statistical models to describe biological systems. Models to represent,         
help to understand, predict future behavior, and control biological             
systems are becoming more and more important and of widespread use in           
different fields related to biology and health care. Complex mathematical       
models are needed to model the complicated interactions between the             
physiological functions of biological systems, and to model the effect of       
interventions (e.g. therapy) on these functions. The specific aims of this      
grant focus on three areas of research. 1. Develop and investigate              
statistical models for biological population data. Biological data are          
always collected from some population of different individuals, and are         
often highly variable. This is mostly due to variability of physiological       
functions between individuals, and to measurement error. Statistical            
models are needed to deal with the complex structure of population data. I      
will (I) introduce a general methodology based on the use of sophisticated      
heteroscedastic statistical models, which does not explicitly formulate a       
model for interindividual variability but promises to be fast, efficient        
and unbiased; and (ii) investigate the performance of existing population       
models using realistic simulations including model misspecification. 2.         
Develop semi-mechanistic compartmental models. I focus on three main            
problems: (i) the development and investigation a new general class of          
compartmental pharmacokinetics""'pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models, (ii) the        
development of semi-mechanistic black-box compartmental models to deal          
with non-linear PK systems, (iii) the development of the technology to          
apply well established semi-mechanistic linear black-box models to the          
purpose of PK control. 3. Develop new multivariate dynamic models. The          
main problem addressed is how to represent a system where multiple inputs       
(drugs) and multiple interrelated responses are measured. I propose             
different classes of models to do so based on spline networks and               
eventually neural networks. The proposed models can incorporate a               
compartmental sub-structure to easily deal with kinetics. Continuous and        
discrete time versions of the models are considered. The statistical and        
mathematical models introduced in the grant have widespread application to      
a variety of biological fields. However specific areas, directly linked to      
health care issues, are selected for active research and application of         
the proposed models. These areas correspond to experimental situations

"The overall goal of this research program is to investigate the role of         
parent behavior on the development of repetitive arm, hand, and finger          
movements in young infants-gestures that have recently been studied as          
an analog to infant vocal babble. Specifically, this project will               
investigate the responsiveness of parents to these repetitive infant            
gestures and will experimentally test the role of parental reinforcement        
on their production over time. Taking a Dynamic Systems approach, the           
overall hypothesis is that children are born with innate predispositions        
to produce behaviors that appear to adults as very speech- or sign-like-        
repetitive vocalizations and gestures, respectively. As children mature,        
they have an expanding ""pool' of motor behaviors that may be used in            
various contexts. In contexts where these behaviors are functional (e.g.        
parents respond to and reinforce them), they are maintained and continue        
to pull from the available pool. In contexts where they are not                 
functional, they do not change and eventually drop out. The present             
project will consist of two longitudinal small-sample studies and one           
large-sample study of adult responsiveness to repetitive infant gestures.       
In Study 1 of the present project, the responses of hearing parents to          
repetitive gestures produced by their hearing infants from 6 to 12 months       
of age will be studied and compared to those of deaf, American Sign             
Language (ASL)-signing parents of deaf infants. These data will provide         
information about the natural responses of parents, both hearing and            
deaf, to repetitive babble-like gestures produced by young infants. In          
Study 2, the ability of hearing, nonsigning adults to identify repetitive       
infant gestures from a ""background' of ongoing infant motor activity will       
be assessed. These data will provide new information about the potential        
of hearing adults to recognize babble-like gestures in young infants. In        
Study 3, the effect of parent reinforcement on repetitive infant gestures       
will be experimentally tested by training hearing parents to provide            
social reinforcement for nonreferential repetitive gestures produced by         
their hearing infants between 6 and 16 months of age. These data will           
inform our models of language learning by examining the role of parent          
responsitivity in the development of a manual form of prelinguistic             
babble and provide clinically relevant information about gestural parent-

parent behavior on the development of repetitive arm, hand, and finger          
movements in young infants-gestures that have recently been studied as          
an analog to infant vocal babble. Specifically, this project will               
investigate the responsiveness of parents to these repetitive infant            
gestures and will experimentally test the role of parental reinforcement        
on their production over time. Taking a Dynamic Systems approach, the           
overall hypothesis is that children are born with innate predispositions        
to produce behaviors that appear to adults as very speech- or sign-like-        
repetitive vocalizations and gestures, respectively. As children mature,        
they have an expanding ""pool' of motor behaviors that may be used in            
various contexts. In contexts where these behaviors are functional (e.g.        
parents respond to and reinforce them), they are maintained and continue        
to pull from the available pool. In contexts where they are not                 
functional, they do not change and eventually drop out. The present             
project will consist of two longitudinal small-sample studies and one           
large-sample study of adult responsiveness to repetitive infant gestures.       
In Study 1 of the present project, the responses of hearing parents to          
repetitive gestures produced by their hearing infants from 6 to 12 months       
of age will be studied and compared to those of deaf, American Sign             
Language (ASL)-signing parents of deaf infants. These data will provide         
information about the natural responses of parents, both hearing and            
deaf, to repetitive babble-like gestures produced by young infants. In          
Study 2, the ability of hearing, nonsigning adults to identify repetitive       
infant gestures from a ""background' of ongoing infant motor activity will       
be assessed. These data will provide new information about the potential        
of hearing adults to recognize babble-like gestures in young infants. In        
Study 3, the effect of parent reinforcement on repetitive infant gestures       
will be experimentally tested by training hearing parents to provide            
social reinforcement for nonreferential repetitive gestures produced by         
their hearing infants between 6 and 16 months of age. These data will           
inform our models of language learning by examining the role of parent          
responsitivity in the development of a manual form of prelinguistic             
babble and provide clinically relevant information about gestural parent-       
child interaction-important to programs encouraging gestural                    
communication between hearing parents and deaf children.
