"The electronic medical record (EMR) holds great allure to both the
 medical informatics and health services research communities. In this
 project, we propose to enhance the capability of electronic medical
 record (EMR) systems by creating and evaluating tools to extract
 clinical vocabularies as well as patient data from narrative text
 reports. We will apply advanced natural language processing tools from
 the CLARIT system to both of the above problems. We contend that fast
 and robust automated text processing methods are the only way that the
 problems of vocabulary construction and narrative text extraction can
 be solved.
 
 We will address the clinical vocabulary problem by utilizing the
 thesaurus extraction techniques already present in the CLARIT system.
 Using several gigabytes of narrative text, including discharge
 summaries, progress notes, radiology reports, and other clinical text,
 we plan to:
 l. Identify empirically the terminology used in medicine.
 2. Compare the coverage of that terminology in several existing large
 medical vocabularies: UMLS, SNOMED, and the Medical Entities
 Dictionary.
 3. Discern the semantic characteristics of that terminology to allow
 other structured vocabularies a richer substrate of terms as well as
 providing us the opportunity to implement a clinical vocabulary schema
 based on the methods of the MedSORT-II Project.
 4. Evaluate how well our tools assist the vocabulary building efforts
 of ourselves and others.
 
 The narrative extraction problem will be approached differently than
 in the past, building on the efforts of previous investigators who
 have tackled this problem before but changing the perspective by
 focusing on the development of tools specific to researchers and
 others with a need to extract data from narrative text. This approach
 will be applied in two domains:
 l.Consortium-based research in the use of esophogastroduodenoscopy
 (EGD).
 2.Practice guidelines implementation in blood product transfusion.

"Heart disease is a vital health care problem, affecting millions of
 Americans each year. Clinical decisions regarding the diagnosis of heart
 disease rely on determining the amount of diseased myocardium,with
 myocardial perfusion imaging representing the most widespread clinical
 procedure for assessing myocardial infarction and/or ischemia. However,
 interpreting this image information, and integrating it with other
 clinical data, remains a difficult and ill-defined problem. With this in
 mind, this competing renewal application proposes to continue a research
 program with the overall objective of developing a clinically useful,
 computer-based methodology to aid in the diagnosis of heart disease.  The
 methodology consists of a novel framework combining well established
 mathematical methods, visualization techniques, and artificial
 intelligence approaches for representing medical knowledge and integrating
 visual, numeric, textual, and temporal information. The principal
 hypothesis underlying the research is that medical decision-making tasks
 involving multidimensional information can be facilitated through the
 integration of both basic and applied concepts of medical informatics.
 
 During this next funding period, we propose to continue focussing our
 efforts on the development, implementation, and validation of this
 methodology through these specific aims: (1) automatic determination of
 the orientation of the left ventricular myocardium; (2) extension and
 enhancement of a knowledge base for interpreting myocardial perfusion
 imagery and other relevant information; (3) prediction of resting
 perfusion from resting thickening distributions through connectionist
 methods; (4) integration of connectionist and symbolic methods; (5)
 implementation and automation of the methodology into a fully integrated
 system; and (6) clinical testing and evaluation of this system. The
 extensive technical progress thus far achieved in these aims during the
 initial funding period is strong evidence of the merits of this highly
 interdisciplinary and interinstitutional research program.

"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer morality      
in men and women in the United States, and the overall long-term survial is

a good prognosis.  However, cancer relapse and death rate in this subset is     
35 to 50% by 5 years.  Chemotherapy is beneficial for the treatment of

in the treatment of patients with stage I NSCLC.  Thr purpose of this           
project is to define tissue and serum tumor markers in patients with stage      
I NSCLC which predict for early cancer recurrence.  Pathologic stage I

retrospective cohort of 275 stage I NSCLC patients.  Markers are                
categorized by hypothetical method of action: molecular genetic markers

titers of serum markers and tumor histology, stage or mass.  One hundred        
patients in this cohort had a second serum collection after tumor

"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most disabling              
psychopathological conditions affecting the veteran population.                 
Approximately 15.2% of the men and 8.5% of the women stationed in               
Vietnam were found to be suffering from PTSD 15 or more years after             
their service. In the Atlanta metropolitan area, some 9000 Vietnam              
veterans suffer from complete or partial PTSD. The psychological,               
social, occupational and economic consequences of the disorder for              
patients and their families are devastating. No therapeutic approach            
has proven to be consistently effective in the management of combat-            
related PTSD. The present proposal intends to exploit the potential             
therapeutic effectiveness of recent advances in computer and display            
technology referred to as Virtual Reality. Virtual reality exposure             
(VRE) takes place in an immersive, computer-driven environment.                 
Patients would be exposed to virtual Huey helicopters flying them over          
the jungles of Vietnam.  They will be encouraged to relive their                
traumatic memories, much as in standard exposure therapy, but immersed          
in Vietnam stimuli. Ultimate control is possible in the virtual                 
environment, changing levels of intensity of exposure instantly. The            
proposed project aims to develop virtual reality exposure therapy for           
Vietnam veterans with PTSD, revise and perfect the treatment,                   
construct a treatment manual, and gather preliminary evidence of its            
efficacy in a small group design. A series of five case studies will            
be run to develop and revise the treatment. Following this, Vietnam             
veterans (n=40) with current DSM-IV PTSD diagnoses will be randomly             
assigned to VRE or a wait-list control. Treatment will be delivered

Assessments will be conducted at pre-treatment, post-treatment and              
follow-ups of 6 and 12 months post-treatment. Assessments will be               
conducted by an independent assessor who will be kept blind to the              
treatment condition. Objective clinician-rated and self report

psychopathological conditions affecting the veteran population.                 
Approximately 15.2% of the men and 8.5% of the women stationed in               
Vietnam were found to be suffering from PTSD 15 or more years after             
their service. In the Atlanta metropolitan area, some 9000 Vietnam              
veterans suffer from complete or partial PTSD. The psychological,               
social, occupational and economic consequences of the disorder for              
patients and their families are devastating. No therapeutic approach            
has proven to be consistently effective in the management of combat-            
related PTSD. The present proposal intends to exploit the potential             
therapeutic effectiveness of recent advances in computer and display            
technology referred to as Virtual Reality. Virtual reality exposure             
(VRE) takes place in an immersive, computer-driven environment.                 
Patients would be exposed to virtual Huey helicopters flying them over          
the jungles of Vietnam.  They will be encouraged to relive their                
traumatic memories, much as in standard exposure therapy, but immersed          
in Vietnam stimuli. Ultimate control is possible in the virtual                 
environment, changing levels of intensity of exposure instantly. The            
proposed project aims to develop virtual reality exposure therapy for           
Vietnam veterans with PTSD, revise and perfect the treatment,                   
construct a treatment manual, and gather preliminary evidence of its            
efficacy in a small group design. A series of five case studies will            
be run to develop and revise the treatment. Following this, Vietnam             
veterans (n=40) with current DSM-IV PTSD diagnoses will be randomly             
assigned to VRE or a wait-list control. Treatment will be delivered             
in nine 60-minute individual sessions conducted over 5 weeks.                   
Assessments will be conducted at pre-treatment, post-treatment and              
follow-ups of 6 and 12 months post-treatment. Assessments will be

"DESCRIPTION:(Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract) The goal of this         
grant is to determine if and when cancer risks can be estimated by              
establishing record-linkages between statewide cancer surveillance systems      
and occupational cohorts.  More specifically, the aims of this study are to:    
(1) determine the feasibility of utilizing statewide cancer surveillance        
systems in the evaluation of cancer incidence within occupational cohorts;      
(2) compare and contrast the relative merits of standardized incidence          
ratios (SIR) with standardized mortality ratios (SMR) as determined from        
cancer surveillance systems incidence data and death certificate mortality      
data, respectively; and (3) provide recommendations concerning how and when     
statewide cancer surveillance systems should be utilized in the evaluation      
of occupational cohorts.                                                        
                                                                                
SMR and SIR estimates will be calculated and compared for three occupational    
cohorts (e.g., Highway Maintenance, 3M, Conwed).  SMR analyses have already     
been completed for the Highway Maintenance and 3M cohorts; a mortality          
update and SMR analysis will be conducted for the Conwed cohort (1988-1995).    
Cancer morbidity information, for the SIR analysis, will be determined by       
linking the three cohorts with the Minnesota Cancer Surveillance System         
(MCSS).  Residency status will be required before person-years can be           
calculated, however, because inclusion in the MCSS is restricted to             
Minnesota residents.  Linkages to other data sets will be used to determine     
the Minnesota residency status.  Sensitivity analyses will be used to           
evaluate confounding and follow-up bias.  Standardized mortality ratios will    
be compared to standardized incidence ratios for the Highway Maintenance,       
3M, and Conwed cohorts.  Finally, this study will evaluate the utility and      
limitations of cancer surveillance systems as a tool for occupational cancer    
research; recommendations for its use will be developed.
