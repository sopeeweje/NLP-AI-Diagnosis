"Our overall objective is to solve the problem of how proteins fold into         
their native conformations.  For this purpose, we are using the                 
methodology of protein chemistry and developing and applying experimental       
and theoretical techniques to provide an understanding of the internal          
interactions that stabilize native proteins in aqueous solution.  This          
project is concerned with the theoretical work which involves the use of        
empirical potentials (including the effects of hydration and entropy) in        
various computational approaches to study the interactions in protein           
folding.  Emphasis is currently being placed on solving the multiple-           
minima problem arising from the existence of numerous local minima in the       
potential energy surface of the protein, the objective being to locate the      
global minimum on this surface.  An understanding of the interactions in        
proteins is of potential applicability to the elucidation of the role of        
conformation in biological processes, e.g. the undesirable association of       
sickle-cell hemoglobin, or the induction of an oncogene product whose           
properties involve a conformational change when only one amino acid             
residue in the sequence is changed.

basic research skills and to prepare her for independent                        
investigations directed at exploring and dissecting the neural bases of         
motor and related dysfunctions in neurological disorders and normal

who has worked in the field of motor control for over 25 years will             
serve as co-mentor. Dr. Glyn Johnson, experienced physicist in the              
field of magnetic resonance, will serve as consultant to instruct the           
applicant in functional MRI. Drs. Jim Moeller and Eva Petkova will              
further the applicant's education in advanced statistics. Dr. Vijay

Research plan: The goal of this study is to characterize changes in             
neural processing underlying implicit and explicit forms of motor               
learning in patients with Parkinson's disease and in a control normal           
aging population. A new family of motor tasks developed in Dr. Ghez's           
lab will be used during 150-H2O positron emission tomography. A new             
analytical methodology based on principal component analysis will be            
applied on measures of regional blood flow to determine how inter-              
subject differences in motor learning are reflected in modulations of           
brain network expression. These same methods will be used to                    
determine the neural bases of two therapeutic inventions in

"This proposed research will conduct a randomized trials to test an innovative and interactive and proactive secondary prevention program for college students to reduce high risk alcohol behaviors and minimize alcohol related problems. High volume episodic or ""binge"" drinking is a major problem on most college campuses. But most students do not perceive their high risk alcohol behaviors as problematic, and few are prepared to change those behaviors. Effective interventions are needed that can impact on an entire population of students at risk for alcohol problems. Such interventions should be theory based and capable of being delivered at a low cost to large segments of the at-risk population. The proposed study is an evaluation of the efficacy of a computerized expert system intervention designed to reduce alcohol problem behaviors, and is based on the conceptual framework of the Transtheoretical Model. Over the past decade researchers at the University of Rhode Island (URI) have developed and tested self-help prevention interventions using expert system technology that provides individualized feedback on some of the most powerful variables known to influence behavior change. These interactive interventions are matched to an individual's stage of motivational readiness to change, and have demonstrated unprecedented impacts in a series of large scale clinical trials of smoking cessation and other health behaviors. This study focuses on students during a high risk transition period-the freshman and sophomore years, and will target drinkers and second year URI students will be assessed by telephone to determine eligibility. 1,420 subjects are expected to participate. A three group randomized controlled design will a brief intervention condition that provides three report expert system feedback reports with two control conditions; a minimal assessment post-test only control and an assessment only condition. All groups will be assessed at 12, 18 and 24 months. In addition, the intervention and the assessment only control will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Multiple measures of drinking rates, alcohol behaviors, and alcohol-related problems will be the primary outcomes for the efficacy evaluation. This project is designed to be rapidly disseminable so that results may be used in public health efforts to decrease the incidence of, and problems associated with, high risk drinking among college students.  alcoholic beverage consumption; alcoholism /alcohol abuse education; alcoholism /alcohol abuse prevention; artificial intelligence; behavior modification; behavioral /social science research tag; clinical research; computer assisted instruction; computer assisted patient care; high risk behavior /lifestyle; human subject; questionnaires; self care; substance abuse related behavior; university student; young adult human (21-34) A PROACTIVE INDIVIDUALIZED PROGRAM FOR COLLEGE DRINKERS","This proposed research will conduct a randomized trials to test an innovative and interactive and proactive secondary prevention program for college students to reduce high risk alcohol behaviors and minimize alcohol related problems.
