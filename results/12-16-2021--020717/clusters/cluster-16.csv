"The primary objective of this Data Analysis grant proposal is to employ         
and evaluate the ability of Neural networks to serve as clinical tools for      
predicting clinical coronary events.  Several methods will be employed to       
adapt neural networks for survival analysis, and data from town ling-term       
clinical studies will be used to develop neural networks which evaluate         
coronary artery disease risk.  The Specific Aims for this proposal are:         
                                                                                
Specific Aim 1 (Relation between Angiographic Progression of Coronary           
Artery Atherosclerosis using Quantitative Coronary Angiography and              
Clinical Coronary Events in CLAS): Neural networks will be developed            
utilizing quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) measures of coronary          
change.                                                                         
                                                                                
Specific Aim 2 (Relation between Risk Factors and Serum Lipid Values and        
Clinical Coronary Events in the LRCCPPT): Neural networks will also be          
developed utilizing information of serum Lipid values available in the          
Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial results (LRCCPPT       
Results, 1984a and Appendix B).                                                 
                                                                                
Specific Aim 3 (Evaluation of Methods which Adapt neural Networks to            
Survival Analysis): Existing neural Network designs cannot readily              
incorporate the censored observations which exist in long-term clinical         
studies.  Methods developed by our research team (Lapuerta, Azen and            
LaBree, 1995; and Buckley and James, 1979) provide approaches which can be      
used to address this problem.

"The overall objective of this Phase I SBIR effort is to design a                
personally customized, interactive multimedia expert system for                 
promotion of exercise programs among chronically ill elderly patients,

built as a specialized module on top of a comprehensive,multimedia              
distributed network computer system for ""Continuously Available Medical         
Care"" (CAMC) focused on the needs of chronically ill patients. Using the        
advanced CAMC Tool Kit scripting and expert system language. physicians         
will input medical condition parameters and patients will provide               
personal preferences and home/living factors, then the PIE software will        
create a customized training and monitoring CD-R0M which accounts for           
medical problem factors such as diabetes and peripheral vascular                
disease. Multimedia video training, rules for progression of exercise           
and live videoconferencing to physicians and exercise trainers will be          
features of the PIE system. As part of this Phase I effort, a prototype

PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The market for PIE modules and products        
is substantial. The marginal value of PIE to the CAMC homecare system           
is approximately $100 per year; for the 1 million high cost illness             
patients this totals $100 million per year as a market. Even if LG&A            
reaches only several percent, this is very attractive annual recurring          
revenue base with high net income after the first few years. Sales of

patients, priced at $750 (as an example) per primary care physician to          
a market with 300,000 potential buyers is also a several hundred million
