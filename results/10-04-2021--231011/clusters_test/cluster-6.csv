"Molecular characterization of extracellular vesicles for the spread of misfolded tau protein Neurofibrillary tangles, composed of intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (tau), are by far the most correlated pathology for clinical symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD). Emerging evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs, such as exosomes and microvesicles), transfer pathological tau between cells as vehicles, propagating tau pathology. It is urgently important to find the molecular basis of brain-derived EVs, which may critically regulate EV uptake by neurons and aggregation of tau protein in EVs and/or recipient neurons. We have recently established the method for isolating EVs from human brain samples and successfully performed their proteomic profiling. We found that selective molecules from the EV proteomics datasets were able to differentiate human AD-EV from healthy control (CTRL)-EV with 88% accuracy by machine learning analysis, confirming pathogenic character of AD-EV molecules. Furthermore, our exciting preliminary data have shown that AD-EV have significantly higher tau seeding activity compared to CTRL-EV by FRET sensor tau seeding assay with subsets of EV molecules showing significant association with tau seeding activity. This proposed project will fortify these preliminary results and find the converging or specific mechanisms among tauopathies for mediating tau aggregation and its seeding via EV uptake through proteomics and biological examination of brain-derived EV samples. To meet this challenge, we assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators who have a strong record of accomplishments in biologic (Ikezu), proteomic (Emili) and bioengineering and bioinformatic analysis (Issador). In Aim1, we will examine EV samples from 240 new brain specimens (40 AD, 40 CTE, 40 LBD, 40 PSP, 40 CBD and 40 CTRL) for precision mass-spectrometry-based proteomics and tau-interactomes, and analyze those datasets by the machine learning approach. Aim 2 will examine the efficiency of tau propagation using tau fibrils, oligomers and EVs isolated from the same donors of the 5 different tauopathies and control cases in vitro and in vivo using FRET-based tau seeding assay and EV uptake by primary cultured mouse cortical neurons in vitro. EV-associated tau will be further characterized by the biochemical and microscopy-based analysis for their conformational and posttranslational changes. We will evaluate the difference in tau propagation after the intracranial injection of the tau seeds from different tauopathy brains using our recently established mouse models. Aim3 will identify candidate molecules most likely involved in EV uptake and tau seeding activity by bioinformatic analysis of the proteome dataset (Aim 1) and biological datasets (Aim 2). We will then test the functional roles of the identified molecules on EV uptake, tau seeding activities and neuronal firing activities in vitro. The candidate molecules will be specifically targeted by gene silencing or antagonists for their therapeutic potential to halt tau propagation in vitro and in vivo. Successful identification of responsible molecules for tau propagation will serve as a foundation for understanding EV-mediated disease progression. We propose to achieve highly comprehensive characterization of the protein composition of extracellular vesicles in human brain tissues, and determine their emerging roles on enhancing neuronal uptake of vesicle associated tau and spread of tau pathology in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. The candidate molecules will be specifically targeted by specific antagonistic reagents for their therapeutic potential for halting tau propagation in vivo. These studies will lead to a better understanding of vesicle-mediated disease spread mechanism in Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathy.",Molecular characterization of extracellular vesicles for the spread of misfolded tau protein,10130196,R01AG067763,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Atomic Force Microscopy', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biosensor', 'Brain', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Cells', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Endocytosis', 'Energy Transfer', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Inflammation', 'Injections', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'MAPT gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Target', 'Mus', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'Tauopathies', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transfection', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vesicle', 'abnormally phosphorylated tau', 'aged', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'case control', 'chronic traumatic encephalopathy', 'corticobasal degeneration', 'differential expression', 'disorder control', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'gray matter', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'microvesicles', 'mouse model', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'multidisciplinary', 'non-demented', 'protein protein interaction', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'transmission process', 'uptake']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R01,2021,625498
"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,10204729,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data repository', 'experience', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'web portal']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,639861
"Rapid Evaluation of Neuronal Activity in the Intact Whole Brain at Single Cell Resolution Project Summary  Here we seek to develop a “Neuronal Activity Quantitative Diagnostic” platform and reagent kits to disseminate accessible products for measuring recent neural activity across the entire mouse brain to the neuroscience community. Previously we have shown that the activity-dependent immediate-early gene protein products Npas4 and cFos can be clearly detected, imaged, and quantified using developmental versions of our platform tools. Immediate early genes are genes that are activated transiently and rapidly in response to a wide variety of cellular stimuli. The three overlapping aims to be investigated in this Phase II project are:  1) Demonstration of the fidelity of our assay for our customers. To demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our neuronal activity assay with another well-known assay for activity, we will perform two photon calcium fluorescence imaging in the primary visual cortex of mice presented with repeated visual stimuli. We will clear and stain the brains for cFos and Npas4 and demonstrate the fidelity of these markers for detecting recently active neurons.  2) Develop and beta test robust versions of our software tools useable by researchers with no specialized coding or statistics knowledge. We will develop Stitchy and BrainSnap into robust, user-friendly software products that remove the current analysis bottleneck for neuroscientists interested in whole-brain imaging. Stitchy will be an improved browser-based version of our internal software that simplifies and speeds the process of stitching together light sheet microscope images. BrainSnap software will integrate our high-performance 3TK- Quant framework for machine learning-enabled quantification and our statistical framework for whole-brain anatomics, 3TK-Stats, in a browser-based interface. We have recruited end users who will test this software in a head-to-head comparison with our in-house testing.  3) Develop and test a brain clearing and staining kit for neuronal activity. To help researchers produce high quality cleared brains stained with neuronal activity markers, we will generate Neuronal Activity clearing and staining reagents kits for cFos and Npas4. These will be tested by collaborators in head-to-head comparisons with our in-house procedures on brains prepared in parallel.  At the end of Phase II, Translucence will have a market-ready Neuronal Activity Quantitative Diagnostic platform including reagent kits, user-friendly software, and service options. Project Narrative Translucence uses cutting-edge technology to make brains optically clear coupled with computational tools to map and quantify neuronal activity at single-cell resolution across the entire mouse brain.

"The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis A comprehensive understanding of nervous system function requires integration of multiple types of data, from behavioral to anatomical. Ultimately function can be reduced to the patterns of connectivity between cells and the activation of single neurons. In this application we propose a set of aims that makes use of a unique organism with optimal qualities for multimodal nervous system investigation: the simple chordate, Ciona intestinalis. The anatomy of the Ciona larval tadpole CNS shows strong conservation with the CNS of the vertebrates, including homologs of the forebrain, midbrain/hindbrain, and spinal cord. Despite these conserved vertebrate-like features the Ciona tadpole is barely 1 mm long and has only ~2500 cells. Moreover the tadpole CNS has only 177 neurons. While the development of the Ciona CNS has been the subject of investigation for many years, new research opportunities have opened with the recent completion of the Ciona tadpole CNS connectome from serial section electron microscopy. The overall goal of this proposal is to build from the connectome data to identify correlates of behavior at the level of single, identifiable neurons. This project will be the combined undertaking of three research groups with expertise in Ciona live imaging and transgenesis, computer vision and image analysis, and electron microscopy and Ciona neuroanatomy. Preliminary data presented here demonstrate that the transparency and small size of Ciona tadpoles make them ideal for live imaging of brain activity using genetically encoded Ca2+ or voltage indicators. The aims of this proposal will be, first, to expand Ciona as a model of nervous system function, including a detailed characterization of behavior, the generation of a brain atlas at cellular resolution, and the quantification of stereotypy in brain cellular anatomy and connectivity; and, second, to apply these new tools in the characterization of patterns of neuronal activity as Ciona larvae respond to sensory cues by taking advantage of state-of-the-art imaging and neural activity detection methods. The connectome makes specific and novel predictions about patterns of neural activity, and the relative simplicity of the Ciona CNS will provide an innovative system for validating such predictions. This project presents challenges in image acquisition, analysis, and multimodal integration that stretch the limits of current technology, but holds the potential to provide an unparalleled view of chordate CNS function spanning multiple levels, from behavioral to synaptic. The central nervous system plays an central role in human health yet remains one of the most poorly understood organ systems. To gain insight into how patterns of cell connectivity and activation produce behaviors we will use advanced light and electron imaging methods to explore one of the simplest chordate brains, that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis.","The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis",10134450,R01NS103774,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Ciona intestinalis', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Play', 'Prosencephalon', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Sensory', 'Sepharose', 'Sister', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stretching', 'Subcellular Anatomy', 'Swimming', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Urochordata', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'body system', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'confocal imaging', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'detection method', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'hindbrain', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'microscopic imaging', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'stereotypy', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2021,527956
"Understanding the regulation of neuron cell number and arbor size PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT How the brain generates the correct number of neurons and how these neurons determine the size of their arbors to innervate the receptor field is a critical question in neurobiology. The Drosophila visual system is hard wired and iteratively organized into columns, providing an excellent model to answer these questions. Drosophila medulla multicolumnar neurons exhibit 5 to 750 neurons per cell type; each neuron class possesses a distinct morphology and projects its arbors across multiple columns in the optic lobe. The host lab has obtained single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data that determined the transcriptome of almost all optic lobe neuron cell types throughout development. The first aim of this project is to understand the molecular and cell biological mechanisms that dictate neuron number. Under the mentorship of Claude Desplan at New York University (K99 phase), I will perform genetics experiments that decisively address the role of programmed cell death, neural stem cell division number, and neuroepithelial size of origin in regulating the number of multicolumnar neurons produced. I will also perform lineage tracing experiments to determine whether molecularly similar cell types are generated at the same time. With Holger Knaut at NYU Medical Center, I will learn quantitative live imaging techniques to distinguish whether neural stem cells divide a limited number of times to generate low-abundance neural classes, or whether cell fusion of immature progenitors drives cell number. The second aim of this project is to determine the morphological and genetic processes that dictate the size and orientation of the arbors of multicolumnar to allow them to cover distinct receptor fields. With the bioinformatics expertise of Itai Yanai at NYU Medical Center, I will perform RNAseq on adult neurons that are not numerous enough to be identified in our existing scRNAseq data sets. I will then use machine learning algorithms to identify these neurons during development in our existing scRNAseq libraries and thus identify candidate genes required for the regulation of neuron number and arbor size (R00 phase). I will combine these molecular experiments with live imaging to quantitatively characterize how multicolumnar neurons determine the orientation and size of their arbors. Preliminary data indicates that cell death and the size of neuroepithelial region of origin in part dictate multicolumnar neuron number; I have also identified a neuropeptide whose function is essential for the regulation of neuron arbor size. My work will clarify the molecular basis of neuron abundance and determine how neurons present in small numbers regulate their arbor size to ensure that their environment is uniformly sampled, a problem common to many brain regions in most species. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding how neurons are generated in the correct numbers and how they appropriately space their arbors is of relevance to the fields of developmental neurobiology, neurology and regenerative medicine. Failure to properly specify or target neurons may cause congenital neurological diseases, and our work may identify molecular targets used for treatment. Comprehension of how neurons are made and how they target is also of relevance to regenerative medicine, as stem cell therapies will soon be able to generate diverse neural types which may be transplanted to treat blindness, brain injury and neurodegeneration.",Understanding the regulation of neuron cell number and arbor size,10104237,K99EY032269,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Death Inhibition', 'Cell fusion', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Ganglia', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Processes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inhibition of Apoptosis', 'Kinetics', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Maps', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Mutate', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuroepithelial', 'Neurology', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neuropil', 'New York', 'Optic Lobe', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Photoreceptors', 'Population', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Transcript', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'cell type', 'developmental neurobiology', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'genetic manipulation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nerve stem cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroblast', 'neuroepithelium', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinotopic', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'somatosensory', 'stem cell division', 'stem cell therapy', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'two-photon']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,140333
"Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory role in neural circuitry and pathology. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. All these results provide strong rationale for modeling and analyzing astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets. Recent advances in the modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetic encoded calcium indicators (GECI) have enabled optical recording of astrocytic calcium dynamics – the excitatory state and functional readout of astrocytes – in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Compared to the great experimental capability of generating tremendous volumes of astrocyte functional data, the development of computational tools to analyze and interpret the complex and big data is lagged far behind, which has severely jeopardized a deeper understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes. To address the pressing need, we thus propose to develop sophisticated computational tools for interpreting the complex calcium dynamics data, through judicious application of advanced machine learning and systems theories. We have the following three specific aim. Aim1). Developing computational tools to analyze the cellular properties of calcium signaling in a single astrocyte. Aim2). Developing computational tools to analyze the network properties of calcium signaling in a population of astrocytes. Aim3). Validating experimentally the computational tools, developing optimal experiment protocol and disseminating the software packages. Our preliminary studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our plans and highlight the potential of analyzing astrocyte functional activity to understand neuronal circuitry and pathology, including for the first time the surprising discovery of hyper-activity in Down’s syndrome astrocytes compared to the normal astrocytes. This proposal is built on pre-established collaboration between two groups with the much needed complementary expertise for accomplishing this project, (1) computational scientists (Yu lab at Virginia Tech) and (2) experimental neuroscientists (Tian lab at UC Davis). The pre-established working relationships, developed channels of communication and mechanisms for resource sharing will help insure that the work will proceed in an efficient and effective manner. Project Narrative Although astrocytes, the most abundant glia cells in the brain, have been proposed to play important roles in the neural circuitry, our understanding of the physiological roles of astrocyte in neural circuitry is very limited partially due to the lack of sophisticated computational tools to analyze the complex astrocyte calcium data. We thus propose to apply advanced machine learning and systems theories to address the pressing need. Deep understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes in health and disease will translate into identifying novel therapeutic avenues for treatment of brain disorders.",Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools,10102648,R01MH110504,"['Address', 'Astrocytes', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'In Vitro', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Peer Review', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'complex data', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'multidisciplinary', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimmunology', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2021,488894
"Water and chloride movement in neurons during seizure activity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There are no pharmacological treatments for cytotoxic edema, which is a common consequence of multiple brain insults, including hypoxic-ischemic and traumatic brain injury, stroke, metabolic derangements, and seizures. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), with an incidence of 1.5 of every 1,000 live births, is a type of brain damage in newborns caused by oxygen deprivation and limited blood flow. HIE is associated with seizures, and both correlate with long-term morbidity, including cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, epilepsy, vision loss, and deafness. HIE and neonatal seizures result in cytotoxic edema, which is characterized by the accumulation of water, chloride (Cl-), and other ions. The mechanisms of water movement that make neurons swell during the neonatal period are unknown. There is a critical need to determine how water moves into neurons that result and perpetuate neuronal swelling during the neonatal period, as there are no direct treatments for cytotoxic edema at this age. Knowing the pathways of water movement in neurons is the first step to develop innovative ways to treat cytotoxic edema, which will prevent neuronal cell death and improve the treatment of neonatal seizures. Neurons do not have water channels to allow the movement of water. Multiple pathways have been described in different cell types, but it is unknown which ones participate during the neonatal period. Our long- term goal is to identify the mechanisms of neuronal swelling in the developing brain and how this swelling results in neuronal death. Our central hypothesis for this proposal is that specific cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) move water, along with Cl-, in and out of neurons during cytotoxic edema in the neonatal period. This hypothesis is based on our data demonstrating the linked movement of water and Cl- in neurons during cytotoxic edema. We will test our hypothesis through two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the pathway of water movement into neurons during swelling in the neonatal period. Aim 2 will determine the paths of water movement out of cortical neurons that prevent progressive swelling during the neonatal period. We will use multiphoton imaging techniques to measure changes in neuronal size and their Cl- concentration during swelling in different transgenic mouse lines expressing both Cl- sensitive and insensitive fluorophores, in vitro, and in vivo, while altering the CCC function either pharmacologically or through genetic manipulation. Also, we will use a novel deep learning algorithm to analyze the changes in neuronal size during swelling. Our studies will uncover fundamental mechanisms on how neurons swell and what mechanisms prevent progressive swelling during early brain development. Our results will have a broad impact as they will open new research avenues on neuronal volume regulation in the newborn and will guide the development of drugs targeting cytotoxic edema, which are currently lacking. Moreover, our results will apply to other severe brain injuries in children that are associated with cytotoxic edema and elevated neuronal Cl- concentration, including trauma, and stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on determining the pathways that lead to water accumulation during cytotoxic edema, a pathological state observed in multiple neurological injuries of the newborn, resulting in cell death and difficult to treat seizures. Once the pathways are identified, there is the potential for significant advancement in the treatment of neuronal swelling, which is currently lacking.

"Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers Disease The entorhinal cortex (EC) is long known to be the region affected first in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with symptoms such as disorientation, confusion and inability to navigate appearing early in life. But more recently, a region in the brainstem- locus coeruleus (LC) was found to have tau accumulation in young healthy adults, making it the first region in the brain with AD pathology. The LC is known to be important for arousal and controls the sleep/wake switch. The neurons of LC project to several regions including EC and hippocampus which are known to be important for spatial memory. Unsurprisingly, one of the earliest symptoms of AD is spatial difficulties and it is possible that early pathology in LC affects sleep leading to spatial memory deficits. With both LC and EC important for memory, we aim to identify which of them is more vulnerable to tau and Aβ pathology. To explore this possibility, we will first inject LC and EC regions of wildtype mouse with pathological tau derived from human AD brains to make them dysfunctional, and evaluate their neuronal function. We will also assess sleep and test memory performance in relevant behavior tasks. To understand how aβ affects tau pathology, we will inject human tau in the APP Knock-In mice which has physiological amounts of APP expressed in them. We will determine if Aβ together with tau worsens the neuronal function of LC and EC neurons and it sleep and memory is impaired further. We will use multi-region silicon probes to simultaneously record activity from LC or medial EC and hippocampal neurons. The MEC and hippocampal neurons are well characterized with properties that can be easily measured using spatial navigation tasks. We will make use of virtual reality head-fixed setup for the animals to navigate in, and allowing us to quickly test animal’s memory in any context and environment. The animals will be tested for object-location memory and context-dependent memory in virtual environment. We will use machine learning algorithms to decode animal’s position in the LC, MEC and HPC neural data and determine if it is affected by tau or Aβ or both. We will also assess sleep parameters and correlate with memory. We hypothesize that tau in LC and EC will make its neurons dysfunctional and directly affect sleep and memory, and this in concert with Aβ will exacerbate neuronal dysfunction leading to increased sleep problems and spatial memory impairment as seen in early AD. With this we aim to identify electrophysiological biomarker of neuronal dysfunction before the onset of behavioral troubles. We will test if increasing the neuronal firing in hypoactive neurons and reducing the firing in hyperactive neurons will restore downstream neuronal dysfunction and reverse sleep problems and cognitive impairment. The proposal brings together diverse fields (neuroscience, pathology and computational neuroscience) applying large-scale recording techniques simultaneously across multiple brain regions to develop analytical and predictive tests to interrogate function in vulnerable brain regions that are dysfunctional in AD. The locus coeruleus and the entorhinal cortex region of the brain are among the first to be affected in Alzheimer’s disease, causing sleep problems and cognitive dysfunction. Using multi-region recording probes we will evaluate their function to determine which one of them is more vulnerable to tau and aβ pathology. We will test if by using optogenetic approach the neurons in these regions can be rescued and cognitive deficits be reversed.",Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers Disease,10142333,R01AG064066,"['20 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Disorientation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mus', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Quick Test for Liver Function', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Silicon', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive testing', 'computational neuroscience', 'entorhinal cortex', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'neuron loss', 'non rapid eye movement', 'optogenetics', 'predictive test', 'rapid eye movement', 'relating to nervous system', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep regulation', 'spatial memory', 'targeted treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tool', 'virtual environment', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment', 'way finding']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,622966
"Unraveling the neural basis of female aggression and dementia-related aggression: a systems biology approach. Project Summary Males and females elicit aggressive behavior for resources and survival. Male aggression has been well studied in many species. However, not much is known about female aggression. Recently, my work identified a small female- specific subgroup of cells in the pC1 brain region (pC1α neurons), that triggered females to fight at extremely high intensity levels when activated. For the K99 phase, I will build on my previous work and elaborate on the pC1α neurons circuitry under the mentorship of Dr. E. Kravitz, a well-renowned expert in aggression and Drosophila genetics. Aim 1 is concerned with determining the pre- and post-synaptic partners of the pC1α neurons. For this aim, I will work with my co-mentor, Dr. R. Wilson, to determine pre- and post- synaptic partners and design transgenic fly lines to target these areas. Based on my preliminary data of electron microscopy tracings, I hypothesize that, a)SAG neurons provide inputs to pC1α neurons; and b) pC1α neurons project dendritic outputs to PVL04om_pct neurons in areas previously identified in aggression such as Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum. I anticipate that both up- and down-stream pC1α neurons partners will induce high intensity female aggression. Aim 2 will investigate the role of candidate aggression-associated genes in pC1α neurons. I will train in single-cell profiling methods (used by the Kravitz lab) and address the hypothesis that genes overexpressed in male aggression mediating neurons also play key role in pC1α neuron function. In collaboration with co-mentor Dr. B de Bivort, I will also use neural network-based body part tracking software to train a classifier to automatically label aggressive behaviors. This will allow me to use machine-learning algorithms to capture multi-dimensional representations of the phenotypic differences among fly lines with mutations and transgenic effectors that target aggression circuits (e.g, activating and inhibiting a neuron or overexpressing aggregating proteins). The trainings acquired in my mentored K99 phase will facilitate my transition to independent research studying age-related diseases and behavior. Severe behavioral disturbances of aggression and agitation have been reported to be increasingly common during the progression of Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias.The reasons for this are completely unknown. Moreover, there is a dearth of understanding of how changes in neurons, during neurodegeneration, lead to specific behavioral defects. For the R00 phase, I will shift my focus to looking at aggression in neurodegenerative disease models and begin my efforts by elucidating the contribution of neuronal protein aggregates of Aβ-42 to aggression. My preliminary data indicates that overexpression of human Aβ-42 in using a (pan-neuronal driver) in males and (cholinergic driver) in females induces heightend levels of aggression. Based on these findings, I hypothesize Aβ-42 overexpression induced aggression is due to altered excitability of key aggression promoting neurons. I plan to use diverse and integrative systems approaches (learned from my mentored phase). I will lead a multi-pronged research effort to understand the mechanisms by which neurons regulate their normal function in the presence of an aging and or neurodegenerative disease state and how these changes affect circuit pathways and ultimately aggression. Project Narrative Aggression accompanies a number of common human neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's and other related dementias), with little understanding of how cognitive and aggression symptoms may be linked at the neuronal level. Aggression has been extensively studied in males of many species, but neglected in females (likewise, the interaction of sex and age is neglected). The objective of this research program is to identify the neural circuitry that governs female aggression (K99- mentored phase) and later transition (R00- independent phase) into discovering mechanisms of dementia-related pathology and how these changes affect aggression.",Unraveling the neural basis of female aggression and dementia-related aggression: a systems biology approach.,10192224,K99GM141449,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Body part', 'Brain region', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cells', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Female', 'Ganglia', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Human', 'Instinct', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'PC3 cell line', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical aggression', 'Play', 'Population', 'RNA Interference', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Senile Plaques', 'Social Behavior', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'bullying', 'cholinergic', 'cholinergic neuron', 'common symptom', 'connectome', 'design', 'extracellular', 'fighting', 'fly', 'genetic manipulation', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuronal excitability', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein aggregation', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sex', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K99,2021,100000
"Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution Project Summary The dynamic adaptability of the mammalian brain to environmental changes is remarkable, as it is the complexity of the networks of neurons underlying the operations that allow for such adaptations. Although we have some understanding of the anatomical and functional basis of this, we are still lacking a detailed picture of how the modulation of neuronal activity works. What is the timing and locations of these neuromodulator release and relationship with excitatory/inhibitory circuits? How does the neuromodulators circuitry accomplish the regulation of firing and synaptic properties of targeted neurons? Filling these gaps in knowledge would advance our understanding of all aspects of neuromodulator biology and allow discovery of new therapeutic strategies. To help close this gap, we have used creative approaches to the development of genetically encoded to directly report behaviorally triggered and modulated neuromodulator release including serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE). We have disseminated these indicators to the neuroscience community and spurred major discoveries of novel mechanisms regulating neuromodulator release underlying motivation and addiction. Build on this initial success, we propose to further expand the effectiveness of this toolbox of NM sensors to enable imaging sparse release at depth and subcellular resolution. Our specific goals are to (1) improve the sensitivity of our current sensors to enable robust imaging of sparse neuromodulator release, push their spatial resolution to the subcellular level and increase linearity of response at lower concentrations; (2) expand their spectral range to red/far-red to enhance imaging depth, SNR and in vivo multiplex measurement and manipulation of multiple circuit components using two or three distinct colors, and (3) characterize the possible interference of current sensors with endogenous signaling and systematically validate emerging sensors with a wide-ranging microscopy approaches in vivo. Our strategy relies on a dynamic collaboration between the sensor design team and end users to obtain continuous feedback to implement efficient improvements to the sensors. It is our goal to rapidly disseminate a wide range of well-characterized, highly sensitive indicators for the neuroscience community to be employed to study behaving mice, fish, flies and worms, to enrich our knowledge on the functional roles of neuromodulators in the brain circuitry. Altered neurotransmitter and neuromodulator (NM) signaling is a key feature of virtually all human neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, depression, and addiction. We will engineer, validate and disseminate optimized genetically encoded sensors for visualizing neuronal communication with enhanced depth and resolution using advanced microscopy techniques. Combined with optogenetics and calcium/voltage imaging, applications of these tools will reveal the full richness of neuromodulatory signaling to greatly extend, and potentially transform, our understanding of how neurochemical inputs influence cell and circuit function in health and disease.",Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution,10166304,U01NS120820,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Effectiveness', 'Endorphins', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Fishes', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Opsin', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Penetration', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photometry', 'Photons', 'Property', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serotonin', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cell type', 'design', 'environmental change', 'extracellular', 'fly', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'minimally invasive', 'monoamine', 'multiplexed imaging', 'nerve supply', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U01,2021,869559
"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease. This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning. We will find the exact areas of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum that participate in this learning, and use machine learning techniques to understand how the activity of neurons recorded simultaneously in these brain areas can facilitate learning.",The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning,10150927,R01NS113078,"['Affect', 'Agonist', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar Cortex', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fractals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Reaction Time', 'Reading', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Work', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'human disease', 'kinematics', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'success', 'visual learning', 'visual motor']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,1026631
"Neuron- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms and Adaptations Regulating Motor Function in Parkinson Disease Models ABSTRACT  Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease (after Alzheimer's disease), afflicting tens of millions worldwide. The characteristic disease symptoms arise from basal ganglia dysfunction that occurs secondary to loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Symptomatic treatment is focused either on replacing dopamine or disrupting aberrant activity through deep- brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus or the primary basal ganglia output nucleus in the primate, internal globus pallidus (GPi). This proposal is aimed at understanding the function and dysfunction of basal ganglia circuitry in mice, at the output of the basal ganglia to motor thalamus. In Aim 1, we will develop strategies to identify basal ganglia-recipient motor thalamus neurons in ventral anterior/ventral lateral thalamus (VA/VL), and characterize their projection targets and cortical inputs in awake, behaving animals. In Aim 2, we will use sophisticated in vivo strategies to record from posterior EP neurons and VA/VL neurons as animals move their limbs during locomotion, a fixed repetitive behavior. We will perturb activity in this pathway using optogenetics to determine the contribution of activity in these neurons to forelimb movements, and we will examine how activity in this pathway is altered after loss of striatal dopamine. In Aim 3, we will perform similar experiments in mice performing a lever-pulling task, a flexible forelimb movement. We will examine both cued and uncued versions of this task to distinguish activity generated internally vs. externally. Finally, we will examine how loss of striatal dopamine impacts EP and VA/VL activity during flexible forelimb movements. Our overarching goal is to understand how loss of striatal dopamine in PD leads to disruptions in basal ganglia circuit function and motor deficits, in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies for treating PD motor symptoms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Parkinson's disease (PD) results from a progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the midbrain, most of which innervate the basal ganglia. Here, we propose to study the effects of dopamine loss in mice, focusing on the function of the entopeduncular nucleus (a rodent equivalent of the internal globus pallidus, major output nucleus of the basal ganglia, and a site of deep brain stimulation in PD) and the ventral motor thalamus. Remarkably, the function of these regions remains mysterious, yet they hold great promise for understanding PD and developing new therapeutic strategies for treating PD symptoms.",Neuron- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms and Adaptations Regulating Motor Function in Parkinson Disease Models,10093142,R01NS064984,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Axon', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain Stem', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Characteristics', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dopamine', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Eye Movements', 'Forelimb', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homologous Gene', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Locomotion', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Secondary to', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'Subthalamic structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'awake', 'base', 'body position', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'density', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'endopeduncular nucleus', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'motor symptom', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'optogenetics', 'parkinsonian rodent', 'pars compacta', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'symptom treatment', 'tool']",NINDS,J.

"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We will define mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, and organization of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane of developing neurons, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal cell shape.",Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons,10159320,R01NS112326,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Clathrin', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Distal', 'Endocytosis', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exocytosis', 'Extracellular Space', 'Frequencies', 'Growth Cones', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'PHluorin', 'PTK2 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphorylation', 'Population', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Regulation of Exocytosis', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'SNAP receptor', 'Side', 'Stretching', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus', 'Time', 'Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'axon guidance', 'cell behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical model', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'synaptogenesis', 'vesicular SNARE proteins']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,384007
"Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Project Summary: Considerable evidence exists to support the notion that amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology impair neuronal circuit integrity and function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Unfortunately, few studies have tested the direct influence of AD pathology on spatial computation within affected neuronal populations, resulting in an information gap at the neuronal network level. Moreover, in vivo experiments that examine large scale, neuronal network activity in mouse models of Aβ and tau pathology are lacking. In this proposal, I test the overarching hypothesis that Aβ and tau associated neuronal network dysfunction impairs task-relevant, spatial information encoding in large populations of neurons within the EC-HIPP circuit, and that combating this aberrant activity can restore order and improve spatial information processing in AD mice. In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that oligomeric forms of Aβ and tau disturb spatial information content encoded within large populations of neurons in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit. I will also test if these oligomeric peptides alter the number of neurons recruited into the population code responsible for memory encoding in a spatial learning and memory task. In Aims 2 & 3, I will leverage the predictive power of machine learning to decipher the neural code for spatial information processing in EC-HIPP population activity. Specifically, my goals in Aim 2 will be to examine the individual and combined impact of Aβ and tau pathologies on features of spatial information encoding in the EC-Tau/hAPP mouse line. In Aim 3, I will employ chemogenetics using a novel DREADDs ligand to combat aberrant neuronal activity in AD mouse models, with the ultimate goal of improving spatial information processing in neuronal networks burdened with pathology. Excitatory neurons will be specifically targeted in an effort to better understand their contribution to impaired spatial information processing in AD mouse models.  The proposed research aims are designed to bridge an information gap between AD-related cognitive impairment and the underlying circuit pathology. This Mentored Research Scientist Development (K01) Award will afford me the opportunity to accomplish this major goal while enriching my technical skillset and expanding my knowledge of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the integrated training and mentorship that I will receive will help me develop additional expertise in machine learning for spatial decoding analyses. Together, the proposed studies and career development plan will ensure that I achieve my long-term career goal of launching a competitive, independent research career at a major research university. Project Narrative The progressive accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with dysfunctional neuronal signaling and poor cognitive performance. In this proposal, newly developed machine learning strategies will be used to decode features of task-relevant, spatial information from neural ensemble activity in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit of transgenic mice expressing Aβ and tau pathology, with the overarching goal of understanding how Aβ and tau interfere with spatial information encoded within neuronal networks. Dysfunctional neuronal populations will then be selectively targeted using chemogenetics to correct their aberrant firing patterns, with the aim of improving the quality of spatial information carried by pathology afflicted neuronal networks.",Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice,10237353,K01AG068598,"['4-Hydroxy-Tamoxifen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'J20 mouse', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Universities', 'abeta accumulation', 'attenuation', 'awake', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive performance', 'combat', 'design', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'entorhinal cortex', 'excitatory neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'learning strategy', 'memory encoding', 'mouse model', 'network dysfunction', 'neuron loss', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatial memory', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2021,106388
