"Computational Analysis of Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation Project Summary: It is of great fundamental and biomedical importance to understand the physical princi- ples that govern the coupling between the chemical step in a biomolecule and other events, such as penetration of water molecules into the active site, recruitment of transient metal ions, or conformational rearrangements near and afar. This is a challenging task, however, due to the intrinsic multi-scale nature of the problem. As a result, our understanding in factors that dictate the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of enzyme catalysis remains in- complete, especially regarding contributions beyond the active site; this knowledge gap has greatly limited our ability to design highly efﬁcient enzymes de novo. Motivated by these considerations, the overarching theme of our research is to develop and apply multi-scale computational methods to reveal the underlying mechanism of enzyme catalysis at an atomic level, with a particular emphasis on establishing to what degree the chem- ical step is coupled with other processes proximal or distal to the active site. Speciﬁcally, we aim to develop an efﬁcient QM/MM framework to compute free energy proﬁles of enzyme reactions with a good balance of computational speed and accuracy; further integration with enhanced sampling approaches, machine learning techniques and modern computational hardwares enables us to gain insights into the nature of coupling be- tween the chemical step and other events during the functional cycle. Accordingly, we are in a unique position to pursue several lines of exciting applications, which include the mechanism and impact of transient metal ion recruiting in nucleic acid processing enzymes, the catalytic and regulatory mechanism of peripheral membrane enzymes, and systemic analysis of allosteric coupling in a transcription factor; an emerging research direction is to explore the interplay of stability, catalytic activity, and allostery during continuous directed evolution. Our project integrates computational method developments with applications inspired by recent experimental ad- vances, such as time-resolved crystallography, deep mutational scanning and continuous directed evolution. The research efforts will lead to novel computational tools and mechanistic insights into the regulatory mech- anisms of enzymes by processes either near or remote from the active site. Thus the project will have both fundamental impacts and implications for better design strategies for catalysis and allostery in biomolecules. Narrative: The computational methodologies we develop will be applicable to a broad set of metalloen- zymes and proteins of biomedical relevance. In particular, we target fundamental mechanistic problems in enzymes that catalyze nucleic acids synthesis/modiﬁcation and lipid metabolism, since mutations in these en- zymes are implicated in numerous human diseases such as cancer, insulin resistance and diabetes. Although our project does not focus on design of drugs, the mechanistic insights into enzyme catalysis and allosteric regulation will broaden strategies that can be used to target various enzymes of biomedical signiﬁcance.",Computational Analysis of Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation,10206585,R35GM141930,"['Active Sites', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Crystallography', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Membrane', 'Metals', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Penetration', 'Peripheral', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tweens', 'Water', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'enzyme mechanism', 'human disease', 'insight', 'lipid metabolism', 'method development', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'recruit', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R35,2021,295591
"Spatiotemporal control of concentration gradients with electrochemistry in extracelluar space Project Summary  The natural environment is intrinsically spatiotemporally heterogenous at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. What shapes such a heterogeneity includes the concentration gradients of biologically relevant chemical species in the extracellular medium including dioxygen (O2), reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as essential redox-active transition metals. While a significant amount of effort has been devoted to spectroscopically image these chemical moieties, our capability to spatiotemporally control their concentration distributions in the extracellular medium remains limited. This is especially the case for biofilms and microbiota, in which the microorganisms’ small length scales pose significant challenges for concentration modulation. The inadequate control of concentration heterogeneity limits our capability of mimicking the natural environments in vitro and investigating how local concentration gradients affect microbial functionality. Therefore, there is a need for an advanced method of controlling chemical concentrations at microscopic level.  Our proposed research aims to use electrochemical nano-/micro-electrodes to spatiotemporally control the concentration gradients in the extracellular medium. When an electrochemical reaction occurs on an electrode’s surface, a concentration gradient is established near the electrode. Taking advantages of this phenomena with the assistance of numerical simulation, we will employ an array of nano-/micro-electrodes with individually addressable electrochemical potentials to program any arbitrary spatiotemporal concentration profiles. We will fine-tune the surface chemistry and the electrochemical properties of these electrodes to ensure biocompatibility and reaction specificity. The developed system will be applied to biofilms and we aim to investigate how the microbial social behavior will be affected by a perturbation of local O2 concentration. Moreover, we will use this device to mimic the heterogenous environment in the gut and culture gut microbiota in vitro. An algorithm based on machine learning will be employed to actively adjust electrode potentials, maintaining a stable concentration profile despite the accumulation of gut microorganisms.  Ultimately, our work will expand our capability of controlling the concentration heterogeneity in nature. The developed electrochemical system will serve an in vitro platform to culture microorganisms in their native environment, or as a tool to perturb the concentration profiles. Combining electrochemistry, inorganic chemistry, and nanomaterials the research will enable a deeper understanding of the spatial distribution and temporal response of microbial systems. Project Narrative The natural environment is intrinsically heterogenous yet our control of concentrations for chemical species is limited at microscopic level. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of the NIH because it describes the development of technology that will expand our capability of controlling chemical concentration profiles in a variety of microbial systems relevant to the public health. The research described here will enable a deeper understanding of disease-related microbial systems and help to formulate strategies to combat diseases.",Spatiotemporal control of concentration gradients with electrochemistry in extracelluar space,10256801,R35GM138241,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Devices', 'Dioxygen', 'Disease', 'Electrochemistry', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Heterogeneity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Chemistry', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Nanoarray Analytical Device', 'Nature', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'System', 'Transition Elements', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'combat', 'extracellular', 'gut microbiota', 'microbial', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'microorganism culture', 'nano', 'nanomaterials', 'programs', 'response', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'technology development', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R35,2021,371084
"Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core OVERALL SUMMARY The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease. By comparison to near-comprehensive genetic information, comparatively little is understood of the totality of the human metabolome, largely due to insufficiencies in molecular identification methods. Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements. OVERALL NARRATIVE This project will utilize integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational computational approaches coupled with advanced instrumentation to characterize the human metabolome, and identify currently unidentifiable molecules without the use of authentic chemical standards. Results from these studies will contribute to the goal of understanding diseases, and the tools and resources will be made publically available for biomedical researchers.",Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core,10213202,U2CES030170,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Attributes of Chemicals', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Isotopes', 'Libraries', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Phase', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemical property', 'chemical standard', 'comparative', 'computational chemistry', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'dark matter', 'dietary', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'ion mobility', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'quantum chemistry', 'small molecule libraries', 'stereochemistry', 'tool']",NIEHS,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U2C,2021,981634
"Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We have recently developed novel framework for next-generation quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) designed to meet the challenges of biomolecular simulations and drug discovery applications. QMFFs have tremendous computational advantages relative to their fully QM counterparts, being inherently parallelizable and linearly scaling, offering tremendous computational speedup, and promising quantitative accuracy potentially superior to full QM methods. QMFFs accurately model multipolar electrostatics, charge penetration effects, and non-linear polarization response. QMFFs thus offer a transformative technology for drug discovery applications, in particular, for advancing the predictive capability of free energy simulations in lead reﬁnement. These are critically important for the diverse chemical space of drug molecules, including halogen bonding, cation-  and metal-ligand interactions. Further, QMFFs offer a mechanism for modeling covalent inhibitors. Speciﬁcally, we propose to: I. Develop new QMFFs for drug discovery. QMFFs will be developed based on both semiempirical and ab initio density-functional methods in the following stages: 1) determination of multipolar mapping parameters enhancing the DFTB electrostatic potential to reach greater accuracy, 2) augmentation of electronic response terms using chemical potential equalization (CPE) corrections using an orthogonal perturbation-response approach to solve the under-polarization problem of DFTB methods, 3) parameterization of non-electrostatic non-bonded interac- tion parameters using realistic potentials that capture many-body exchange and dispersion interactions, and 4) exploration of statistical potentials, using machine learning approaches applied to quantum data sets, to correct internal conformational energies and short-range interactions. II. Develop new free energy methods to enable protein-ligand binding predictions using QMFFs. We will develop a novel integrated free energy pipeline to pre- dict alchemical binding free energies for ligands and inhibitors. This will include new GPU-accelerated methods for  -space self-adaptive mixture sampling ( -SAMS) and 2D-vFEP analysis, coupled with conformational space enhanced sampling methods for alchemical steps of the thermodynamic cycle, and advancements in free en- ergy “book-ending” methods (BBQm) to efﬁciently connect molecular mechanical force ﬁeld and QMFF model representations. III. Test and validate QMFFs and free energy methods, and apply to MIF inhibitor binding. The methods will be broadly tested against established data sets for solvation free energies, and a drug discovery data set. More in-depth validation studies will be conducted by examining the relative binding free energies of inhibitors of the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF). Finally, exploratory applications will examine mechanisms, characterize transition states and predict rates for covalent inhibition for a series of MIF inhibitors. Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Laboratory for Biomolecular Simulation Research, Rutgers University, Piscat- away, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We propose a novel strategy to develop a class of integrated quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) that create highly accurate physical models for complex biomolecular simulations. Com- bined with recently developed high-precision free energy simulation and analysis tools, the pro- posed QMFFs will overcome current critical barriers to progress for drug discovery and deliver accurate and precise predictions for drug binding afﬁnity to enhance lead optimization. The pro- posed work will be applied to understand ligand-protein binding in the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF), and provide insight that may guide the design of new non-covalent and targeted covalent inhibitors to MIF and other systems.",Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications,10202634,R01GM107485,"['Affinity', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Books', 'Cations', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Free Energy', 'Halogens', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Penetration', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lead optimization', 'macrophage', 'mechanical force', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'programs', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2021,322545
"Non-target analysis of maternal and cord blood samples: Advancing computational tools and discovering novel chemicals PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Non-targeted analysis (NTA) provides a comprehensive approach to analyze environmental and biological samples for nearly all chemicals present. Despite the recent advancements in NTA, the number of confirmed chemicals with analytical standards remains fairly small compared to the number of detected features. There is, thus, a need to further develop computational tools to derive more chemical structures and leverage the full potential of HRMS. Enhancing our ability to derive more chemical structures will enable the discovery of new industrial chemicals that humans are exposed to, especially in critical windows of development, such as pregnancy. It will also enable the discovery of endogenously produced metabolites that may be related to biological outcomes of importance, such as preterm birth. The objective of my proposal is to develop novel computational methods to significantly advance our ability to analyze and interpret non-targeted analysis data from high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and apply them to study prenatal exposures to industrial chemicals and endogenous metabolites in a large cohort of pregnant women from Northern California. My proposal builds on my expertise in analytical and environmental chemistry and my current postdoctoral experience in computational chemistry and applications in human exposure. I seek additional training to develop and apply innovative computational methods to better characterize the human exposome and in particular the exposome of preterm birth. The contribution of my proposal will be two-fold: (1) developing novel computational structure-prediction algorithms for HRMS datasets based on MS data and physicochemical properties (equilibrium partition ratios between organic solvents and water, e.g., octanol/water, chlorobenzene/water, diethyl ether/water etc.) (Aim 1) and apply them to derive potential structures for chemical features detected in a HRMS dataset from 340 maternal and 340 matched cord blood samples to complement the limited number of chemicals identified through MS/MS and analytical standards (Aim 2); and (2) study the interplay between the exposome and the metabolome in preterm birth using molecular interaction networks to visualize and compare how molecular interactions between industrial chemicals and endogenous metabolites differ between preterm and full-term birth (Aim 3). The K99 training will expand my prior research experience through coursework, research apprenticeship, and mentored reading, with specific training in: (1) advanced analytical skills including -omics data analysis, machine learning, and biostatistics; (2) epidemiology, risk assessment, human exposure to chemical stressors; and (3) human pregnancy and development. The skills acquired during this award are critical to my long-term goal to advance computational methods to better analyze and interpret non-targeted analysis data to support efforts to better characterize the human exposome. This work will produce new scientific knowledge to greatly advance the understanding of the influence of environmental exposures in the development of adverse health outcomes and in particular, preterm birth. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) offer unique opportunities to study the human exposome and the development of adverse health outcomes. Despite advances in non-targeted analysis, the number of confirmed chemicals remains fairly limited compared to the number of detected chemical features.

"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE A quantitative model of blood homeostasis based on predicting the normal levels of small molecules in the blood can help identify diseases or other stresses that cause changes to those levels. The proposed statistical methods that will be used to develop this homeostasis model have the potential to efficiently identify more reliable disease markers and to more accurately predict disease risk.",Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites,10159296,R01GM131491,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gases', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Glucose', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data quality', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'lipidomics', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'predictive modeling', 'risk prediction', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,376064

(3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE A quantitative model of blood homeostasis based on predicting the normal levels of small molecules in the blood can help identify diseases or other stresses that cause changes to those levels. The proposed statistical methods that will be used to develop this homeostasis model have the potential to efficiently identify more reliable disease markers and to more accurately predict disease risk.",Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites,10372262,R01GM131491,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gases', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Glucose', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data quality', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'lipidomics', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'predictive modeling', 'risk prediction', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,431464
"Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The study of biomolecular interactions and design of new therapeutics requires accurate physical models of the atomistic interactions between small molecules and biological macromolecules. Over the least few decades, molecular mechanics force ﬁelds have demonstrated the potential that physical models hold for quantitative biophysical modeling and predictive molecular design. However, a signiﬁcant technology gap exists in our ability to build force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy, can be systematically improved in a statistically robust manner, be extended to new areas of chemistry, can model post-translational and covalent modiﬁcations, are able to quantify systematic errors in predictions, and can be broadly applied across a high-performance software packages. In this project, we aim to bridge this technology gap to enable new generations of accurate quantitative biomolec- ular modeling and (bio)molecular design for chemical biology and drug discovery. In Aim 1, we will produce a modern, open infrastructure to enable practitioners to rapidly and conveniently construct and employ accurate and statistically robust physical force ﬁelds via automated machine learning methods. In Aim 2, we will construct open, machine-readable experimental and quantum chemical datasets that will accelerate next-generation force ﬁeld development. In Aim 3, we will develop statistically robust Bayesian inference techniques to enable the auto- mated construction of type assignment schemes that avoid overﬁtting and selection of physical functional forms statistically justﬁed by the data. This approach will also provide an estimate of the systematic error in predicted properties arising from uncertainty in parameters or functional form choices—generally the dominant source of error—to be quantiﬁed with little added expense. In Aim 4, we will integrate and apply this infrastructure to produce open, transferable, self-consistent force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy and broad coverage for modeling small molecule interactions with biomolecules (including unnatural amino or nucleic acids and covalent modiﬁcations by organic molecules), with the ultimate goal of covering all major biomolecules. This research is signiﬁcant in that the technology developed in this project has the potential to radically transform the study of biomolecular phenomena by providing highly accurate force ﬁelds with exceptionally broad chemical coverage via fully consistent parameterization of organic (bio)molecules. In addition, we will produce new tools to automate force ﬁeld creation and tailoring to speciﬁc problem domains, quantify the systematic error in predictions, and identify new data for improving force ﬁeld accuracy. This will greatly improve our ability to study diverse biophysical processes at the molecular level, and to rationally design new small-molecule, protein, and nucleic acid therapeutics. This approach will bring statistical rigor to the ﬁeld of force ﬁeld construction and application by providing a means to make data-driven decisions, while enhancing reproducibility by enabling it to become a rigorous and reproducible science using a fully open infrastructure and datasets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scientists use computer simulations of proteins, DNA, and RNA, at atomic detail, to learn how these molecules of life do their jobs. They also use simulations to help design new medications – compounds that can bind and inﬂuence the behavior of these molecules of life, and thereby block diseases at the molecular level. We aim to greatly increase the utility of all of these simulations by improving the accuracy of the formulas they use to compute the forces acting between atoms.",Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design,10105344,R01GM132386,"['Address', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Electrostatics', 'Ensure', 'Error Sources', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Occupations', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic', 'Thermodynamics', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biophysical model', 'chemical synthesis', 'cheminformatics', 'data infrastructure', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'macromolecule', 'models and simulation', 'molecular mechanics', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'nucleic acid-based therapeutics', 'open data', 'open source', 'physical model', 'physical property', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'small molecule', 'software infrastructure', 'sound', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2021,608856
"Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of mammary gland exposure-response relationships to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) Project Abstract  Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of over 5000 man-made chemicals that are ubiquitous in the environment, due to their chemical stability and bioaccumulative properties. Many of these “forever chemicals” have been linked with health concerns, including strong evidence of developmental health and harm to hormone-sensitive tissues. Manufacturers continue to substitute new PFAS for which exposure- based health risks are unknown. There is an urgent public health need to determine the effects of PFAS in use on both mammary gland development and increased breast cancer incidence. Current exposure studies use rodent models that require cumbersome end-point analyses as well as large monetary and time investments.  Our proposal is aimed at developing an in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) pipeline of mammary gland development and maintenance to identify and prioritize potentially toxic PFAS, to ultimately mitigate number of animals needed for environmental exposure studies. Our approach is to develop in vitro models of the mammary gland of increasing complexity but decreasing throughput, identifying links between high-throughput and high- complexity model endpoint readouts to best prioritize large chemical libraries. A key technology to establish links across multiple in vitro culture platforms is optical coherence tomography-based structural-functional imaging (OCT-SFI), developed by MPI Oldenburg, which non-invasively visualizes label-free cells, their intracellular motility, and morphology of formed spheroids, within optically turbid tissue models.  Our first specific aim advances a high-throughput paper-based culture system, developed by MPI Lockett, to study mammary epithelial cell invasion in physiologically relevant tissue microenvironments. The platform will evaluate 96 different exposure conditions in parallel. Our second specific aim employs 3D co-culture models that include fibroblasts to model stromal signaling known to affect mammary gland development. OCT-SFI will provide cellular motility and morphology of the organotypic spheroids that form in these cultures. Finally, our third aim will screen a library of 40 PFAS, with a particular focus on the perfluoroethercarboxylic acids (PFECAs) currently used in industrial coatings. In addition, 12 PFAS will be screened for which there is existing in vivo rodent model data available, and comparisons between in vitro assay outputs and in vivo gland remodeling will be used to refine the assay models and establish initial thresholds for screening.  The models developed as part of this proposal will thus be predictive of biology, enabling the high-throughput capability needed for future screening of all PFAS as well as other emerging endocrine disruptors. The project’s risk is balanced by the known imaging capabilities of OCT-SFI to probe responses in 3D spheroid and paper- based co-cultures. The high-throughput nature of this IVIVE pipeline makes it ideal for screening libraries of potential toxicants, providing information-rich datasets of spatially and temporally resolved morphological and molecular changes across the tissue-like structures. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a pipeline to screen and prioritize libraries of potentially toxic man-made chemicals found in the environment for further analyses, with particular emphasis on per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) of which there are over 5000 currently known. Current environmental exposure testing methods evaluate mammary gland development in live mice because the mammary gland is highly susceptible to chemical exposure; yet, such methods are slow and expensive. Our proposal uses mammary cell culture models in increasingly complex, tissue-like environments, in combination with high-speed 3D optical imaging techniques, and ultimately compare the platform with a few candidate PFAS against existing data in live mice, setting the stage for future high-throughput screening of potential environmental toxicants.",Developing an in vitro to in vivo pipeline of mammary gland exposure-response relationships to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),10271405,R01ES032730,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Breast Cancer Epidemiology', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Fibroblasts', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gland', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hormones', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Investments', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary gland', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Mesenchymal', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nature', 'North Carolina', 'Odds Ratio', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Physiological', 'Poly-fluoroalkyl substances', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Scanning', 'Scoring Method', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'assay development', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'carcinogenicity', 'cell motility', 'chemical stability', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging capabilities', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'intercellular communication', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant phenotype', 'mammary epithelium', 'mammary gland development', 'man', 'model design', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'premalignant', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,499609
"Enabling the Accelerated Discovery of Novel Chemical Probes by Integration of Crystallographic, Computational, and Synthetic Chemistry Approaches ABSTRACT Identification of high-quality chemical probes, molecules with high specificity and selectivity against macromolecules, is of critical interest to drug discovery. Although millions of compounds have been screened against thousands of protein targets, small-molecule probes are currently available for only 4% of the human proteome. Thus, more efficient approaches are required to accelerate the development of novel, target-specific probes. In 2019, a new bold initiative called “Target 2035” was launched with the goal of “creating […] chemical probes, and/or functional antibodies for the entire proteome” by 2035. In support of this ambitious initiative, we propose to develop and test a novel integrative AI-driven methodology for rapid chemical probe discovery against any target protein. Here, we will build an integrative workflow where the unique XChem database of experimental crystallographic information describing the pose and nature of chemical fragments binding to the target protein will be used in several innovative computational approaches to predict the structure of organic molecules with high affinity towards specific targets. The candidate molecules will be experimentally validated and then optimized, using computational algorithms, into lead molecules to seed chemical probe development. The proposed project is structured around three following interrelated keystones: (i) Develop a novel method for ligand-binding hot-spot identification and discovery of novel chemical probe candidates; (ii) Develop novel fragment-based integrative computational approach for accelerated de novo design of chemical probes; (iii) Consensus prediction of target-specific ligands, synthesis, and experimental validation of computational hits.  More specifically, we will develop a hybrid method to predict structures of high-affinity ligands for proteins for which XChem fragment screens have been completed. These approaches will be used for screening of ultra- large (>10 billion) chemical libraries to identify putative high affinity ligands within crystallographically determined pockets. Then, we will develop and employ an approach using graph convolutional neural networks for de novo design of a library of strong binders that will be evaluated to select the best candidates for chemical optimization. Finally, we will combine traditional structure-based and novel approaches, developed in this project to select consensus hit compounds against three target proteins: transcription factor brachyury, hydrolase NUDT5, and bromodomain BAZ2B. Iterative design guided by the computational algorithms, synthesis, and testing will progressively optimize molecules to micromolar leads to chemical probes for the target proteins.  Completion of the proposed aims will deliver a robust integrative workflow to identify leads for chemical probes against diverse target proteins. We expect that our AI-based computational approach to convert crystallographically-determined chemical fragments into lead compounds coupled with the experimental validation of computational algorithms will accelerate the discovery of new chemical probes, expand the druggable proteome, and support future drug discovery studies PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is devoted to the development of a novel integrative, structure-based, artificial intelligence driven methodology for rapid chemical probe discovery against any target protein.

"Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a suite of software modules to enable scientists to unambiguously represent chemical mixtures in standard machine-readable formats, filling an urgent and widely-recognized need. Chemicals are typically formulated as mixtures. Recording and communicating infor- mation about chemical mixtures is essential for scientists and support staff in the pharmaceutical industry, in academia, in non-profit research organizations, in government, at specialty chemical vendors, and at commer- cial manufacturers to: • discover, develop, formulate, manufacture and regulate drugs; • manage reagent inventories; comply with laboratory safety requirements; inform first responders; • describe and reproduce biomedical experiments; and • assess and disseminate information about toxicity risks of chemical reagents and consumer products.  A working committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is close to for- malizing “Mixtures InChI” (or MInChI), which will extend the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) to be- come the first standard to encompass mixtures. MInChI will effectively index mixtures in the same way that InChI indexes individual compounds.  In Phase 1 CDD developed the data structures and software necessary to enable adoption and utilization of MInChI and create the first general-purpose system for recording information about chemical mixtures that is computable and interoperable. In Phase 2 CDD will continue to develop a sophisticated automated transla- tion tool that will accurately convert legacy catalogs of chemical mixtures from plaintext descriptions or ad hoc formats so that they are properly represented in a machine readable format that can in turn be easily rendered into MInChI identifiers. The broad vision is to help industry to overcome the barriers to adoption so that ma- chine readable mixture descriptions can quickly deliver benefits for drug discovery, chemical safety, and toxi- cology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accu- rately document the composition of chemical mixtures in a format that computers can easily interpret, process, and exchange. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. It will also help to advance our understanding of the toxicol- ogy of mixtures (which often differs from the toxicology of individual components) and improve laboratory safety both in industry and in educational settings. !",Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation,10074602,R44TR002528,"['Academia', 'Adoption', 'Ally', 'Books', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Commercial Catalogs', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shorthand', 'Solvents', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Traction', 'Translations', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'first responder', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'male', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'quality assurance', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2021,750747
"A novel technology to assess chronic toxicity in genetically diverse nematode populations Project Abstract The number of new products such as drugs, cosmetics and food additives introduced into the market is growing and poses a significant challenge for risk prediction. Currently, vertebrate testing is the industry standard for hazard assessment but has limitations including high costs, and the growing public and corporate sentiment against using vertebrates for chemical testing. Importantly, current toxicity assessment does not incorporate genetic diversity leading to failure of drug candidates and unintended risks to human sub-populations. The celebrated invertebrate model C. elegans has the potential to fill this gap since thousands of genetically diverse nematode populations are available. However, the main challenge is that chronic studies of chemicals in the nematode model is still tedious, precluding large-scale toxicity testing in nematode populations. This proposal aims to develop a high-throughput technology for chronic toxicity screening of diverse genetic populations in adult C. elegans. The focus of our Phase I plan is to pursue chronic toxicity studies on select toxins and generate foundational data highlighting the impact of genetic diversity, and subsequently scale the NemaLife technology to enable large-scale genetic diversity screening. AIM 1: To generate chronic dose-response data on toxins affecting diverse C. elegans strains. We will test the effects of five toxins for which we know the variability in human and rodent responses. Animals will be exposed to toxins daily, followed by scoring of survival, reproductive and neuromuscular health. About 1200 whole-life assays will be conducted with data acquired on 500+ animals per assay condition. We will generate data that will define the rank-order of C. elegans toxin response vis-à-vis mammalian systems, optimize phenotyping conditions for large numbers of strains per species, and define the amount of heritable variation in toxin responses. These pilot data will validate the capabilities afforded by our screening platform. AIM 2: To scale the throughput of NemaLife Technology for thousands of chronic toxicity assays. Currently, NemaLife’s technology has a throughput of hundreds of chronic toxicity assays. However, given the large number of toxins and vast library of genetic strains and wild isolates available, there is a significant need to increase the throughput of our technology. Therefore, we will develop the technology infrastructure and workflow to scale the throughput which includes multiplexing our approach, scale-up of chip fabrication and streamlining data analysis. Technology development at the scale of thousands of whole-life toxicity assays in a few weeks with readouts on animal death and neuromuscular impairments will be a major breakthrough in the field opening up new business opportunities in toxicity testing in the drug and consumer industry. Project Narrative Non-parasitic nematodes offer a powerful in vivo model to scale and measure toxin responses in genetically diverse species anchoring a transformative means to bridge current gaps in predictive toxicology with clinically-relevant end points. Our study aims to combine state-of-the art advances in microfluidics, computer vision, laboratory automation and a massively curated genetically diverse nematode species to produce a new screening approach capable of testing thousands of chemicals relevant to agriculture, nutraceutical and biotech markets.",A novel technology to assess chronic toxicity in genetically diverse nematode populations,10112054,R43ES032516,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Agriculture', 'Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Automation', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Businesses', 'Cadmium', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cosmetics', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Food Additives', 'Foundations', 'Gait', 'Gene Library', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Hazard Assessment', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Industry', 'Industry Standard', 'Infrastructure', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Liquid substance', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Metformin', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nematoda', 'Nutraceutical', 'Paraquat', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Safety', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Toxicology', 'Toxin', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug candidate', 'genetic resource', 'genetic strain', 'high throughput technology', 'in vivo Model', 'neuromuscular', 'new technology', 'reproductive', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'scale up', 'screening', 'technology development']",NIEHS,NEMALIFE INC.,R43,2021,251040
"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small molecules are one of the most important types of drugs. They also serve as invaluable tools to study biology.

"High Throughput Screen and High Information Follow-Up Tests for Genotoxicants Project Summary  Current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit several critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs, especially for early, high volume screening environments that need to prioritize chemicals for further testing and/or development. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no information provided about genotoxic mode of action. This is severely limiting, as it does not generate key information necessary for prioritizing chemicals for further testing, guiding subsequent assays’ endpoints/experimental designs, or conducting risk assessments. Finally, most current assays do not place requisite emphasis on dose response relationships, and therefore do not contextualize the results in terms of potency. These deficiencies prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where all of these capabilities and high information content are essential. We will solve these issues by developing, optimizing, and validating a two-tiered testing strategy based on multiplexed DNA damage responsive biomarkers and high-speed flow cytometric analysis. The first-tier focuses on throughput and is used to prioritize likely genotoxicants for more comprehensive analysis in second tier testing. Specifically, it involves a collection of several multiplexed biomarkers that will be used to identify likely genotoxic agents and provide a preliminary assessment of genotoxic mode of action. The gH2AX biomarker detects DNA double strand breaks, phospho-histone H3 identifies mitotic cells, nuclear p53 content reports on p53 activation in response to DNA damage, the frequency of 8n+ cells measure polyploidization, and the ratio of nuclei to microsphere counts provides information about treatment-related cytotoxicity. The second tier focuses on information content and considers many more concentrations as well as additional biomarkers, including micronucleus formation. Collectively, the tier two results provide definitive predictions about test chemicals’ genotoxic potential, mode of action, and potency. Over the course of this project we will study more than 3,000 diverse chemicals in order to understand the performance characteristics and generalizability of the two-tiered testing strategy. An interlaboratory trial will be conducted with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods, with the ultimate goal of providing the Nation with commercially available kits and testing services. Project Narrative Some chemicals in commercial use and in the environment can cause DNA damage and this damage can contribute to the development of cancer and other severe diseases. We will develop, optimize, and validate an improved testing strategy based on highly automated processes tracking several DNA damage biomarkers that can be analyzed without the need for animal testing.

"Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity PROJECT SUMMARY  Wildfire occurrence, duration, and intensity have heightened in recent decades and continue to impact the health of millions of individuals worldwide. Smoke that is emitted from wildfires consists of a complex mixture of particulate matter and toxic gases. The chemical composition of wildfire smoke is dependent upon the type of biomass burn conditions and fuel type, which are heavily influenced by geographical region. The chemical mixtures within wildfire smoke that humans are exposed to can consequently cause variable health outcomes through potentially different biological mechanisms. Human exposure to wildfire smoke represents a growing concern in public health, and adequately characterizing health risks associated with biomass smoke across varying burn conditions and geographic areas is not possible with the data currently available.  The variabilities in toxicological responses across wildfire smoke exposure conditions have yet to be fully established and evaluated in the context of chemical composition. The growing threat of wildfires necessitates the elucidation of individual and/or co-occurring components of wildfire smoke that act as the primary drivers of toxicity. To address this important research issue, we expand upon a foundational study that has previously characterized the chemical constituents in various biomass burn scenarios and evaluated, in part, toxicological responses to these exposures in the mouse lung. Here, we leverage this extensive database and banked samples to: 1. characterize in vivo transcriptomic responses and pathway alterations associated with biomass smoke in the mouse lung; 2. integrate chemical-toxicity profiles using computational approaches to prioritize chemicals that are likely driving toxicity responses; and 3. further evaluate chemical drivers of biomass smoke toxicity responses using in vitro approaches.  This research will be carried out through a collaboration with laboratories at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, allowing for a unique combination of expertise for studying the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity. This expertise includes skills in computational toxicology, exposure science, and molecular biology, coupled with experience studying adverse health effects and immune responses induced by exposure to air pollutants. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exposure to wildfire smoke continues to be a growing threat to public health, yet the primary drivers of toxicity and disease are not completely understood. This proposal represents an innovative approach to increase understanding on the health effects of wildfires by leveraging a robust dataset of chemical-biological profiles from mice exposed to biomass smoke condensate samples derived from variable conditions. New data will also be generated alongside additional in vitro testing to more comprehensively examine mechanisms of toxicity and identify the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity, resulting in improved abilities to predict region- specific health risks attributable to wildfires.",Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity,10146388,R21ES031740,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemically Induced Toxicity', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gases', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inhalation', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mus', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Smoke', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Wildfire', 'asthma exacerbation', 'base', 'biomass fuel', 'biomass smoke', 'computational toxicology', 'data integration', 'data reduction', 'data repository', 'experience', 'exposed human population', 'genotoxicity', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'male', 'novel', 'protein biomarkers', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'smoke inhalation', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2021,190241
"Reconstruction of heterogeneous and small macromolecules by cyro-EM PROJECT SUMMARY Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) has recently joined X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy as a high-resolution structural method for biological macromolecules. In addition, cryo-EM produces images of individual molecules, and therefore has the potential to resolve conformational changes. The proposal aims to develop new algorithms and software for extending the application of cryo-EM to molecules that are either too small or too flexible to be mapped by existing computational tools for cryo-EM. This extension requires solving two of the most challenging computational problems posed by cryo-EM. First, mapping the structural variability of macromolecules is widely recognized as the main computational challenge in cryo-EM. Structural variations are of great significance to biologists, as they provide insight into the functioning of molecular machines. Existing computational tools are limited to a small number of distinct conformations, and therefore are incapable of tackling highly mobile biomolecules with multiple, continuous spectra of conformational changes. The first area of investigation in this project is the development of a computational framework to analyze continuous variability. The proposed approach is based on a new mathematical representation of continuously changing structures and its efficient estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. MCMC algorithms have found great success in many other scientific disciplines, yet they have been mostly overlooked for cryo-EM single particle analysis. Second, a major limiting factor for present cryo-EM studies is the molecule size. Images of small molecules (below ~50kDa) have too little signal to allow existing methods to provide valid 3-D reconstructions. It is commonly believed that cryo-EM cannot be used for molecules that are too small to be reliably detected and picked from micrographs. Challenging that widespread belief, the second area of investigation focuses on developing a groundbreaking approach for reconstructing small molecules directly from micrographs without particle picking. The new approach is based on autocorrelation analysis and completely bypasses particle picking and orientation assignment and requires just one pass over the data. The single-pass approach opens new possibilities for real-time processing during data acquisition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Determining structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, and a first step in rational drug design. We propose to develop new, faster and more reliable computer algorithms to significantly increase the power of structure-determination using electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). Importantly, our methods will broaden the application of cryo-EM to molecules that are either too small or too flexible to be mapped by existing techniques.",Reconstruction of heterogeneous and small macromolecules by cyro-EM,10163220,R01GM136780,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Bypass', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Drug Design', 'Fostering', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Ion Channel', 'Ion Pumps', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Markov Chains', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Machines', 'Molecular Motors', 'Molecular Weight', 'Motion', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Particle Size', 'Phase', 'Polymerase', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spliceosomes', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data acquisition', 'expectation', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'molecular mass', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'particle', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'receptor', 'reconstruction', 'small molecule', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,312940
"A Multiwell Plate Format Microfluidic Immobilization Chip for High-Content Imaging of Whole Animals for in vivoNeurotoxicology Testing Project Summary: Neurotoxicological evaluation of new compounds intended for human use or of potential human exposure is mandated by international regulatory bodies and largely relies on lethality testing in higher-order vertebrate animals. High screening costs, long experimental times, and legislative requirements to reduce dependence on animal testing have led many industries to search for alternative technologies. In vitro toxicology testing uses isolated cells or monotypic cell culture and can only provide limited insight since these models lack biologically relevant intact multi-typic cellular network structures. While both technologies have been augmented by in silico technologies, there is still a non-trivial gap between what can be learned and translated from simple, fast, inexpensive in vitro methods versus longer, complex, and costly in vivo studies in higher order animals. Newormics’ approach to filling this gap is to enable in vivo neurotoxicological assessment in Caenorhabditis elegans, an accepted alternative invertebrate model organism, by developing neuron-specific toxicity assays, delivered via a proprietary high-density, large-scale microfluidic immobilization device for high-content, high throughput analysis. Building on advances made during Phase I and important market learnings from participation in the NIH I-Corps program, Phase II proposes several new elements of innovation to achieve our goals in 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will convert our first-generation microfluidic device to a high-density (384- well) vivoChip with improved microfabrication technologies, incorporate on-chip culture for transfer-less exposure and testing, and integrate automation for chip loading, imaging, and analysis. These measures will significantly increase test scale (from 80 compounds per chip to 280) and lower the consumable and labor costs per test. In Aim 2, building on our dopaminergic neurotox assay from Phase I, we will develop four neurotox assays with brightly fluorescently labeled dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons providing the unprecedented ability to assess subtle phenotypic effects of chemicals on individual intact, functional neurons. To achieve real-time image processing, multi-parameter phenotyping, and managing the terabytes of image data generated per test, we will build a computational platform empowered by a graphic user interface. This platform will be used for image compilation, user-annotated phenotype definition and scoring, and automated report generation with appropriate statistical analysis. In Aim 3, with our industry partners, we will validate our platform and assays using reference chemicals. As more chemicals are tested, we will build a database which can be further mined. The outcome of this work will enable many industries to reduce lethal animal testing and get safer industrial and personal consumer products to market faster for economic benefit, reaching regulatory compliance for reduced animal use, and improved healthcare for neurological diseases. Narrative: The proposed work will enable the use of a small invertebrate model organism, C. elegans, for neuron-specific analysis of neurodegeneration phenotypes from high-resolution fluorescence images of individual neurons at high throughputs. The proposed imaging system and the neuron-specific assays will provide an unprecedented ability to assess developmental neurotoxicity in an intact, live, whole organism, down to a neuronal mechanism- of-action level.

"Multimodal Machine-Learning and High Performance Computing Strategies for Big MS Proteomics Data Project Abstract/Summary Mass spectrometry (MS) data is high-dimensional data that is used for large-scale system biology proteomics. The current state of the art mass spectrometers can generate thousands of spectra from a single organism and experiment. This high-dimensional data is processed using database searches and denovo algorithms with varying degrees of success. The overarching objective of this study is to develop, test, integrate and evaluate novel image-processing and deep-learning algorithms that will allow us to deduce and identify reliable peptide sequences in a definitive and quantitative fashion. Our long-term goal is to improve on identification of MS based proteomics data using novel and scalable algorithms. The objective of this proposal is to investigate, design and implement machine-learning deep-learning algorithms for identification of peptides from MS data. Since deep-learning is very good at discovering intricate structures in high-dimensional data it will be ideal solution for discovering dark proteomics data and more accurate deduction of peptides. We predict that the integration of these methods, along with traditional numerical algorithms, will lead to a multimodal fusion-based approach for an optimized and accurate peptide deduction system for large-scale MS data. Further, we will design and implement data augmentation, memory-efficient indexing, and high-performance computing (HPC) to achieve these outcomes more efficiently with a shorter computational time. Therefore, this new line of investigation is significant since it has the potential to improve on long-stalled effort to increase accuracy, reliability and reproducibility of MS data analysis and search tools. The proximate expected outcome of this work is a novel set of deep-learning and image-processing tools which will allow much better insight in MS based proteomics data.

"Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics specifically and potently block the expression of disease-related genes. siRNA clinical utility is currently limited to disease targets in the liver, but the Khvorova lab has developed a novel, fully chemically modified siRNA platform that enables delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) and results in potent modulation of gene expression in mouse and monkey brain for 6 months. This technology provides an opportunity to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders, including Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Extensive chemical modification protects siRNAs from degradation and is essential for in vivo delivery, but lowers the gene silencing efficacy of many siRNA sequences. Bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to predict the activity of non-modified siRNAs, but these algorithms cannot predict whether a chemically modified siRNA will be functional. Identifying a hyperfunctional siRNA chemical modification pattern and developing a predictive algorithm for modified siRNA sequences will be critical for the widespread application of this platform in vivo to treat AD and other genetically-linked neurological disorders. The goal of this proposal is to identify parameters that impact the silencing efficacy of chemically modified siRNAs. Aim 1 will identify the step(s) that limit the activity of chemically modified siRNAs. Using a validated AGO2- immunoprecipitation technique and a small RNA high-throughput sequencing protocol, loading of 32 chemically modified siRNA sequences, each with 3 different chemical modification patterns, into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) will be quantified, and these results will be compared to their in vitro silencing activity. These efforts will provide a data set to determine the impacts of chemistry and sequence on the different steps of RISC function. Aim 2 will design and screen 192 siRNAs in 6 different chemical modification patterns (i.e., for a total of 1152 siRNAs) to systematically assess if and how changes to siRNA sequence and chemical modification patterns impact siRNA efficacy. These 1152 siRNAs will target 4 different mRNAs identified as therapeutic targets for AD. Completing this aim will identify siRNAs that effectively reduce the expression of AD targets. Using multiple bioinformatics analysis methods, including multi-parameter linear regression, support vector machine, and random forest, Aim 3 will model algorithms that specifically predict functional, chemically modified siRNAs. The best performing algorithm will be determined by independent and cross-validations. Completion of this project will decrease the extent of in vitro screening needed to identify functional chemically modified siRNAs capable of targeting disease genes in the CNS and streamline the design of siRNA therapies to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics are a promising class of drugs for the treatment of genetic disorders. Chemical modification of siRNA is necessary for delivery to the central nervous system, but may hinder the efficacy of some siRNAs. This project will define the relationships between siRNA sequence, chemical modification patterns, and efficacy to streamline the development of clinically-relevant siRNAs capable of treating genetically-defined neurological disorders.",Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders,10158011,F31LM013111,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hela Cells', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Huntington Disease', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA Degradation', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Interference Therapy', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA-Induced Silencing Complex', 'Seeds', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Small RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'random forest', 'screening', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic RNA', 'therapeutic target']",NLM,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,F31,2021,31030
"Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders. Abstract: Newborn screening (NBS) using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has transformed our ability to identify and provide early, lifesaving treatment to infants with inborn errors of metabolism. While MS/MS screening identifies most affected babies, it is accompanied by frequent false-positive results that require collecting blood and urine samples for additional confirmatory testing. While DNA sequencing has become an important part of confirmatory testing, newborn dried blood spots (DBS) yield only small and highly variable DNA amounts. There is an urgent need for a more efficient second-tier NBS approach for confirming all screen-positive cases directly from the DBS cards collected at birth. This is especially critical for infants at risk for metabolic disease in their first weeks of life. The overall objective of this proposal is to combine novel DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology to diagnose inborn metabolic disorders from DBS, and to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of this approach for second-tier screening. To achieve this objective, the following specific aims will be pursued: (1) Develop multiplex gene sequencing (RUSPseq) and 10X linked-read sequencing for rapid genetic diagnosis without the need for additional parental testing; (2) Develop mass spectrometry (Q-TOF/LC-MS) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning to identify novel metabolic markers, which will be integrated in a novel second-tier screening panel to separate true and false-positive cases; and (3) Demonstrate clinical and translational feasibility of this approach to more rapidly identify both true and false-positive cases. We will work with the public NBS program and NBSTRN’s Pilot Research and Implementation workgroup to translate this combined approach into second-tier NBS. These outcomes will have significant impact by reducing diagnostic delays and uncertainties, and by reducing iterative testing rounds and the cost associated with them, thereby reducing the burden on the healthcare system as well as patients and their families. Project Narrative: We will establish novel genetic and metabolomic technology for newborn screening (NBS) from dried blood spots, and apply machine learning to reduce false-positive screens and delayed diagnosis of true-positive cases. Early detection and confirmation of inborn errors of metabolism that can present in the first weeks of life is critical, specifically when screening in diverse multiethnic populations where we have less understanding of the biochemical genetic and clinical phenotypes. We will work with local hospitals and the NBS program to establish clinical and translational validity to this new project, which will contribute to maintaining parental trust in public NBS.",Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders.,10251254,R01HD102537,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Compound Q', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Inborn Errors of Metabolism', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Work', 'carrier status', 'case control', 'clinical phenotype', 'cost', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'improved', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'random forest', 'screening', 'screening panel', 'screening program', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'web-based tool']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,505339
"In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions. IN-SILICO PREDICTION OF PROTEIN-PEPTIDE INTERACTIONS Automated docking methods are used extensively for gaining a mechanistic understanding of the molecular interactions underpinning cellular processes. While these tools work well for small molecules they perform poorly for peptides and cannot handle Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) which play very important roles in these processes. The goal of this project is the development of an efficient and practical peptide docking software, useful for designing therapeutic peptides and gaining insight into IDPs binding ordered proteins. The proposed software supports biomedical applications ranging from investigating chemical pathways to designing and optimizing therapeutic molecules for diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders. Under the previous award we developed and released a new method for docking fully-flexible peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids: AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP). We showed that it outperforms current state-of-the-art docking methods. For the next award, we propose to: 1) further develop ADCP to support docking IPDs with up to 70 amino acids and improve support for therapeutic peptides containing modified amino acids and complex macrocycles; 2) develop peptide-specific scoring functions to increase docking success rates and methods for predicting the free energy of binding of peptides. This will be done by exploiting the latest advances in statistical potentials for docking, as well as applying machine-learning techniques; 3) test and validate the software on our datasets, community benchmarks, and through our collaborations with outstanding biologists working on biomedical applications spanning from designing drugs for thrombosis and influenza, to modeling IDPs interacting with globular proteins; and 4) document the software and release it under an open source license on a regular basis along with datasets we compile and update on regularly. The proposed research will occur in the context of collaborations with experimental biologists working on highly relevant biomedical projects and providing experimental feedback and validation. In addition, this project will benefit from various collaborations with experts in the fields of computational biology, applied mathematics and artificial intelligence. This docking software tool will be developed by applying best practices in software engineering and be implemented as a modular, extensible, component-based software framework for peptide docking. This docking engine will be part of the widely used AutoDock software suite. The ability to model complexes formed by proteins and fully-flexible peptides or IDPs is in high demand and will greatly extend the range of peptide-based therapeutic approaches for which automated docking can be successfully applied. It will also support gaining insights into interactions of IDPs with proteins. As such, it will impact the research of many medicinal chemists and biologist and extend the use of computational tools to a wider community of scientists, thereby supporting the advancement of biomedical research. Automated docking is a workhorse for rational drug design, however, applying these methods to peptides has remained challenging, thus impeding the designing of therapeutic peptides and the study of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP) binding to their ordered partners. During the prior funding period, we made substantial progress toward peptide docking, resulting in a new docking engine: AutoDock CrankPep, which outperforms state-of-the-art docking methods for linear and cyclic peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids. We propose to further develop AutoDock CrankPep to support docking of therapeutic peptides with modified amino acids as well as IDPs with up to 70 amino acids, creating a practical docking tool for peptides that will impact the research of many computational and medicinal chemists and biologist, contribute to our understanding of biological processes, and significantly advance biomedical research.",In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions.,10259801,R01GM096888,"['Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Cyclic Peptides', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Drug Design', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Influenza', 'Insulin', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Renaissance', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Framework', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombosis', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'design', 'flexibility', 'globular protein', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in silico', 'insight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'open source', 'peptide drug', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'receptor', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'translational study', 'virtual screening']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,399375
"Administrative Supplement: Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We cannot yet look at a chemical structure and predict if the molecule will have an odor, much less what character it will have. The goal of the proposed research is to apply machine learning to predict perceptual characteristics from chemical features of molecules. The specific aims of the proposal will determine (1) which molecules are odorous , and (2) what data are needed to model odor character. Building a highly predictive model requires two key ingredients: high-quality data and a sound modeling approach. High-quality data must be accurate (ratings are consistent and describe true odor properties) and detailed (ratings describe even small differences in odor properties). We have collected human psychophysical data on a diverse set of molecules and have trained a model to predict if a molecule has an odor, but pilot data identified odorous contaminants that limit model training and measurement of model accuracy. In Aim 1, I will apply my background in analytical chemistry to evaluate the accuracy of the data, using gas chromatography to identify and correct errors caused by chemical contaminants. In Aim 2, I will apply my experience in human sensory evaluation to measure and compare the consistency and the degree of detail in ratings that can be achieved with different sensory methods and subject training procedures. By executing my training plan, I will develop the skills in statistical programming and machine learning needed to employ a sound modeling approach to these problems. The model constructed in Aim 1 will enable prediction of odor classification (odor/odorless) for any molecule and thus define which molecules are perceptually relevant. Predicting odor character is a far more complex challenge – while a molecule can have only one of two odor classifications (odor or odorless) it may elicit any number of diverse odor character attributes (fruity, floral, musky, sweet, etc.). Descriptive Analysis (DA) is the gold standard method for generating accurate and detailed sensory profiles, but this method is time-consuming. We estimate that an odor character dataset will be large enough (“model-ready”) to predict odor character with approximately 10,000 molecules and that it would require more than 30,000 hours of human subject evaluation, or approximately 6 years for the typical trained panel, to produce this dataset using DA. Before we invest the time and resources, it is responsible to evaluate the relative data quality of more rapid sensory methods. The results of Aim 2 are expected to determine the best approach for generating a model-ready dataset by quantifying trade-offs in degree of detail (data resolution), rating consistency, and method speed of five candidate sensory methods. Together, these aims represent a significant step forward in linking chemical recipe to human odor perception, an advancement that supports the NIDCD goal of understanding normal olfactory function (how stimulus relates to percept) and has many potential applications in foods (what composition of molecules should be present to produce a target aroma percept). PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, scientists cannot predict whether a molecule will have an odor and, if so, what odor characteristics it will have based on its chemical structure. The goal of this project is to develop predictive models linking chemical composition to odor characteristics. These models will advance our understanding of the human olfactory system and help design strategies for improving the aroma and palatability of healthy foods.",Administrative Supplement: Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure,10405294,F32DC019030,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Food', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Food', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Palate', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Programmed Learning', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysics', 'Quality Control', 'Recipe', 'Research', 'Research Technics', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'data quality', 'design', 'experience', 'food science', 'human subject', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model building', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'skills', 'sound']",NIDCD,MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER,F32,2021,2500
"Unified Computation Tools for Natural Products Research Summary The overarching goal for this proposed renewal application will be to further advance tools that are in development and to effectively integrate several types of analytical data with biological assay data and genomic information. This will create a powerful set of tools for faster and even more accurate identification of new molecules, dereplication of known ones, and to directly infer biological activities from spectroscopic information. In the current period of support, we have made substantial progress in developing highly useful tools for automatic annotations and identifications of organic molecules, specifically focused on natural products. The Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Networking analysis and knowledge dissemination ecosystem has processed almost 160,000 jobs in nearly 160 countries worldwide, has 4-6,000 new job submissions per month and is accessed over 200,000 times a month (majority accessions are for reference library access, inspection of public data and previous jobs that the community shares as hyperlinks in papers), and has become a mainstream tool for the annotation of organic molecules deriving from diverse sources, especially in metabolomics workflows. The public website for Small Molecule Accurate Recognition Technology (SMART), a deep learning model for providing candidate structures based on 1H-13C HSQC NMR data, went live in December 2019 and already has over 3000 jobs in 50 countries. All tools developed in this proposal will become part of this analysis ecosystem. The four laboratories contributing to this proposed research activity have created an open and integrated team that is continuing to creatively innovate new informatic tools to enhance small molecule structure annotations and inference of their chemical and biological properties. We have four specific aims: 1) To complete the development and evaluation of a set of new and innovative tools for natural products analysis, and deploy these as freely available resources for the worldwide community. 2) To refine the structural characterization of molecules through leveraging repository scale mass spectral information along with NMR data and genomic inputs. 3) To create a new SMART-based tool that integrates mass spectrometry and HSQC NMR data as the input for a new deep learning system with the goal of achieving more accurate predictions of structure. 4) To use deep learning to enhance SMART with bioactivity data so as to enable SMART to predict activities of molecules based on spectroscopic features. The data will also augment the GNPS database with biological assay binding data. An additional consequence of these goals will be the further digitization of natural products analytical data so that they can be used in the computational tools planned herein, as well as other tools in the future. Completion of these four specific aims will create new integrated tools for the precise identification of new natural product structures, and enable inference of their structural relatedness to other classes of organic molecules and their biological properties. Thus, these new informatic tools will have the potential to greatly enhance the small molecule drug discovery process.         Unified Computational Tools for Natural Products Research Approximately 50% of all FDA approved drugs trace their origins to natural products, either directly or through indirect routes of development. To accelerate and make more efficient the study of natural products, we are developing innovative computational tools for the rapid annotation of natural product structures and their associated chemical and biological properties.",Unified Computation Tools for Natural Products Research,10211176,R01GM107550,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Natural Products', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Occupations', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Route', 'Source', 'Spectrometry', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'drug discovery', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'marine natural product', 'metabolomics', 'quantum', 'repository', 'small molecule', 'social', 'tool', 'web site']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,547104
"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning",10140254,R21AA028432,"['Alcohol-Induced Disorders', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcoholic liver damage', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Ethanol', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Steatohepatitis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol research', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'global health', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'intrahepatic', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'protein metabolite', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'sobriety', 'specific biomarkers', 'tissue injury', 'tool']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,202259

"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine.

"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents. The access to these custom reagents will accelerate biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation,10109124,R01GM129313,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nucleotides', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tyrosine', 'Work', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'data analysis pipeline', 'functional group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'virtual']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,314000
"Biomedical Raman Imaging Workshop Summary The purpose of the planned conference is to facilitate development of Raman-spectroscopy based clinical appli- cations.  Raman scattering provides label-free contrast for imaging that derives from intrinsic molecular vibrations. Because it is label-free and reports in an unbiased way on all molecular species in a sample, it provides a holistic “view” of the chemical environment in clinical samples, and thus holds signiﬁcant value as a diagnostic and treatment monitoring tool.  While the phenomenon of Raman scattering has been known since 1920, and its clinical potential has been recognized for many decades, roadblocks including weak signal levels and complexity of its readout has precluded it from clinical use. These roadblocks are now being removed through innovations in instrument development and machine learning. Narrative Raman spectroscopy provides diagnostically important chemical proﬁles of clinical samples, withouth the need of labeling. Throgh this it holds tremendous potential to improve many diagnostic and monitoring aspects of healthcare. The purpose of this workshop is to facilitate efﬁcient development of these techniques in a way that will be clinically acceptable.",Biomedical Raman Imaging Workshop,10318774,R13EB032251,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Fingerprint', 'Fruit', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'In Situ', 'Label', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Paper', 'Pathogen detection', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Publishing', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'contrast imaging', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'liquid biopsy', 'screening', 'symposium', 'technique development', 'technology development', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vibration']",NIBIB,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R13,2021,9996
