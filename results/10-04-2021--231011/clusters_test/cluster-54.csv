"Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science Project Summary/Abstract The study of the human brain with neuroimaging technologies is at the cusp of an exciting era of Big Data. Many data collection projects, such as the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, have made large, high- quality datasets of human neuroimaging data freely available to researchers. These large data sets promise to provide important new insights about human brain structure and function, and to provide us the clues needed to address a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, neuroscience researchers still face substantial challenges in capitalizing on these data, because these Big Data require a different set of technical and theoretical tools than those that are required for analyzing traditional experimental data. These skills and ideas, collectively referred to as Data Science, include knowledge in computer science and software engineering, databases, machine learning and statistics, and data visualization.  The Summer Institute in Data Science for Neuroimaging will combine instruction by experts in data science methodology and by leading neuroimaging researchers that are applying data science to answer scientiﬁc ques- tions about the human brain. In addition to lectures on the theoretical background of data science methodology and its application to neuroimaging, the course will emphasize experiential hands-on training in problem-solving tutorials, as well as project-based learning, in which the students will create small projects based on openly available datasets. Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science: Project Narrative The Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science will provide training in modern data science tools and methods, such as programming, data management, machine learning and data visualization. Through lectures, hands-on training sessions and team projects, it will empower scientists from a variety of backgrounds in the use of these tools in research on the human brain and on neurological and psychiatric brain disorders.",Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science,10129428,R25MH112480,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Science Core', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Habits', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'computer science', 'connectome', 'data management', 'data visualization', 'design', 'e-science', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'lectures', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'project-based learning', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'summer institute', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R25,2021,206030
"Education Pathways for Biomedical Data Science (R25) Project Summary / Abstract This project brings together Drexel University and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) to create an adaptive Biomedical Data Science education program to empower researchers to learn and use emerging data science methods. We propose an in-line program to prepare researchers for data-driven work directly in their current field, while also identifying avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration. We will develop novel curricula pathways, leverage existing educational resources, create bridge materials, and provide practicum “lab” activities matching domain-specific projects to participants for hands-on experience. Educational Pathways in Biomedical Data Science will collaborate with the CHOP Office of Academic Training and Outreach Programs to engage a diverse learner audience in novel pedagogical research. Learners will be recruited from active participants in many existing CHOP training initiatives, including a novel data science education program, graduate student training, postdoc mentorship, physician fellowship research, and clinical research staff training. After enrollment, education program managers will cluster participants into collaborative communities of practice where they will receive mentorship and contribute to development of pathways. We acknowledge that we are still learning the most effective interventions for biomedical data science education, both within our specific communities and broadly within medical education (e.g. Federer et al., 2015; Rowhani-Faarid, Allen, and Barnett, 2017). We will develop new evidence of gaps in knowledge, skills, and attitudes among learners. We will develop and implement biomedical data science literacy instruments based on emerging scholarship. We will also gather learner feedback via mixed methods to adapt and evolve our modular resources, ensure robust learner outcomes, and align deliverables with the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science. Data Science instruction for researchers outside of traditional computer and information sciences is a concrete step toward data-driven scientific literacy for all. We will ensure that participants emerge from this program with computational and algorithmic literacy solidified through hands-on experience. For non-computing researchers, we also will provide the foundational data fluencies necessary for individuals to contribute meaningfully to machine learning research, which will enable data-driven systems, insight-to-decision transformation, decision- making, and data-driven decision management. Finally, for all participants, we will strive to help individuals from a broad spectrum of backgrounds and identities identify new directions in which to develop their careers. Project Narrative “Educational Pathways in Biomedical Data Science” will create evidence-based pathways to guide and augment researcher skill in data-intensive science. Our learning pathways and supporting modules will equip researchers to perform nimble research with massive datasets that span institutional and disciplinary boundaries. We will model cross-disciplinary collaboration by building upon an existing partnership between the College of Computing and Informatics of Drexel University and the Research Institute of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, grounding the project in both computing and biomedical research practice.",Education Pathways for Biomedical Data Science (R25),10199482,R25GM141501,"['Academic Training', 'Attitude', 'Biomedical Research', 'Certification', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community of Practice', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Degree program', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Sciences', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Education', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Peer Review', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Plant Roots', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scholarship', 'Science', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'acronyms', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'cohort', 'college', 'computer science', 'education pathway', 'education resources', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'formative assessment', 'graduate student', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'literacy', 'novel', 'online course', 'outreach program', 'pedagogy', 'programs', 'science education', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'statistics', 'student training', 'success', 'user centered design']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R25,2021,85673
"Arizona Technology Development and Clinical Education Program for Students in Kidney Health (ADVANCE Kidney Health) PROJECT SUMMARY  To expand the kidney-related biomedical workforce and counter the increasing disparity between the growing prevalence of renal disease and the disproportionate level of trainees, researchers and practitioners in nephrology and kidney health, we developed the Arizona Technology Development and Clinical Education Program for Students in Kidney Health (ADVANCE Kidney Health). ADVANCE Kidney Health is an education- based, hands-on research, education and clinical experience that applies pillars of 1) science, medical and engineering education; 2) training in innovation, entrepreneurialism and scientific translation; 3) experiential learning, mentorship and clinical immersion; and 4) needs-based application and practical translation – all aimed at producing motivated, trained and committed biomedical trainees interested in renal health and science to advance the workforce and develop the new health-related therapies of the future. The program recruits undergraduate students from across 15 departments within the College of Engineering at the University of Arizona (UArizona) that include: Biomedical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Chemical Engineering. ADVANCE Kidney Health is structured to provide trainees a medical school experience for early-stage undergraduate learners geared to instill an understanding of renal anatomy and kidney function. The core structure accesses a clinical experience to instill a motivation to pursue kidney- related patient care and/or translational research and progresses to an already established innovation bootcamp that culminates in an interdisciplinary capstone that has doubled in size over 10 years and accesses by more than 450 captive engineering students. The program leverages new infrastructure in medical and engineering education along with transdisciplinary programs aimed at innovation, technology development and entrepreneurialism with 15 physician navigators in kidney health and 23 engineering and scientific mentors spanning renal physiology, biomedical engineering, optical sciences and machine learning. The result is an interrelated program that bridges renal medicine, engineering and product development to develop new pipelines and on-ramps to impact career decisions and grow the future kidney-related workforce. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The prevalence of end-stage renal failure (ESRD) has increased ~40% over 20 years, but the kidney-related biomedical workforce has been unable to keep pace. New pathways to a career in nephrology and kidney-related medicine and research are vitally needed that combine early and frequent experiential opportunities to engage in patient-oriented kidney care and contribute to innovative technologies that will one-day change how renal dysfunction is diagnosed and treated. ADVANCE Kidney Health responds to this need by assembling diverse mentors, interdisciplinary infrastructure and novel engineering technologies to impact career trajectories and develop the new technological cures of tomorrow.",Arizona Technology Development and Clinical Education Program for Students in Kidney Health (ADVANCE Kidney Health),10230895,R25DK128859,"['Active Learning', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Arizona', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'Career Mobility', 'Caring', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Critical Thinking', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Hypertension', 'Immersion', 'Infrastructure', 'Internal Medicine', 'Internships', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laws', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Motivation', 'Nephrology', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Problem Solving', 'Ramp', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Solid', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Universities', 'base', 'bridge program', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'career development', 'career preparation', 'cohort', 'college', 'design', 'early experience', 'education research', 'experience', 'fascinate', 'graduate student', 'hands on research', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'kidney dysfunction', 'medical schools', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'product development', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'summer research', 'technology development', 'undergraduate education', 'undergraduate student']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R25,2021,140400

"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,10187539,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'JUUL', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detection platform', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2021,399000
"An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning Abstract: The next generation of science and health care professionals will need to understand the foundational concepts of physics. While textbooks play a critical role in science learning, these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. Unfortunately, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current physical science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with interactive texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned force and motion (NGSS PS2A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing and developing science learning games (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content in both English and Spanish to address 9 additional NGSS standards (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive learning technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning disabilities. This Fast-Track project will produce a bilingual, digital platform to support students’ understanding of Physical Science, which will allow students to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages, play science learning games, and receive personalized content. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students, develop teacher support materials, and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning",10303076,R44GM137622,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Books', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'efficacy evaluation', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'physical science', 'reading ability', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2021,774997

"Reproducible and FAIR Bioinformatics Analysis of Omics Data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Modern biomedical research is increasingly quantitative. The next generation of researchers will need an entirely new set of quantitative skills to fully take advantage of the data they create. In response to this need, the goal of the current R25 proposal is to transform an existing, 5-day bioinformatics techniques course into a new, two-week short course, Reproducible and FAIR Bioinformatics Analysis of Omics Data, to provide a unique educational opportunity for biomedical research scientists-in-training to begin to develop core competencies in bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses of large datasets. The new course will also address NIH priorities including rigor and reproducibility and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data principles. During the last five years, the Dartmouth faculty who are serving as Principal Investigators have taught a 5-day course at the MDI Biological Laboratory on bioinformatics and biostatistics to ~40 trainees/year (202 total). Based on overwhelmingly positive feedback, the current project will extend this 5-day course into a longer, two-week short course at the MDI Biological Laboratory that will feature a low student-to- instructor ratio (5:1), more hands-on experiential learning, and exceptional faculty who are highly experienced in teaching and performing big-data analyses. The new course is designed to accommodate ~35 trainees per year (175 total over the five-year R25 project). It will incorporate modules on biostatistics, scientific rigor and reproducibility, and FAIR data principles. The course design will also involve a short conceptual presentation, followed by an exercise in which students will gain confidence by applying a new skill. Each active-learning session will have three levels of difficulty (beginner, intermediate, and advanced) to allow each student to progress at their own pace. The low student-to-faculty ratio will allow course facilitators to guide participants through realistic challenges without causing frustration. The specific aims of the proposed course include: Specific Aim 1. Develop a two-week short course primarily for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students that improves their ability to design and analyze omics experiments such as RNA-seq, 16S (microbiome), metagenomics, and sc-RNA-seq data; Specific Aim 2. Enhance the impact of research by biomedical scientists by teaching them the Responsible Conduct of Research, the secure and ethical use of data, as well as rigor and reproducibility and FAIR data principles; Specific Aim 3. Disseminate the training curriculum to a broad audience; and Specific Aim 4. Evaluate the short- and long-term impacts of the course on students, including a long-term follow-up to determine students’ confidence in and actual integration of bioinformatics, biostatistics, and FAIR data principles into their research, and the reported impact of this course on their career trajectory and competitiveness in the job market. In summary, the proposed course will provide a unique cross- training, educational opportunity for biomedical research scientists-in-training to begin to develop core competency in bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses of large data sets.

"Patient Oriented Research and Mentorship and Training in Functional Neuroimaging of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ABSTRACT  This K24 Mid-Career Investigator Career Development Award seeks support for training and mentorship for Christopher Pittenger, MD, Ph.D., a well-established, tenured Associate Professor in Psychiatry at Yale University, Director of the Yale OCD Research Clinic, and Assistant Chair for Translational Research in the Department of Psychiatry. Dr. Pittenger leads a robust patient-oriented research (POR) research program, which is integrated with his basic/translational lab-based research and has produced important new insights into the neurobiological underpinnings and novel treatment avenues for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome (TS). Dr. Pittenger has a long-standing commitment to mentorship; most notably, he is Co-Director of the Neuroscience Research Training Program (NRTP), the research track within the Yale psychiatry residency.  The training plan supported by this grant will allow Dr. Pittenger to increase his skills in quantitative analysis, with a focus on advanced statistical methods and on the design and analysis of fMRI studies. These are areas in which he already has active research with expert collaborators; the aim of the proposed training plan is to enhance his own proficiency to make him a more effective collaborator and mentor in these important domains. Additional training is focused on his own abilities as a mentor and leader, with the goal of increasing his efficacy in the management of his own research groups and in effective and individualized mentorship. These training activities will take place in the context of two NIMH- funded research studies. The first, R01 MH116038, is a recently funded grant on which Dr. Pittenger is co-PI with his close collaborator Alan Anticevic and deploys cutting-edge imaging technology and data analysis approaches to examine brain network connectivity parallels and predictors of therapeutic response to pharmacotherapy in OCD. The second, R01 MH100068, is a grant with collaborator Michelle Hampson that is developing real-time fMRI neurofeedback as a probe and potential treatment for OCD, with promising early results. These two exciting projects provide a fruitful vehicle for the proposed training in statistics and neuroimaging.  Dr. Pittenger will devote substantial time to mentoring under this award. One major focus will be the NRTP; the plan is for him to take over as Director of this program over the next few years, and to take the lead in the next resubmission of our T32 grant in 2022. Support of this increased mentorship effort is a second major motivation for the current application. Dr. Pittenger will also provide mentorship to students, postdocs, and junior faculty in his own research program and throughout the Department of Psychiatry  Together, these integrated plans for training, research, and mentorship will support a well-established mid-career investigator whose robust research program is producing important insights into the neurobiology and treatment of OCD and TS, and whose dedicated mentorship efforts are helping to establish a new generation of translationally grounded patient-oriented researchers in psychiatric neuroscience.

"Automated Risk Assessment for School Violence Prevention PROJECT SUMMARY Acts of school violence have increased over the past decade and over 20% of students report being bullied at school. School violence has a far-reaching impact on the entire school population, including staff, students and families. It was noted that the largest crime-prevention results occurred when youth at elevated risk were given effective prevention programs. As such, there is a critical need for developing a rapid and accurate approach to interview students, assess their risk characteristics, and provide supportive evidence for prevention. Our study focuses on detecting and preventing youth aggression, the predominant form of school violence. Several risk assessment scales, ranging from simple clinical impressions to structured professional judgments, have been proposed to identify youth violence. However, these assessments heavily rely on clinicians' subjec- tive impressions and their predictive validities remain a major issue. In addition, none of the risk assessments include direct analysis of the words (language) used by students and hence, provide little information to sup- port subsequent prevention. Our long-term goal is to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system to analyze participant interviews, detect elevated-risk students, and provide risk characteristics (e.g., impul- sivity, negative thoughts) to assist prevention. In our earlier study we developed a risk assessment approach to interview students and evaluate their risk of aggression. The overall objective of this study is to validate our risk assessment approach with real-world evidence, and to develop an AIRA system to automate the assessment process. We hypothesize that our risk assessment approach will have sufficient predictive validity in predicting aggression at school, and a computerized system leveraging machine learning and natural language pro- cessing (NLP) will be able to detect high-risk students, identify violence-related predictors from linguistic con- tent, and improve subsequent prevention by assisting recommendations. The hypothesis will be tested by pur- suing three specific aims: 1) Evaluate the predictive validity and generalizability of our risk assessment approach with prospectively collected school-based outcomes; 2) Develop a high-performing ARIA system to identify risk characteristics and predict risk of school violence; and 3) Compare actionable recommenda- tions and school outcomes with and without using the ARIA system in a prospective observational study. The study is highly innovative in that it will be among the first efforts that leverage NLP and machine learning to analyze interviews, identify risk characteristics from student language, and predict violence outcomes. The study will have a significant impact on several fronts. Successful validation of our risk assessment approach on multiple sites (Aim 1) will provide a valid mechanism to detect youth aggression at school. The AIRA system developed in Aim 2 will enable accurate and scalable risk screening for individual students. Aim 3 is a bench-to-practice translational aim to rapidly transfer our findings to clinical practice. The study will help establish a nationwide solution for school violence risk assessment, which will benefit healthcare institutions, schools, and students. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study aims to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system to analyze participant interviews, detect students at elevated risk of school violence, and provide risk characteristics to assist prevention. The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing an ARIA system will help establish a nationwide solution for detecting and preventing school violence. The objectives of this proposal are consistent with NICHD's high-priority research areas that aim to develop new knowledge about the identification, etiology, early intervention, and mechanisms of violence from childhood through early adulthood.",Automated Risk Assessment for School Violence Prevention,10096109,R01HD103630,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Early Intervention', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Legal Guardians', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Process Assessment', 'Property', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'bullying', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'school violence', 'school violence prevention', 'screening', 'study population', 'youth violence']",NICHD,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,457950
"Improving Virtual Gross Anatomy: Enhancing the Information Content of Cadaveric CT Scans Project Summary The long-term goal of this research is to establish a pipeline for automated image processing that enhances cadaveric non-contrast enhanced (NCE) CT data and extracts meaningful models and metrics to improve anatomy research and education. The objective is to develop the necessary toolset for this image processing, and feature extraction. The central hypothesis is that it is possible to enrich the information content of biomedical imaging data, particularly that of cadaveric NCE CT imaging, for use in gross anatomy education and research. The rationale behind this project is that cadaveric dissection, while an important part of anatomy education, is limited due to sample size, infrastructure, cost, and time. Biomedical imaging can preserve specimens for posterity and be used to supplement this material by providing statistical and quantitative information from anatomical structures. This research will attempt to establish a working pipeline for efficient information extraction through the following specific aims: (1) Improving inter-observer anatomical agreement in cadaveric CT scans; (2) Develop an approach to automatically segment anatomical structures from non-contrast enhanced CT images; and (3) Establish normal variation of anatomical structures and its relationship to pathologies. This project is innovative because it applies artificial intelligence to efficiently extract anatomical information from cadaveric NCE CT imaging, which has only been performed with traditional registration- dependent methods that often fail and are domain specific, acting on a single organ at a time. In addition, this project works with multi-species data to enhance human image data.  This project is significant because it will allow students to understand anatomical variation better by both expanding student exposure to more samples, while also extracting useful representations and analytics from these samples for education and research. The expected outcome of this project is a toolset that is capable of enhancing anatomy education and research by increasing soft-tissue contrast, automatically segmenting the kidneys, liver, mandible, and intraosseus sites of the cranial nerves, and performing statistical analysis on these organs, including but not limited to statistical shape modelling and shape analysis. This will have a positive impact on anatomical education and student retention because it will provide students with a broader range of sample variability information which will decrease pervading biases in medical training that result from small, limited sample sizes, and improve medical training. Project Narrative Dissection is a critical component of anatomy education but is limited due to the infrastructure required by the institution, the amount of variability in the available specimens, and the limited number of specimens available within the course. Biomedical imaging and analysis can be used to supplement dissection, allowing for an expansion in the number of anatomical specimens that students can observe and the amount of clinically relevant material that is available to students to improve their understanding of pathology and variation. This will expand student exposure to anatomical variation, produce more proficient medical professionals, and improve anatomy research.",Improving Virtual Gross Anatomy: Enhancing the Information Content of Cadaveric CT Scans,10141430,F31EB030904,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood coagulation', 'Buffaloes', 'Cadaver', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Education', 'Exposure to', 'Gifts', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Mandible', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Students', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Preservation Technique', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'education research', 'feature extraction', 'human imaging', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'non-invasive imaging', 'posters', 'preservation', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'retention rate', 'segmentation algorithm', 'shape analysis', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'virtual']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,F31,2021,30805
"Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium Project Summary/Abstract The Arkansas Research Alliance proposes to hold five annual workshops on the subject of bioinformatics. The purpose is to bring six major Arkansas institutions into closer collaboration. Those institutions are: University of Arkansas-Fayetteville; Arkansas State University; University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences; University of Arkansas at Little Rock; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff; and the National Center for Toxicological Research. The workshops will focus on capabilities at each of the six in sciences related to bioinformatics including artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, food and agriculture, high speed computing, and visualization capabilities. As this work progresses, educational coordination and student encouragement will be important components. Principals from all six institutions are collaborating to accomplish the workshop goals. Project Narrative The FDA ability to protect the public health is directly related to its ability to access and utilize the latest scientific data. Increased proficiency in collecting, presenting, validating, understanding, and drawing quantitative inference from the massive volume of new scientific results is necessary for success in that effort. The complexity involved requires continued development of new tools available and being developed within the realm of information technology, and the workshops proposed here will address this need. Specific Aims  • Thoroughly understand the resources in Arkansas available for furthering the capabilities in  bioinformatics and its associated needs, e.g., access to high speed computing capability and use  of computational tools. • Develop a set of plans to harness and grow those capabilities, especially those that are relevant  to the needs of NCTR and FDA. • Stimulate interest and capability across Arkansas in bioinformatics to produce a larger cadre of  expertise as these plans are implemented. • Enlist NCTR’s help in directing the effort toward seeking local, national and international data  that can be more effectively analyzed to produce results needed by FDA and others, e.g.,  reviewing decades of genomic/treatment data on myeloma patients at the University of  Arkansas for Medical Sciences. • Develop ways in which the Arkansas capabilities can be combined into a coordinated, synergistic  force larger than the sum of its parts. • Encourage students and faculty in the development of new models and techniques to be used in  bioinformatics and related fields. • Improve inter-institutional communication, including developing standardized bioinformatics  curricula and more universal course acceptance.",Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium,10214625,R13FD006690,[' '],FDA,ARKANSAS RESEARCH ALLIANCE,R13,2021,3125
"Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The emergence of electronic medical records, large data registries and readily accessible, protected servers have resulted in an explosion of digital information with potentially high clinical impact for improving patient management and outcomes. Big data warehouses that capture standardized information within the scope of clinical practices allow trained scientists to not only engage in traditional hypothesis testing, but to also uncover new hypotheses, refine existing theories and apply new discoveries to health assessments and interventions. Despite the accessibility and potential impact of these data platforms, clinician scientists have traditionally directed experiments that incorporate relatively small sample sizes and data from individual laboratories, and have not been trained in big data analytics or in engaging appropriate team scientists who work in this space, such as computer scientists, biostatisticians and engineers. The overarching goal of this proposal is to mentor early patient oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analytics and to mentor and involve early data science scholars in communication and swallowing research. The PI proposes four primary mentorship and research goals in this K24 renewal proposal: 1. Train a cadre of early stage communication and swallowing scientists in data science methods, including machine learning, by an expert, interdisciplinary, collaborative data science team, 2. Engage and introduce early career data scientists from fields of biostatistics, computer science and engineering to communication and swallowing sciences, and respective data sets, toward facilitating interdisciplinary data science teams and research productivity, 3. Apply novel data science methods to identify phenotypes of swallowing impairment and severity classifications in patient groups known to be at high risk for nutritional and health complications related to dysphagia, and 4. Develop a new area of research in machine learning applications toward improving reliability of physiologic swallowing assessment. The data science theme of the career development and research plan directly align with NIDCD's Strategic Plan for Data Science which lists as its mission: Storing, managing, standardizing and publishing the vast amounts of data produced by biomedical research. NIDCD recognizes that accessible, well-organized, secure and efficiently operated data resources are critical to modern scientific inquiry…and by maximizing the value of data generated through NIH-funded efforts, the pace of biomedical discoveries and medical breakthroughs for better health outcomes can be accelerated. PROJECT NARRATIVE The emergence of electronic health records exposes clinicians to massive amounts of information about the millions of patients who suffer from communication and swallowing disorders, yet most clinical scientists do not have the training or skill to apply meaning to the data toward improving patient care. The overarching mentorship goal of this proposal is to train early, patient-oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analyses, including computer machine learning approaches. The research project will uncover distinct patterns and severity of swallowing impairments in large groups of patients with high risk medical diagnoses, which will have high impact on patient care planning and identification of treatments that directly target these impairments for improved outcomes.",Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders,10073493,K24DC012801,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Barium swallow', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'data registry', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'health assessment', 'high risk', 'human error', 'impression', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'uptake']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,K24,2021,183209
"Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY In this dawning era of `Big Data' it is vital to recruit and train the next generation of biomedical data scientists in `Big Data'. The collection of `Big Data' in the biomedical sciences is growing rapidly and has the potential to solve many of today's pressing medical needs including personalized medicine, eradication of disease, and curing cancer. Realizing the benefits of Big Data will require a new generation of leaders in (bio)statistical and computational methods who will be able to develop the approaches and tools necessary to unlock the information contained in large heterogeneous datasets. There is a great need for scientists trained in this specialized, highly heterogeneous, and interdisciplinary new field of health big data. Thus, the recruitment of talented undergraduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs is vital to our ability to tap into the potential that `Big Data' offers and the challenges that it presents. The University of Michigan Undergraduate Summer Institute: Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data will primarily draw from the expertise and experience of faculty from three different departments within three different schools at the University of Michigan: Biostatistics in the School of Public Health, Computer Science in the School of Engineering, Statistics in the College of Literature, Sciences and the Arts. The faculty instructors and mentors have backgrounds in Statistics, Computer Science, Information Science, Medicine, Population Health, Social and Biological Sciences. They have active research programs in a broad spectrum of methodological areas including statistical modeling, data mining, natural language processing, statistical and machine learning, large-scale optimization, matrix computation, medical computing, health informatics, high- dimensional statistics, distributed computing, missing data, causal inference, data management and integration, signal processing and medical imaging. The diseases and conditions they study include obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurological disease, kidney disease, injury, macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. The areas of biology include neuroscience, genetics, genomics, metabolomics, epigenetics and socio-behavioral science. Undergraduate trainees selected will have strong quantitative skills and a background in STEM. The summer institute will consist of a combination of coursework, to raise the skills and interests of the participants to a sufficient level to consider pursuing graduate studies in `Big Data' science, along with an in depth mentoring component that will allow the participants to research a specific topic/project utilizing `Big Data'. We have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm and success with the current summer program on Big Data led by this team with 164 students trained in the last 4 years (2015-2018) including 90 female students and 30 students from underrepresented minority groups. Fourteen of these participants from the last three years are currently graduate students in Michigan Biostatistics. The ongoing program has gained traction in the national landscape of summer research programs with 20% rate of admission and 80% rate of acceptance among those who are offered this opportunity. The program has consistently received very strong evaluation and our past alumni have become brand ambassadors and advocates for our program. We plan to build on the success and legacy of this program in the next three year funding cycle of this grant (2019-2021). The overarching goal of our summer institute in big data is to recruit and train the next generation of big data scientists using a non-traditional, action-based learning paradigm. This six week long summer institute will recruit a group of approximately 45 undergraduates nationally and internationally, with 20 domestic students supported by the requested SIBS funding mechanism and others supported by supplementary institutional and foundation support. We propose to expose the trainees to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of health Big Data. They will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. They will engage in mentored research projects in three primary areas of health big data: Electronic Health Records/Medical Claims, Genomics and Imaging. Some of the projects will be defined in the area of cardiovascular precision medicine, defined by a team of highly quantitative researchers engaged in cardiovascular research that uses big data. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by U-M researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate school. We propose an inter-SIBS collaboration with Dordt College summer program trainees who will attend this concluding symposium. The resources developed for the summer institute, including lectures, assignments, projects, template codes and datasets will be freely available through a wiki page so that this format can be replicated anywhere in the world. This democratic dissemination plan will lead to access of teaching and training material for undergraduate students in this new field across the world. We will offer multiple professional development opportunities and resources for graduate school preparation to our trainees so that they can reflect and plan beyond their senior year. All of our proposed activities are reflected through our three specific aims: Teaching, Mentoring and Dissemination. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose a six week long undergraduate summer institute: “Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data” to be held at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan (U-M), Ann Arbor, with a group of approximately 45 undergraduate students recruited nationally and internationally, from 2019-2021. Funding is requested for 20 domestic students with supplementary funding expected to be garnered through institutional resources and private foundation support. The program builds on the success of our existing Big Data Summer Institute (BDSI) supported by a NIH BD2K Courses and Skills grant award that is ending in 2018. We plan to expose program students to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of Big Data and Human Health. We enhance our ongoing summer program structure in the current proposal by involving a team of researchers working at the intersection of cardiovascular research and data science with a focus on cardiovascular precision medicine where some of the new mentored research projects will be defined. We primarily focus on three genres of health Big Data arising in Electronic Health Records/Medical Claims, Genomics and Imaging. The trainees will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty from Biostatistics, Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, Statistics, Computer Science and Engineering, Information Sciences, Epidemiology and Medicine, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by (U-M) researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate school. The resources developed for the summer institute, including lectures, assignments, projects, template codes and datasets will be freely available through a Wiki page so that this format can be replicated anywhere in the world. This democratic dissemination plan will lead to access of teaching and training material in this new field across the world.

"Training the next generation of leaders in biomedical engineering design Project Summary/Abstract The next generation of bioengineering and biomedical researchers will have unprecedented access to technologies including wireless health, big data, genetic sequencing, and machine learning approaches to enable modern diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. This presents individuals trained at the interface of technology and biomedicine with an enormous opportunity to address the world’s needs in health and medicine. In the Bioengineering Department at the University of California, Los Angeles, we aim to develop students into leaders able to seamlessly identify clinical needs that technology can address, design and validate solutions that address these needs, communicate with a variety of stakeholders to build teams invested in problem-oriented solutions, and to navigate the regulatory and commercial pathways necessary to enable their technologies to thrive. The Bioengineering Capstone Series at UCLA leverages resources available at UCLA to enable students to: 1) gain insight into clinical needs directly from clinicians and educators across the Ronald Reagan Medical Center, David Geffen School of Medicine, School of Dentistry and UCLA Health System, 2) design their solutions through mentorship from engineering professors, 3) understand the complexities of the biomedical industry with support from the UCLA Technology Development Group and members of the Department of Engineering Industry Advisory Board, 4) utilize modern technologies in wireless health and data science by collaborating with the Center of Excellence for Mobile Sensor Data- to-Knowledge (MD2K) and Mobile Health (mHealth) Institute at UCLA, and 5) work with the National Science Foundation Precise Advanced Technologies and Health Systems for Underserved Populations Engineering Research Center (NSF PATHS- UP ERC) to learn to target and communicate their technologies to maximize societal benefits. Statement of Public Health Relevance: To prepare the next generation of engineers with skills in the design of therapeutics and medical devices, this research education program will provide bioengineering students at UCLA with enhanced opportunities to engage in real world design for biomedical applications. We will guide students through the medical design process from identifying needs, creating solutions which address these needs, and communicating the significance of their contributions to the greater community, ultimately yielding a larger pool of well-trained engineers to address biomedical challenges. !",Training the next generation of leaders in biomedical engineering design,10142466,R25EB027626,"['Address', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Technology', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'High School Student', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Intellectual Property', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Modernization', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'STEM field', 'School Dentistry', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'Underrepresented Students', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinically actionable', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'education research', 'engineering design', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'lectures', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'outreach', 'product development', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'skills', 'technology development', 'undergraduate student', 'underserved community']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R25,2021,21600
"Clinical Research Education in Genome Science (CREiGS) Project Summary/Abstract  The sensitivity and availability of omic technologies have enabled the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic characterization of disease phenotypes, at the tissue and even the single cell level. This has allowed development of treatments that target specific disease subtypes, most notably in cancer treatment, and thus opened up opportunities for the development of precision/personalized medicine strategies for optimizing treatments for individual patients. Thus, new genomic science educational initiatives need to be continually updated to educate the clinical and translational workforce on how to effectively interpret and apply the findings from genomics studies. Patients of providers who have participated in these educational initiatives also benefit as it allows for more rapid integration of genomic study findings into the clinical care setting. Thus, in response to PAR-19-185, we propose to develop and implement the Clinical Research Education in Genome Science (CREiGS) program that will not only focus on the analysis of genomic data, but also on gene-expression data, the integration of these two data types, as well as introductory theory and application of statistical and machine learning methods. Specifically we propose to accomplish the following specific aims: 1. Develop and successfully implement the online and in-person phases of CREiGS to increase the methodologic ingenuity by which researchers tackle important genomics-related clinical problems. 2. Establish a Diversity Recruitment External Advisory Board to ensure that the most effective strategies are employed to recruit URM doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty from academic institutions nationwide into CREiGS. 3. Enhance the dissemination phase of CREiGS by packaging and uploading the asynchronous lectures and the online critical thinking/problem solving assessments with solutions for publicly available, online teaching resources. 4. Implement effective methods to evaluate the efficacy of CREiGS by examining:1) the participants' grasp of the CREiGS core competencies, 2) the clarity and quality of the curriculum, 3) program logistics and operation, and 4) the participants' short-term and long-term success attributed to participation in CREiGS. In summary, we posit that CREiGS will provide participants with a solid foundation in genomics science to answer complex, clinical questions. We believe that CREiGS supports the mission of the NHGRI by providing researchers with rigorous training to “accelerate medical breakthroughs that improve human health.” Project Narrative The sensitivity and availability of omic technologies have allowed for the development of treatments that target specific disease subtypes, most notably in cancer treatment, and thus opened up opportunities for the development of precision/personalized medicine strategies for optimizing treatments for individual patients.

"Advanced Training at the Interface of Engineering and Oral-Craniofacial Sciences Contact PD/PI: KOO, HYUN Oral diseases and disorders in the craniofacial complex disproportionally and devastatingly afflict susceptible populations, particularly impoverished families and medically or physically compromised persons. Novel engineering approaches, properly leveraged, can yield new paradigms to reveal disease mechanism, new strategies for disease mitigation, and new approaches for affordable/personalized therapies for dental caries, periodontal diseases, and oral cancer. To achieve this vision, academic research bound dentist-scientists must be adept in engineering concepts and engineers must be educated in oral and craniofacial sciences and needs; all must be aware of the complex clinical and regulatory landscapes. To address this urgent need, we propose a multidisciplinary training program in Penn’s School of Dental Medicine (PDM) and School of Engineering & Applied Sciences (SEAS) focused on training dentist-scientists and engineers for academic careers dedicated to research in precision oral health and healthcare innovation. Postdoctoral trainees will adopt cutting-edge approaches at the forefront of engineering and computational sciences to advance the fields of oral biofilm microbiome, host immunity and tissue regeneration, drawing on approaches including artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, and materials sciences, aware of developmental hurdles and requirements to safely bring new approaches to patients. Trainees will engage in interactive and tailored academic experiences with intensive mentored research via co-mentoring (one advisor from each school), and interaction with a career mentoring committee (CMC) that includes at least one dental clinician. Co-mentors and CMC members will be drawn from the Program Faculty of 26 faculty in PDM and SEAS with significant records of mentorship of multidisciplinary and translational research. Training will include: (1) engineering fundamentals for dental trainees and oral & craniofacial biology principles for engineering trainees, tailored to match their research project and academic needs, (2) clinical research and regulatory affairs, (3) principles of scientific rigor and reproducibility, (4) scientific writing and (5) workshops on professional and career development. Trainees will engage in academic and industry interactions, journal club, give symposia presentations, and participate in AADR/IADR activities. Training will culminate in F/K award applications focused on advancing oral health at the dental-engineering interface. The applicant pool at the University of Pennsylvania is exceptionally strong and diverse, and we anticipate being able to attract outstanding candidates. Furthermore, via partnerships with ADA, AADR/IADR and minority-serving dental schools, we will diversify our candidate pool. We plan to enroll 4 trainees per year. Importantly, this effort will be an element of a newly formed inter-school center between PDM and SEAS with shared funding. The proposed program, unique to Penn, leverages a superb research and training environment within a compact campus where resources for both schools are united through Penn’s new Center for Innovation and Precision Dentistry. Project Summary/Abstract Page 6 Contact PD/PI: KOO, HYUN Advances in engineering approaches offer previously unimagined opportunities to advance the NIDCR 2030 vision of precision oral health for all. To harness this opportunity, a critical mass of cross-trained dentists and engineers engaged in oral and craniofacial research are urgently needed. We will develop this workforce.

"Institutional Career Development Core The KL2 Mentored Clinical Scholars Program attracts a diverse group of highly talented junior faculty across multiple disciplines from across Yale University (Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Applied Science) who will pursue careers in T1-T4 translational research. This Program has been extremely successful, attracting 151 Scholars who have authored >5200 publications, have been PIs on 258 NIH grants, and have received a total of $557 million in grant funding. Remarkably, 99% of our KL2 Scholars have attained positions in academia, industry or public health conducting, and often with leadership responsibilities for, clinical and translational research. We aim to build on this success by providing Scholars with individualized, competency-based training in translational research that prepares them to contribute to the learning healthcare system, to advance personalized health, and to address health disparities. This preparation includes training in clinical trials, big data, machine learning, bioinformatics, multidisciplinary translational research, team science, implementation science and community-based participatory research. It also introduces them to regulatory issues, bioethics, Good Clinical Practices, and factors that drive rigor, transparency, and replicability. The KL2 promotes the development of relevant competencies among the Scholars by providing: 1) opportunities to work successfully in complex and diverse multidisciplinary research teams, 2) access to mentorship by senior mentors and recent Clinical Scholars, 3) externships in industry, public health and regulatory agencies, and 4) intensive training in grant-writing and in multidisciplinary team science. To oversee these diverse, highly motivated junior investigators, we have an educational leadership team of: 1) three outstanding investigator mentors who work in different areas of translational research, 2) an experienced Diversity Officer, and 3) an expert in evaluating and dynamically reshaping medical education programs. This leadership team has used feedback from prior Scholars and their mentors to add new initiatives to the already successful program. We expanded our logic model to implement social network analyses to track the activities of the Scholars, and we will expand the curriculum to include a new course. That course will mix Scholars and TL-1 trainees who will work in teams as they get formal training and peer mentoring in a variety of areas such as big data/machine learning, diversity and inclusion, and running a research laboratory. With these additions to an already strong curriculum, we believe that the Yale Mentored Clinical Scholars Program will be ideally positioned to train the next generation of leaders in T1-T4 translational research who will transform healthcare in ways that alleviate the burden of disease and improve health in the US and around the world. The Specific Aims of the KL2 are: Aim 1: The Yale Mentored Clinical Scholars Program: To provide a program comprised of a mentored research experience, coursework, and seminars that are intended to promote the emergence of scientific independence and the career development of talented young T1-T4 translational scientist Scholars. Aim 2: The Yale Masters in Health Science Program: To provide those M.D. Scholars who do not possess an advanced research degree with additional coursework and scholarly activities to qualify for a Masters in Health Science (MHS) to address limitations in their scientific preparation for a research career. n/a",Institutional Career Development Core,10368487,KL2TR001862,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Big Data', 'Bioethics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Good Clinical Practice', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratory Research', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Education', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Science', 'Social Network', 'Talents', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'community based participatory research', 'experience', 'externship', 'health disparity', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'peer coaching', 'programs', 'success', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,YALE UNIVERSITY,KL2,2021,1318718
