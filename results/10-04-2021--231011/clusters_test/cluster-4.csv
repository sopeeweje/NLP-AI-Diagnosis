"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation. Our planned experiments include a closed-loop stimulation paradigm seeking to use parietal stimulation to improve memory performance, the results of which will both inform theories of human episodic memory processing and of the design of therapeutic brain stimulation devices to treat cognitive deficits.",Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory,10348398,R01NS107357,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Animal Experiments', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Episodic memory', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analog', 'base', 'design', 'direct application', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'human imaging', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'memory recognition', 'memory retrieval', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'recruit', 'success', 'theories']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,79818
"Neural markers of impending task performance PROJECT ABSTRACT The neural mechanisms underlying successful cognitive performance are not well understood. In this R03 project, we will thoroughly investigate the ability to predict behavioral improvements through changes in shared underlying neural mechanisms. Identifying neural metrics that predict individual performance gains will ensure more reliable behavioral outcomes across diverse populations with varying cognitive capabilities and age ranges. Additionally, understanding the neural mechanisms underlying successful cognition will allow for rescuing of lost cognitive abilities and prophylaxis of cognitive decline in aging and other vulnerable populations such as in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We recently identified several signals in the electroencephalogram (EEG) that correlated with cognitive performance improvements following and intervention with cognitive training and/or noninvasive neurostimulation. Specifically, frontal midline power in the theta band (4-8 Hz) correlates with improved divided attention ability and transfer to improved sustained attention ability in older adults (Anguera et al., 2013), and frontoparietal connectivity in the theta band is linked to improved attention (Anguera et al., 2013) and working memory (Jones et al., 2017). In addition to band- limited theta, we found that cross-frequency coupling between frontal theta oscillations and temporo-parietal gamma (>30 Hz) activity tracked individual performance gains in working memory following intervention with training and neurostimulation (Jones et al., 2020). These findings suggest that theta oscillations, as measured by power, connectivity, and cross-frequency coupling in task-relevant regions, underlie individual differences in cognitive performance. Indeed, the application of noninvasive neurostimulation confirmed the critical role of theta oscillations in divided attention by showing that direct entrainment of frontal theta oscillations further enhanced performance (Hsu et al., 2017, 2018). The proposed research will determine the mechanisms by which theta oscillations, assessed at baseline, predict subsequent cognitive performance outcomes in aging and vulnerable populations. Critically, we identified preliminary evidence that an individual's intrinsic peak theta frequency predicted the efficacy of theta entrainment with neurostimulation on divided attention ability. This important preliminary result demonstrates that a nuanced approach to tailoring an intervention to the individual is feasible. Here, our analyses seek to predict subsequent performance during divided attention prior to intervention (Aim 1) and before trial onset in a range of cognitive tasks (Aim 2). We will conduct comprehensive regularized multiple regression and deep learning analyses on 13 existing EEG datasets, several of which share the same divided attention task, yet vary in participant demographics, including age and cognitive capability (healthy older and younger adults, multi-domain amnestic MCI patients), to develop a predictive model for an individually-tailored cognitive intervention. The results will inform future research that seeks to maximize the reliability of intervention protocols across demographics at any age or cognitive capability. PROJECT NARRATIVE This grant proposal seeks to elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms responsible for behavioral improvement through novel secondary analyses on a variety of cognitive tasks (divided attention, working memory, perceptual discrimination) and participants that range from healthy younger adults, healthy older adults, and multi-domain amnestic mild cognitive impairment. The goal will be to fit identified oscillatory neural metrics within a model that can predict cognitive performance through the use of advanced EEG and deep learning analyses. This predictive model will be of public health importance as the outcome will allow for tailoring of cognitive prophylaxis, rehabilitation, and interventions in healthy, at-risk, and in clinical populations.",Neural markers of impending task performance,10218883,R03AG065966,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Applications Grants', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Ensure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'age related', 'aging population', 'amnestic mild cognitive impairment', 'baby boomer', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive load', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive training', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'demographics', 'executive function', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'rehabilitation paradigm', 'relating to nervous system', 'secondary analysis', 'sustained attention', 'targeted biomarker', 'targeted treatment', 'young adult']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2021,161500
"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation Project Summary/Abstract One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign—yet annoying—examples of ‘normal’ forgetting, it is also a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have emphasized the critical role of pattern separation in reducing memory interference. Pattern separation involves coding similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for confusion is thereby minimized. While there is general agreement that pattern separation is implemented by the hippocampus—and that pattern separation is important for reducing memory interference—there remain several fundamental gaps in our understanding of how, when, and why pattern separation occurs. In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity—that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation—to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining. Project Narrative A primary reason we forget is because we store a vast number of memories and interference between these memories becomes inevitable. While forgetting may only represent an occasional annoyance for most people, among older adults and those with dementia—groups that are growing at a disproportionate rate— memory confusion and interference-related forgetting can be debilitating problems. The proposed research seeks to identify neural mechanisms that reduce interference-related forgetting, including in younger and older adults, and will lead to fundamental new insight into how the brain resolves interference between similar memories.",Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation,10123856,R01NS089729,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory Disorders', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'age related', 'clinically significant', 'data mining', 'dentate gyrus', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'forgetting', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'insight', 'motivated behavior', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2021,485965
"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury,10062524,R01NS102646,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attentional deficit', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Variant', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'personalized predictions', 'prognostic', 'recruit', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tractography', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,553209
"Tracking the dynamics of how schemas scaffold recall Project Summary Every new experience in our life takes place within the context of familiar environments and situations. However, most research on memory has focused on the artificial memorization of word lists, symbols or pictures; these studies do not meaningfully address how structured prior knowledge about the world (e.g., in the form of a familiar spatial map, or knowledge of how restaurant meals unfold over time) can scaffold new learning. In the proposed studies, I aim to precisely characterize how and where prior knowledge and new information are represented, how they get linked at encoding, and how they interact at recall to allow memories to be retrieved. In the first proposed study of my F99 phase, I test the hypothesis that hippocampal engagement at event boundaries during learning binds new information (i.e. objects) to the scaffold of existing knowledge (i.e. knowledge of a familiar location), and that hippocampal activation during recall mediates the successful retrieval of the bound object from the location in which it was stored. I also test the hypothesis that distinctive representations of spatial locations in the brain will reduce interference between objects stored in those locations. There is a potential downside to using prior knowledge as a scaffold: When there is too much information attached to one part of the scaffold, old and new memories will interfere with each other. How, then, could someone prioritize the retrieval of new memories over older (now-irrelevant) memories that were linked to the scaffold? Recent research on intentional forgetting suggests a solution to this limitation. Specifically, in my second proposed study, I test the hypothesis (supported by neurophysiological evidence, prior neuroimaging results, and computational models) that previously encoded memories can be weakened by moderately activating their neural representation, thereby “cleaning” the scaffold and reducing interference. In the K00 phase, I will extend my research to identify pathologies in how clinical populations use prior knowledge to interpret and remember their experiences, using tools from computational psychiatry; I also plan to design new technological tools to address these issues. Overall, the proposed project makes use of naturalistic and ecologically valid stimuli (in the form of continuous stimuli and immersive virtual reality) paired with advanced machine learning tools applied to brain imaging data, to study the fundamental nature of how new and old information are linked to allow learning. In the long-term, the findings from this project regarding how prior knowledge can be optimally leveraged to support new learning will lead to the development of tools to help memory-impaired individuals make better use of prior knowledge to support new learning, as well as remedies for groups where deficiencies in prior knowledge prevent them from learning properly. Project Narrative In my dissertation, I will use newly-developed machine learning techniques to study how the brain uses prior knowledge (about the spatial structure of an environment, or how certain types of events unfold in time) to scaffold new learning. By precisely characterizing how this scaffolding process works, my research will help to identify ways in which prior knowledge can be more optimally leveraged to support learning. This will lead to the development of tools to help memory-impaired individuals make better use of intact prior knowledge to support new learning, as well as remedies for groups where deficiencies in prior knowledge prevent them from learning properly.",Tracking the dynamics of how schemas scaffold recall,10156352,F99NS120644,"['Address', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Restaurants', 'Retrieval', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'field study', 'forgetting', 'memory encoding', 'memory retrieval', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'phase 1 testing', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'scaffold', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment', 'virtual world']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F99,2021,47036
"Causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention PROPOSAL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sustained attention – the continuous allocation of cognitive resources to respond to infrequent but behaviorally relevant stimuli – is impaired in many psychiatric disorders and represents an important aspect of cognitive control. Sustained attention requires top-down control and engagement with the external world, which is linked to both frontoparietal and thalamic controlling signals on primary sensor cortices. Despite the extensive behavioral characterization of sustained attention in animal models using the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), very little is known about the oscillatory interaction between the dorsal attention network and thalamo-cortical dynamics and its potential as a stimulation target for enhancing sustained attention. The objective of this project is to dissect the causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention via temporally-precise rhythmic stimulation. I will focus on three regions in the visual thalamo-cortical network: higher-order visual thalamus (lateral aspect of lateral posterior nucleus, LPl), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and primary visual cortex (V1). I will test the central hypothesis that LPl-cortical theta (4-7 Hz) functional connectivity causally coordinates PPC-V1 functional connectivity to facilitate sustained attention. The rationale of this work is that the proposed temporally-precise rhythmic optogenetic perturbations will directly test the causal role of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in sustained attention. Accordingly, the two specific aims are: (1) Delineate the functional role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention, (2) Determine the causal role of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in sustained attention via temporally-precise rhythmic optogenetics. This work is significant because it will causally test a convergent model in which higher-order visual thalamus coordinates the parietal top-down control signals onto visual cortex that is crucial for developing circuit- based therapies to enhance sustained attention. The work is innovative due to its integration of closed-loop optogenetics circuit interrogation, multisite electrophysiology, freely-moving sustained attention task, and machine-learning tools for the investigation of the causal role of oscillatory synchronization. The overall positive impact of the proposed study is to provide a more comprehensive map of how the higher-order visual thalamus interacts with the frontoparietal control signal to modulate V1, and thus mediates sustained attention, a transdiagnostic cognitive function that shows impairment in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. The implication of this study is that it may reveal a general mechanism underlying the interaction between two higher-order processing structures signaling to lower sensory cortices during cognitive processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sustained attention enables us to focus our cognitive resources on an activity for a prolonged period of time, and when impaired causes profound deficits in both cognition and behavior. Sustained attention is modulated by the thalamo-cortical rhythms. The research generated in this proposal will investigate (1) what oscillatory feature in the higher-order thalamo-cortical circuit is crucial for sustained attention, and (2) how the temporally- precise enhancing or disrupting of a thalamo-cortical oscillatory feature alters the functional connectivity in the circuit and behavioral outcomes mediated by sustained attention.",Causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention,10199754,F31MH118799,"['Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Exhibits', 'Ferrets', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Impulsivity', 'Investigation', 'Lasers', 'Lateral', 'Lateral posterior nucleus of thalamus', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'area striata', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'functional disability', 'innovation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'sensory cortex', 'signal processing', 'sustained attention', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2021,40048
"Optimizing sleep spindle measurements as translational assays of memory consolidation This research proposal addresses a key challenge to drug development: the paucity of biomarkers that reveal whether interventions affect implicated brain circuitry at early stages, in animals and humans, before embarking on lengthy and expensive clinical trials. Studies of humans and rodents have established sleep spindles, defining EEG oscillations of stage 2 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, as a mechanism of memory consolidation. A growing body of work implicates sleep spindle abnormalities in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders characterized by memory impairment. In schizophrenia, sleep spindle deficits predict impaired sleep- dependent memory consolidation. Findings that increasing spindles via drugs or auditory or transcranial brain stimulation during sleep improves memory in healthy people, provides the impetus to target spindles to improve memory in disorders. But targeting spindles does not inevitably improve memory. Complementary rodent and human studies provide an explanation: sleep-dependent memory consolidation relies not on spindles alone, but on their precise temporal coordination with the other two cardinal NREM sleep oscillations: cortical slow oscillations (SOs) and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. These findings make it clear that while spindles are promising targets for improving memory, (i) effective therapies need to increase spindles AND preserve or enhance their coupling with SOs and ripples, and (ii) to evaluate efficacy, we need new assays to identify spindles that couple with SOs and ripples to mediate memory versus those that do not. We propose to: (i) identify the most powerful translational measures of sleep spindles as assays of sleep-dependent memory consolidation (UG3), and (ii) to noninvasively manipulate them to compare their responses in healthy humans and rodents (UH3). Using invasive recordings in epilepsy patients and local field potentials (LFPs) in rats, we will first demonstrate that spindles that couple with both SOs and ripples (TriCS: triple-coupled spindles) are associated with memory consolidation, thereby validating TriCS as a translational biomarker of memory. We will then use machine learning to develop a classifier that identifies TriCS based solely on their scalp EEG features. We will validate the EEG spindle classifier by applying it to a dataset from healthy humans to demonstrate that TriCS, but not non-coupled spindles, correlate with memory consolidation. In both species, we will determine which spindle assay TriCS, SO-coupled spindles (SOCS) or total spindles predicts memory best. Finally, we will noninvasively manipulate the spindle assays in humans and rats. Genetic studies are implicating specific pathophysiologic mechanisms of spindle deficits in schizophrenia and autism and identifying novel targets and treatments. The rodent and human spindle assays that we will develop will facilitate the translation of these advances to the clinic by allowing the efficient evaluation of potential interventions early in the treatment development pipeline and the identification of the most promising candidates for clinical trials. A fundamental challenge to finding effective treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders is the paucity of biomarkers that can gauge whether a potential intervention affects abnormal circuitry early in the treatment development pipeline, before embarking on expensive and lengthy clinical trials. This research proposal will develop novel physiological assays of sleep-dependent memory consolidation in humans and rodents that can be used to predict the efficacy of newly emerging treatments. These assays will enable the efficient screening and identification of treatments that can alleviate highly disabling cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",Optimizing sleep spindle measurements as translational assays of memory consolidation,10112344,UG3MH125273,"['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Eszopiclone', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Polysomnography', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rodent', 'Scalp structure', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'clinical candidate', 'density', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy evaluation', 'improved', 'memory consolidation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'preservation', 'response', 'screening', 'sleep spindle', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,UG3,2021,734247
"Cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by heterochronic blood exchange PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  Aging-induced cerebromicrovascular endothelial dysfunction is the primary factor in impairment of neurovascular coupling (NVC) responses and dysregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), contributing to the genesis of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Heterochronic blood exchange (HBE) in mice as well as bioassay experiments in cultured endothelial cells treated with sera from human patients, non-human primates and rodent models of aging provide compelling evidence that implicates non-cell autonomous mechanisms as key drivers of endothelial aging processes. Guided by analysis of vascular transcriptomic changes in heterochronic parabiont mice the objective of the proposal is to elucidate the mechanism of cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation activated by specific circulating anti-geronic factors present in young blood. The central hypothesis is that young blood rescues the age-related decline in signaling via the NAD+/SIRT1 axis and reverses circulating IGF-1 deficiency, each of which can result in vascular mitochondrial rejuvenation, attenuation of endothelial oxidative stress, improved endothelial vasodilator function and restoration of endothelial angiogenic processes. The resulting increases in CBF and NVC responses reduce ischemic loci, promoting brain health. The following aims are proposed: 1) Determine the role of the cerebromicrovascular NAD+ /SIRT1 axis in rejuvenation by HBE. The working hypothesis is that HBE rescues the age-related decline in NAD+, which rejuvenates cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells via a SIRT1-dependent pathway. It is predicted that disruption of the NAD+ /SIRT1 axis will prevent cerebrovascular rejuvenation by HBE in aged mice. 2) Determine the role of circulating IGF-1 in cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by HBE. The working hypothesis is that HBE reverses age-related IGF-1 deficiency, which exerts multifaceted endothelial protective effects contributing to cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by young blood. It is predicted that HBE-mediated endothelial functional and transcriptomic changes are partially prevented by disruption of IGF-1/IGFR1 signaling. 3) Determine how circulating NAD precursors and IGF-1 in young and old humans determine cerebromicrovascular endothelial function and phenotype. This will be tested by bioassaying the effects of circulating factors and integrating the results with existing endothelial function, NVC and CBF data from the serum donors. To optimize cognitive status prediction with automated machine learning we will perform association analyses of endothelial signatures with cerebrovascular and cognitive measures using linear mixed effect models. Together, the proposed studies will elucidate the involvement of two key mechanisms in the protective effects of HBE against cerebromicrovascular aging and the pathogenesis of VCID. NARRATIVE The human brain is supplied by a dense array of vessels where each neuron has its supplying capillary. Aging impairs functionally and structurally the cerebromicrovasculature and thus induces consequential neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Our recent studies using heterochronic blood exchange (HBE) in mice showed that young blood rescues the age-related decline in signaling via the NAD+/SIRT1 axis and reverses circulating IGF-1 deficiency, each of which can result in vascular mitochondrial rejuvenation, attenuation of endothelial oxidative stress, improved endothelial vasodilator function and restoration of endothelial angiogenic processes, improving brain health.",Cerebromicrovascular rejuvenation by heterochronic blood exchange,10208361,RF1AG072295,"['Abbreviations', 'Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Attenuated', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Enzymes', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hyperemia', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Nutrient', 'Oklahoma', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen', 'Parabiosis', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Rejuvenation', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'SIRT1 gene', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Vasodilation', 'Vasodilator Agents', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'attenuation', 'base', 'brain health', 'cerebrovascular', 'cognitive function', 'cost estimate', 'density', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'functional disability', 'healthy aging', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'improved', 'neurovascular', 'neurovascular coupling', 'nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'older patient', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'response', 'restoration', 'transcriptomics', 'vascular cognitive impairment and dementia']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,RF1,2021,1361358
"Layer-specific encoding of working memory in an automated 8-arm radial maze PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Working memory (WM), the cognitive entity that allows for temporary storage and manipulation of informa- tion, is crucial for much of what gives life subjective meaning, and enables an individual to participate in larger society. This includes following a conversation, finding a supermarket item, planning, driving, learning new skills—most anything that requires holding in mind information from long-term memory and/or sensory input for use requires WM. As a result, WM dysfunction has devastating effects, and regrettably, millions—individuals with schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, dementia, and more—experience varying degrees of WM impairment, which is almost totally treatment resistant. Given its role in neurocognitive health and disease, understanding the mechanisms of WM is imperative. Correspondingly, this project will explore in depth the circuit basis for WM.  The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be a primary orchestrator of WM, processing input from other brain regions for WM instantiation. In spatial working memory (SWM), a WM subdomain regularly studied across species, interactions of the PFC with the ventral hippocampus and mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) are considered essential, with PFC-MD interactions undergirding neural maintenance of WM content and subsequent action selection. Notably, the PFC is quite heterogeneous, being composed of layers that differ both in their cellular composition and in their connectivity. Yet the possibility that these laminar subregions might uniquely contribute to the multifaceted ways in which the PFC empowers WM is only now being explored: recent studies suggest that superficial PFC layers support WM content maintenance, while deep PFC layers support post-maintenance action selection. This proposal expands upon these studies by using novel technology to explore cellular-resolution laminar representations in WM.  Specifically, this proposal examines what WM content is encoded in the activity of individual cells vs. popula- tions in the different PFC layers (Aim 1) and assesses the dependence of these laminar WM representations on input from the MD (Aim 2). To do so, calcium imaging will be performed through microendoscopes in mice genetically and surgically specified to express calcium indicators in particular PFC layers. These mice will perform a trial-based delayed nonmatch to sample WM task in a custom-built, automated 8-armed radial maze, and for Aim 2 will have MD input to the PFC optogenetically silenced during behavior and imaging (to simulate the MD-PFC hypoconnectivity regularly observed in those with WM deficits). Finally, for rigorous mapping of behavior to neural activity, novel machine learning behavioral classification paradigms will be used.  WM provides the cognitive building blocks for the very fabric of quotidian life—sustaining social relationships, maintaining a job, living independently, learning new things and more. Given such complexity, detailed interrogation of WM circuit mechanisms is required. Accordingly, this proposal uses emerging technologies to explore circuit mechanisms of both WM function and dysfunction, advancing pursuits of therapeutic innovation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Working memory, the cognitive entity through which information can be temporarily held in mind for processing, is fundamental to many essential human activities, from holding a conversation, to walking home from the bus stop, to introspecting. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has long been known to undergird working memory, with information maintenance empowered by input from the mediodorsal thalamus (MD), but how the different PFC layers support this complex and versatile capability remains largely unclear. This proposal will assess the neural representations in PFC layers during spatial working memory, and how they depend on MD input, to better establish circuit mechanisms for working memory instantiation, to the end of moving us closer to eventual therapies for the millions affected by working memory impairment.",Layer-specific encoding of working memory in an automated 8-arm radial maze,10198670,F31MH124323,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Critical Thinking', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Genotype', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home environment', 'Human Activities', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Medial', 'Medial Dorsal Nucleus', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Mind', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opsin', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Radial', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Supermarket', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Textiles', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'arm', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cellular imaging', 'cost', 'empowered', 'experience', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'lens', 'long term memory', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'microendoscope', 'new technology', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'self-directed learning', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'social relationships', 'theories']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2021,46036
"Patient-Centered Serious Games for Remote Cognitive Training in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment Project Summary/Abstract Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is characterized by cognitive decline greater than expected from normal aging, which does not yet significantly interfere with the performance of activities of daily living. The therapeutic goal for MCI is to slow down the course of the disease progress and reduce the impact of clinical symptoms. There has also been a particular emphasis on non-pharmacological interventions because they can slow disease progression and are low cost, non-invasive, safe, and have no adverse side effects. Serious games have received great interests among researchers and clinicians as a promising, low-cost, non- pharmacological intervention tool that can help assess and train patients’ cognitive function in a variety of environments (e.g., in/outside the clinic). Serious games in healthcare represent digital applications focusing on educating, informing, and enhancing patients’ health by leveraging the entertainment components of video games. However, currently available solutions require substantial involvement of trained caregivers and clinicians to motivate patients to adhere to the intervention protocol, which acts as the key barrier to the widespread implementations of serious game-based interventions. To bridge these gaps, this project aims to develop a mobile-health (mHealth) technology designed to encourage the use of, and thereby maximizing the compliance to, serious game-based training in individuals with MCI outside the clinic. We plan to employ a tablet-based application – namely Neuro-World – composed of six serious games designed to stimulate working memory and selective attention, which is developed by our research team’s industrial partner. Fully leveraging the system’s ability to provide clinically meaningful insights related to patients’ cognitive performance from their gameplays, their progress over time, and their compliance behaviors (e.g., use frequency and duration), it is our ultimate research goal to develop an optimal, human-centered serious game platform that can motivate patients’ to better adhere to the technological regimen. To accomplish this research goal, Aim 1 will focus on evaluating the preliminary efficacy of our serious games as a training tool to improve cognitive function. We will perform a small single-blind randomized controlled trial in 50 individuals with MCI who will be randomized either to the intervention group or the control group. In Aim 2, we will develop machine learning-based algorithms to derive clinically meaningful information regarding cognitive function from the game performance. Aim 3 will finally investigate the optimal design of the mHealth system to maximize patients’ compliance with serious game-based training via human-centered design approaches. We believe that outcomes of this project will open a new door leading to previously unexplored datasets and understanding of patient-technology interactions to promote positive behavior changes to enable self- administered, serious game-based cognitive training, which can form the basis of a wide range of future investigations of hemiparesis rehabilitation and personalized disease management. Project Narrative Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is characterized by cognitive decline greater than expected from normal aging. Serious games have received great interests from researchers and clinicians as a promising, low-cost, non- pharmacological intervention tool that can complement the conventional therapeutic programs to help assess and rehabilitate patients' functional impairments in many environments (e.g., clinics, long-term care facilities, patients' homes). In this project, we propose to develop a human-centered mobile-health (mHealth) technology designed to encourage the self-administrate serious game-based training in patients with MCI outside the clinic.",Patient-Centered Serious Games for Remote Cognitive Training in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment,10190616,R21AG071988,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Self Administration', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Single-Blind Study', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Video Games', 'base', 'behavior change', 'caregiver education', 'chronic stroke', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical outcome measures', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive training', 'community setting', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'functional disability', 'group intervention', 'hemiparesis', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'mHealth', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'patient engagement', 'patient oriented', 'personalized management', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychological distress', 'recruit', 'rural area', 'selective attention', 'side effect', 'stroke survivor', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'treatment as usual', 'underserved area', 'usability']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R21,2021,436836
"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD,10187663,R01NS100849,"['Acetylcholine', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Dementia with Lewy Bodies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction Time', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Time', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'alpha synuclein', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive impairment in Parkinson&apos', 's', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'implantation', 'improved', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motor symptom', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,75097
"Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging. Age-related cognitive decline is a problem of growing importance given the trend toward increased lifespan and the importance of cognitive function in determining risk for neurodegenerative disease. Despite the importance of this problem, the cognitive and molecular changes that mediate it are still poorly understood. While there are competing theories for the mediators of cognitive aging at both psychological and molecular levels, theories on aging and the research supporting them have typically focused on a single level of analysis. As our understanding of the biological basis for behavior grows, this divide becomes less sensible. Instead, psychological theory should be constrained according to its known biology, and biology should in turn inform psychological theory. Here I propose to learn neural network modeling and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques in order to bridge human psychological theory that has been the focus of my recent work to the molecular level theory that was the focus of my post-baccalaureate training at the NIA. I will build from my recent work that highlights a key statistical problem faced by the brain: how to selectively pool information across relevant sources but partition information across irrelevant ones. I will closely examine the cognitive and molecular mechanisms that allow for efficient pooling and partitioning to test the overarching theory that, due to impaired glutamate and dopamine signaling, older adults develop a selective deficit in pooling relevant sources of information. I will test this theory in two separate paradigms: visual working memory (K99) and learning and perceptual inference (R00). During the K99 phase of the award I will examine how pooling information from visual targets with similar features can 1) improve effective memory capacity, 2) be achieved by a neural network model, and 3) be impaired by simulated molecular deficiencies (glutamate, dopamine, norepinephrine). This bridge between cognitive and molecular levels of analysis will be used to test whether age-related memory deficits are due to inefficient pooling and mediated by molecular deficits in glutamate and dopamine (as measured through MRS and behavioral proxy, respectively). During the R00 phase of the award I will use the training in neural networks and MRS provided in the K99 phase to examine how 1) pooling sequential pieces of information affects learning and perceptual bias, 2) efficient pooling and partitioning can be achieved by a neural network model and 3) these processes are disrupted by specific molecular deficiencies. The established relationships between statistical properties (sequential pooling and partitioning), psychological measurements (learning and perceptual bias) and molecular factors (glutamate, dopamine, and norepinephrine signaling levels) will be used to test whether age-related differences in learning and perceptual bias reflect deficient pooling mediated by local glutamate deficiency (as measured through MRS). Overall, this work will contribute a deeper and more detailed understanding of the psychological and molecular factors that interact to mediate age-related cognitive decline. In addition, the K99 training will provide me the tools necessary to link psychological and molecular levels of analysis and the R00 phase will build the foundations of my independent research laboratory allowing me to develop a successful scientific career driven by experiments that build and refine a unified understanding of cognitive aging. Project Narrative This project will explore how changes to basic information processing in the brain occurring over the course of healthy aging may contribute to age-related deficits in learning and memory. The work will also examine the biological underpinnings of these changes and may inform future research into interventions that could slow the cognitive aging process.",Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging.,10171740,R00AG054732,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Arousal', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Comparative Study', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Dopamine', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalography', 'Foundations', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Norepinephrine', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Psychological Theory', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral study', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'comparative', 'emerging adult', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'information processing', 'lens', 'neural network', 'psychobiology', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend', 'visual information', 'young adult']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R00,2021,247426
"Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value A range of behavioral, physiological, and cognitive responses (e.g. approach and avoidance, autonomic reactivity, and subjective feelings) reflects a subject's emotional state. The cognitive regulation of emotion refers to the capacity to regulate these emotional responses in a flexible manner according to a cognitive operation. Deficits in the cognitive regulation of emotional processes characterize many psychiatric disorders. In everyday life, however, particular sensory stimuli and/or actions can elicit different emotional responses depending upon the situation or context. Contexts often rely on a cognitive understanding of one's current situation in the absence of explicit cues. These types of contexts may be referred to as “abstract” contexts. This grant studies a type of abstract context where the context is determined by a task set. A task set is the set of stimulus- response-outcome mappings (or rules) that dictate correct performance for trials within a particular block. Previous research demonstrates the capacity of primates to learn these abstract contexts, and neural representations of abstract contexts exist in the amygdala and two areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices (ACC and OFC). This grant seeks to understand the mechanisms that underlie the formation and maintenance of these representations of contexts. In contrast to supervised learning driven by error signals, we hypothesize that the occurrence of temporally associated trial types triggers unsupervised learning, presumably through a Hebbian mechanism involving activity-dependent plasticity. This learning could underlie formation of representations of abstract contexts defined by task sets, which will be explored with electrophysiological recordings in Aim 1. The creation of a representation of a task set requires combining information about the current trial with information about the trials that have occurred recently. Brain structures that provide memory traces of recent events and/or that combine information over time could create representations of a task set prior to the emergence of the representations observed in amygdala, OFC, and ACC. Our next experiments therefore target the hippocampus and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), which are implicated in memory processes, working memory, and executive functions. We will compare and contrast the encoding of task sets in hippocampus, DLPFC, OFC, and ACC during and after learning about task sets (Aim 2). Finally, we will use causal methods to determine if PFC input to the amygdala and the hippocampus acts to maintain these context representations, which could be a vital mechanism for the cognitive regulation of emotion (Aim 3). Overall, these experiments promise to illuminate neurophysiological mechanisms critical for normal adaptive emotional health. ! The aim of this proposal is to understand brain mechanisms responsible for the cognitive regulation of emotion. Since many psychiatric disorders, like anxiety and mood disorders as well as schizophrenia, autism, and addiction, involve cognitive dysfunction mediated by neural circuits in the brain areas under study, this project promises to provide new insights about neural network function critical for developing new treatments.",Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value,10053729,R01MH082017,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Feeling', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Mood Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'addiction', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional experience', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'memory process', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurophysiology', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,682901
"Guiding next steps for SPRINT-MIND implementation: Identifying high-benefit subgroups and comparative effects of ARB- vs. ACEI-based regimens PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are the leading cause of dependence and disability in the elderly population worldwide, costing the US healthcare system over $200 billion annually. Because ADRD represents a continuous irreversible physical and cognitive decline, identifying effective approaches for its prevention is imperative. Hypertension, particularly in midlife, is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and ADRD. Recent data from the randomized Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) Intervention Trial (SPRINT) Memory and cognition IN Decreased hypertension (SPRINT MIND) demonstrated that intensive SBP control (<120 mmHg) reduced the combined incidence of adjudicated mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and probable dementia, as well as abnormal white matter lesion (WML) volume compared to standard BP control (<140 mmHg) over five years follow up. To maximize public health impact, it is critical to identify which patients derive the greatest cognitive and net (overall) benefit from intensive SBP treatment and if cognitive benefits were due to direct effects of specific antihypertensive medications on cognition independent of, or in addition to, their BP-lowering effect. Prior animal and human studies, as well as our preliminary data, suggest that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) have greater effects on cognition than angiotensin-converting- enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). If verified, this finding would be significant since ARBs and ACEIs are currently among the medications most commonly prescribed to older adults and are thought to be equivalent in benefit and safety. Our objective is to answer remaining questions of how to safely implement SPRINT in older patients most likely to derive cognitive benefits from intensive SBP treatment. With its large sample size, 5 years follow-up, and high-quality repeated measures of rigorously adjudicated cognitive outcomes, brain imaging, and antihypertensive medication use, SPRINT MIND provides a unique, cost-efficient, and ideal setting to answer these questions. We aim to: (1) develop and validate a prediction tool that quantifies patients’ expected cognitive benefits and net (overall) benefit incorporating cognitive and cardiovascular benefit and risk of SAEs under intensive SBP treatment, and (2) determine comparative effects, including dose-response, of ARB- vs. ACEI-based antihypertensive medication regimens on cognitive and brain structure outcomes independent of SBP-lowering effects. Though SPRINT MIND is among the first randomized trials to demonstrate a beneficial preventive effect on cognition, it is uncertain how SPRINT-MIND should be implemented and in which patients. Successful completion of this project will guide next steps for implementation by determining: (1) which patients derive the greatest cognitive and net (overall) benefit from intensive SBP treatment and (2) if ARBs have greater beneficial effects on cognitive outcomes and WML volume than ACEIs, independent of their similar SBP lowering effects.

"The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline Many older adults experience declines in cognitive ability that can be substantial, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Population aging, coupled with age-related cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, represents an unprecedented challenge. Early detection of cognitive impairment is a crucial goal. This would allow individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment and/or AD/ADRD to adopt lifestyle changes to minimize decrements and the risk for acquired cognitive impairment. However, the massive potential of cognitive training and longitudinal assessment to detect and prevent age-related cognitive impairment and dementia are unlikely to be realized unless individuals are willing and able to engage with these protocols for an extended period of time. Adherence to cognitive assessment and training is often poor. Addressing the gap between potential and realized benefits of early detection and prevention of cognitive impairment is an urgent goal as the population ages. The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia by 1) enhancing adherence to cognitive intervention and assessment protocols, 2) improving understanding of barriers to long-term adherence, and 3) assisting in the development of algorithms for predicting and preventing adherence failures. Projects aim to investigate these issues within samples of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Two randomized controlled trials will test an adaptive, tailored, and integrated technology support system predicted to boost adherence to cognitive protocols, over and above a simpler scheduling and reminder system over 6 months. Studies will provide valuable and generalizable insight into not only the benefits of adherence support, but also the individual difference factors that shape protocol adherence (e.g., attitudes, cognitive ability, dementia status, health status, personality, technology proficiency). Data will inform the process of identifying individuals who would benefit from additional support, and predicting and preventing extended adherence failures before they happen. By increasing adherence, these studies will help improve early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment, which will ultimately extend older adults' functional independence, improving their lives and the lives of their families, and reducing care and support resources needed to address lost independence like that associated with Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Further, intervention studies for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease can be made more efficient through tools for identifying individuals likely to experience decline before substantial cognitive impairment has occurred. Results have implications that extend far beyond cognitive impairment; the methods and mechanisms uncovered have broad implications for technology-mediated assessment and protocols to enhance health and well-being in general. The project consists of two large randomized controlled trials and smaller needs assessment and usability studies that will guide their development and deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia. This project will develop Artificial Intelligence-based reminder systems to help ensure long-term engagement to home-based cognitive assessment and cognitive training protocols to be able to detect and treat cognitive impairment as soon as possible.",The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline,10134189,R01AG064529,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Life Style', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Needs Assessment', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reminder Systems', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Weight', 'aging population', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'behavioral adherence', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cognitive training', 'design', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile computing', 'next generation', 'person centered', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,654065
"Cerebellar Interactions with the Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex during Learning Learning is how organisms adapt to changes in their environment and involves the coordination of neural systems mediating cognition, emotion, and motor control. The major goal of the proposed research program is to elucidate the neural circuit mechanisms underlying interactions between cognitive, emotional, and motor systems during associative learning. Interactions between these neural systems are particularly important because the context and emotional significance of stimuli provide essential information for acquisition and performance of motor responses. The breakdown of interactions between cognitive, emotional, and motor systems in various neurological disorders can therefore have devastating consequences for learned behaviors. The prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and cerebellum play significant roles in cognition, emotional responses, and motor learning, respectively. The proposed research program constitutes a comprehensive analysis of cerebellar interactions with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex during associative motor learning. Our general conceptual framework is that the cerebellum receives inputs from the amygdala and prefrontal cortex via the pons regarding which stimuli are important and when they occur, and the cerebellum then sends error-driven feedback to these forebrain systems to facilitate learning about important events. This conceptual framework takes into account the bidirectional relationship between the cerebellum and the relevant forebrain systems as well as interactions between forebrain systems. Multi-site electrophysiology, pathway-specific optogenetics, and precise behavioral analyses will be combined to investigate circuit-level interactions between the cerebellum, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex during associative learning and extinction (inhibitory learning) training. The proposed studies would significantly advance understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying cerebellar interactions with the forebrain. This would be a substantial contribution to the field because it has been known that the cerebellum must interact with the forebrain in many contexts that are crucial for everyday life such as learning, memory, planning, control of emotions, and communication, but very little is known mechanistically about how the cerebellum interacts with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Memory deficits are found with many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and following stroke; the breakdown of interactions between memory systems can be particularly debilitating. This proposal examines the neural mechanisms underlying interactions between emotional and motor memory systems during associative learning. Elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying memory system interactions is potentially important for developing treatments for memory deficits.",Cerebellar Interactions with the Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex during Learning,10069403,R01NS088567,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Blinking', 'Cerebellum', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Data', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pontine structure', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Prosencephalon', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioned fear', 'granule cell', 'indexing', 'learned behavior', 'learning extinction', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'two-photon']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,379571
"The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction Project Summary/Abstract Memory may be defined as the retention over time of internal representations gained through experience, and the capacity to reconstruct these representations at later times (Dudai 2007). These internal representations are thought to be encoded by long-lasting physical brain changes (memory traces or `engrams') (Josselyn, Kohler & Frankland 2015, 2017; Tonegawa et al. 2015; Schacter 2001). Remembering fear-evoking events is adaptive; it helps one make future choices based on past experience. It may even be beneficial to generalize some fearful memories. However, excessive fear generalization or treating no-longer threatening stimuli as dangerous may be maladaptive. Indeed, recurrent or inappropriately expressed fearful memories are a major component of several psychiatric diseases, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. Therefore, understanding how memory traces for fearful events are formed, change over time, under what conditions they remain specific or generalize, and how they are impacted by behavioral extinction are critical questions to not only understanding how the brain uses information but also for informing the development of new treatment/prevention strategies for disorders characterized by inappropriate fear memories. Here two PIs (Drs. Josselyn and Frankland), both New Investigators, will combine their expertise to address these important questions. Because all techniques are associated with caveats and limitations, we will use a variety of techniques including optogenetic manipulation, brain-wide neuronal activity mapping and the use of graph-theory to produce “engram maps” and real time in vivo calcium imaging combined with behavior. Together, the ability to manipulate and observe an engram as it forms, changes over time and with behavioral extinction is innovative and may lead to a shift in the very definition of an engram, as well as increase our understanding for developing treatments aimed at resolving inappropriate fear memories. Project Narrative More effective treatment approaches for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other anxiety disorders will be facilitated by better understanding how the brain forms memory traces supporting fear memories, how these change over time and with extinction.","The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction",10087966,R01MH119421,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endoscopes', 'Event', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Freezing', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Opsin', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Virus', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'data analysis pipeline', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'fear memory', 'graph theory', 'in vivo calcium imaging', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'memory consolidation', 'neuronal excitability', 'optogenetics', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHLDRN (TORONTO),R01,2021,337780
"Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Extensive progress was made in the previous funding period of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). We 1) elucidated the neuropathologic basis of cognitive decline due to Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD), 2) discovered genomic, experiential, psychological, and medical risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits including numerous risk factors for Alzheimer’s dementia with little to no relationship with ADRD brain pathologies, and 3) identified numerous potential novel therapeutic targets for cognitive decline, especially targets for cognitive decline not explained by common brain pathologies i.e., resilience. Here, the average person has average resilience and individuals can be more or less resilient. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target because if druggable it would offset the effects of any combination of brain pathologies. In this funding cycle, we propose to continue to follow MAP participants and conduct autopsies, and in this cycle, to obtain skin biopsies at autopsy to support a powerful new drug discovery program that integrates existing brain omics data with a new human cellular model of disease, i.e., skin derived fibroblast cultures induced into neuronal lines from persons with more or less resilience. We propose to: 1) define a robust and specific molecular signature of resilience in the human brain; 2) identify gene targets of resilience and establish human low-resilience cell models derived from MAP participants of known resilience; and 3) conduct drug discovery screens in the low-resilience models to identify compounds that increase resilience. These aims are supported by compelling preliminary work. An Exploratory Aim will continue to identify risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits leveraging the rich resource generated from the exposure data, repeated measures, and neuropathologic traits . All aims will examine sex as a biologic variable. A Secondary Aim will continue to share the unique and valuable resources generated by MAP including the to-be-generated fibroblast cell lines with the scientific community. Harnessing mechanisms of resilience to ADRD can slow down or prevent cognitive decline regardless of the presence and complexity of common brain pathologies. Therefore, the genes and compounds identified from our study will provide new therapeutic remedies to boost brain reserve in combating ADRD-related dementia. We believe that the proposed continuation will have a high and sustained impact on the field of aging and dementia research. POJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The identification of novel therapeutics to prevent of cognitive decline, MCI and Alzheimer’s dementia is a major public health priority. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target with the potential to maintain cognition regardless of the type and number of brain pathologies.

"Epigenetic Mechanisms of Memory Storage Project Summary / Abstract In the hours after learning, the activation of gene expression follows a specific pattern, producing transient waves of expression needed for long-term memory consolidation. These changes require non-genetic (i.e., “epigenetic”) events, including modifications to: DNA-organizing proteins known as histones, the DNA itself, and the accessibility of DNA to proteins. Additionally, the molecular changes necessary for memory require a form of RNA-based regulation. In the absence of such changes, the long-lasting regulation of gene expression during memory storage fails, and this could account for defects in memory that accompany many psychiatric disorders. Our long-term goal is to define novel epigenetic mechanisms underlying memory storage and synaptic plasticity by taking advantage of recent advances in our understanding of histone modifications, in the development of single-cell RNA technology, and in the function of regulatory mechanisms mediated by small noncoding RNAs. During the previous funding period, we defined a novel metabolic source of acetyl-CoA in the nucleus and have obtained preliminary data about new forms of histone acylation and crotonylation associated with spatial learning. We also developed bioinformatic tools to analyze single nuclear RNA sequencing data to identify neurons activated by learning. We further established the reversal of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated mRNA silencing as a novel epigenetic means of regulating activity-dependent translation, linking synaptic activity to translational upregulation of key memory-related targets. These major findings provide the basis of our proposed experiments that we believe will define the next frontiers in our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms of memory consolidation. In Specific Aim 1, we will examine the impact of a novel histone modification, histone crotonylation, on the epigenetic landscape and gene expression during memory consolidation. In Specific Aim 2, we will define cell type-specific transcriptional signatures of the hippocampal neurons during memory consolidation and retrieval. In Specific Aim 3, we will elucidate the microRNA- dependent mechanisms that regulate long-term memory and synaptic plasticity driven by a microRNA processing complex. An understanding of these key epigenetic regulatory mechanisms involved in the consolidation and storage of long-term memories is expected to ultimately lead to the development of new treatments for the debilitating cognitive deficits associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Project Narrative The regulation of specific genes critical to the storage of memories (“memory consolidation”) and changes in neuronal function (“plasticity”) vital for learning are controlled by a number of mechanisms that are not themselves regulated by genetics. We propose to determine the functional roles of such epigenetic processes in memory consolidation and plasticity, and to define the sets of genes that are activated, in individual cells, during memory consolidation. This research promises to provide information that will be critical to the development of novel therapeutics capable of alleviating the cognitive deficits underlying many psychiatric disorders.",Epigenetic Mechanisms of Memory Storage,10211384,R01MH087463,"['ATAC-seq', 'Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Acetylation', 'Acyl Coenzyme A', 'Acylation', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Coenzyme A', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histone Acetylation', 'Histones', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear RNA', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Ribonucleases', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Derepression', 'Translational Regulation', 'Translational Repression', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'epigenetic regulation', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'long term memory', 'memory consolidation', 'memory retrieval', 'new therapeutic target', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,740506
"Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control This project focuses on understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms that give rise to cognitive control. Cognitive control processes are a component of human mental function that is fundamentally important in a wide range of domains, including attention, working memory, episodic memory, and decision making. Cognitive control disruptions are thought to be a major source of functional impairment for individuals suffering from a variety of mental health disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases, which is why they feature prominently in the NIMH RDoC matrix. Over the last decade, we have developed a theoretically coherent and mechanistic model, the Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) framework, which has the following core tenets: 1) cognitive control can operate in distinct modes, proactive and reactive; 2) these modes are associated with unique dynamic neural signatures, involving a shift between sustained and transient engagement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and its interactions with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and fronto-striatal circuitry; 3) they represent a core dimension of variability, present across a range of cognitive domains (i.e., indicating a psychologically coherent construct); 4) this variability is both state-related (and thus affected by task/situation and endogenous factors) and trait-related (a key component of individual variation); and 5) the variation encompasses cognitive control function in healthy young adults, but also in more extreme forms, contributes to dysfunction present in various impaired populations (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, aging). Under a current MERIT award, we have been directly testing these core tenets of the DMC framework, through a large-scale project, which samples monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and to comprehensively characterize proactive and reactive control at the behavioral, neural, and genetic levels. The current proposal takes full advantage of the extensive infrastructure we have already developed for this project to dramatically expand its scope, explanatory depth, and utility to the scientific community. Specifically, we propose a rigorous, multi-pronged study, that integrates our optimized cognitive control task battery with mindfulness skills training (MT), a longitudinal design with repeated neuroimaging assessments, comprehensive “neuro-psychometric” characterization of individual variation utilizing state-of-the-art analytic techniques, and incorporation of current best practices (i.e., following Open Science Framework [OSF] recommendations), to maximize the transparency, reproducibility, and ease of dissemination of project tools and findings. Success is in this effort will have important theoretical and clinical implications, by providing a clearer understanding of the sources of normal human variation, and even more importantly, highlighting potential risk vulnerability factors for a range of mental health disorders. This project will provide detailed information regarding the brain-basis of normal human variation in higher mental functions such as attention, memory and decision-making, and how such functions are impacted by positive lifestyle interventions (i.e., mindfulness training). This information has high relevance for public health by furthering our understanding of the relationship between mental health and illness (e.g.,  schizophrenia, depression) and of the vulnerability and protective factors that contribute to mental illness risk.",Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control,10143063,R37MH066078,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Educational Intervention', 'Endogenous Factors', 'Ensure', 'Episodic memory', 'Equation', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Insula of Reil', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mindfulness Training', 'Modeling', 'Monozygotic twins', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychometrics', 'Recommendation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resource Sharing', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'causal model', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive enhancement', 'connectome', 'dynamic system', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'improved functioning', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'lifestyle intervention', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'mental function', 'mindfulness', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'program dissemination', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'young adult']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R37,2021,646865
"Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys 7. Abstract.  The ability to identify and follow-up neurobiological changes that occur during brain maturation and aging is not only fundamental to our understanding of cognition, but is also crucial for clinical studies that focus on either neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders, including clinical trials. While post-mortem studies provide data that are well characterized in terms of localized histological changes, these data can be limited due to their cross sectional nature and small samples sizes. In contrast, non-invasive in vivo imaging allows for the collection of longitudinal data in much larger populations, and is a more powerful tool to investigate life span trajectories of brain maturation and aging. Recent developments in neuroimaging have provided evidence for the relationship between imaging changes and cognitive aging in monkeys, and humans. Unfortunately, the cellular underpinnings of cognitive age are a subject of debate and hence the biological specificity of available imaging measures is not well established. More alarming, while older imaging measures still lack thorough validation, newer “more specific” measures that are being constantly introduced into clinical research are even further from validation. Over the past funding period, we have worked with a large repository of histological, cognitive and imaging legacy data from cognitively aging rhesus monkeys, testing the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and myelin degeneration play crucial roles in cognitive aging, and that neuroimaging biomarkers can reflect those biological processes. We propose to further our work in this direction, by proposing translational experiments that will include 1). acquiring new, high resolution “Human Connectome Project (HCP)” compatible imaging data, 2). Expand our neuroimaging by adding neuroinflammation- and myelin-specific PET radioligands, 3). Develop neuroimaging white matter-specific biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment- a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, and 4). Investigate biological underpinnings of sex differences in aging. This is enabled by a collaboration of three PIs, with unique and complementary expertise in MRI imaging, morphometry, neuroanatomy, immunohistochemistry and cognitive aging, and will be further facilitated by acquiring and analyzing behavioral, imaging, blood and post mortem data from a cohort of 24 rhesus monkeys of both sexes, 8 young adults (4 males and 4 females) and 16 old adults (8 males and 8 females, half diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. 8. Project Narrative. The three PIs and their co-investigators propose a multidisciplinary study of cognitive aging in rhesus monkeys. We plan to acquire new, state of the art imaging data, and combine it with cognitive assessments, blood measures, and postmortem brain tissue to explore the biological underpinnings and establish the specificity of the imaging biomarkers to neurobiology of cognitive aging. The results of this proposed study will greatly impact our understanding of aging processes and their mechanisms and provide tissue validated understanding of imaging measures that can be applied to studies of normal human aging as well as many other clinical populations including neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases of central nervous system.",Neural substrates of diffusion imaging in cognitively aging rhesus monkeys,10160747,R01AG042512,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Astrocytes', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cell Aging', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammation', 'Ligands', 'Longevity', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuroglia', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radio', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Specificity', 'Spin Labels', 'Stains', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Water', 'Work', 'age related', 'brain tissue', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'data acquisition', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'juvenile animal', 'male', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'myelin degeneration', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuroinflammation', 'radioligand', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change', 'young adult']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,833908
"SYMPOSIUM ON COGNITIVE AUDITORY NEUROSCIENCE (SCAN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In recent years, human cognitive auditory neuroscience has made rapid strides due to advances in human neuroimaging, the advent of innovative machine learning/big data analytic approaches, and a greater mechanistic understanding of cognitive-sensory interactions in animal models. The dynamic landscape of this emergent field necessitates a highly interdisciplinary, human and translation-centric symposium that brings together expertise across academia and industry. This application requests partial funding for the Symposium on Cognitive Auditory Neuroscience (SCAN) to be hosted in Pittsburgh, PA in July 2020 and 2022, as a joint venture between Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and University of Pittsburgh (Pitt). As a biennial meeting, SCAN aims to become the premiere intellectual and professional venue for current research in the emerging field of human cognitive auditory neuroscience. SCAN will incorporate elements typical to academic conferences (research talks, posters) as well as novel ideas that promote ‘blue sky’ thinking in this rapidly evolving field. SCAN will assiduously and innovatively work towards inclusivity and creating an atmosphere that encourages intellectual and professional engagement from women, underrepresented minorities, and individuals with disabilities. Another critical aim of the SCAN is to foster industry-academic partnerships with an eye towards translation of basic research and fostering career opportunities for trainees. Pittsburgh is uniquely situated to launch SCAN. With an enviable concentration of co-located auditory neuroscience expertise, Pittsburgh is also an intellectual hub for industries/start-ups engaged in in machine learning, natural language processing, and speech recognition. SCAN will leverage these advantages to foster growth and innovation tied to core missions of the National Institutes of Deafness and Communication Disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Symposium on Cognitive Auditory Neuroscience (SCAN) has a strong connection to deafness and communication disorders through its focus on the basic science of human cognitive auditory neuroscience, and its translation. SCAN will establish an intellectual home for dissemination of cutting-edge research in human cognitive auditory neuroscience, support the development of the next generation of scientists, build a vibrant and inclusive community that engages with the grand challenges in the field, and forge new academia-industry partnerships.",SYMPOSIUM ON COGNITIVE AUDITORY NEUROSCIENCE (SCAN),10078266,R13DC018243,"['Academia', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Americas', 'Animal Model', 'Atmosphere', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data Methods', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Fertilization', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hearing', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Influentials', 'Institutes', 'Joint Ventures', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Otolaryngology', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'deafness', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'meetings', 'millisecond', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open data', 'posters', 'pressure', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'symposium', 'virtual reality']",NIDCD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R13,2021,1766
"Secondary Analysis of Cognitive Data from the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) to Identify Longitudinal Change Phenotypes in HIV+ Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY Antiretroviral therapies (ART) have modified Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection from a nearly universal fatal disease to a manageable chronic condition, yet associated symptoms like cognitive impairments (CI) persist at a higher rate than in comparable uninfected control populations. These impairments are heterogeneous in terms of presentation (e.g. cognitive domains) and trajectory. Given that domain-specific impairments are likely due to different pathological changes, studies that investigate CI based on a global metric of impairment are likely to miss this. The application of advanced analysis methods, including machine learning to interrogate complex diseases and biological processes, is beginning to transform our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to complex diseases, including CI in the setting of HIV infection. In order to identify and characterize factors that contribute to nonlinear patterns of cognitive change, we propose to capitalize on over 20 years of data from the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). MACS is one of the largest and longest running studies of men infected with HIV, that includes a substudy with biannual neurocognitive testing that began in 1988. A complete battery of longitudinal neurocognitive testing data is available to us through this cohort, as well as concurrent datasets that include demographic, clinical, psychiatric, lifestyle and biochemical data. The data set consists of over 3500 subjects with over 500,000 data points. In Aim 1, we propose to use data-driven methods (k-means clustering for joint longitudinal trajectories and dynamic time warping) to identify groups of individuals with distinct domain-specific patterns of cognitive change. In Aim 2, we will use the vast amount of data collected on these subjects to identify subtype-specific variables that contribute or predict group membership. By using advanced machine learning methods that are unconstrained by preset statistical or biological assumptions, we are uniquely positioned to identify factors that contribute to longitudinal patterns of change in specific cognitive functions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive changes in HIV can be indicative of varying neuropathological mechanisms of impairment. This project aims to shed light on those mechanisms by analyzing pre-existing data from the MACS cohort to identify groups of HIV infected men with similar cognitive trajectories and then mining the available data to identify risk factors and contributing variables to those trajectories. By using advanced machine-learning methods to analyze non-linear patterns we will provide insights into the underlying biological mechanisms of domain-specific cognitive declines and may create an iterative framework for precision-based medicine approaches to treat cognitive impairment.",Secondary Analysis of Cognitive Data from the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) to Identify Longitudinal Change Phenotypes in HIV+ Individuals,10116489,R03MH123290,"['Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Effect', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Group Identifications', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV antiretroviral', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Motor', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Testing', 'The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visit', 'Work', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data reduction', 'executive function', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuropsychiatry', 'precision medicine', 'secondary analysis']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,81875
"Circuit Dynamics for encoding and remembering sequence of events Project Summary We experience the world as a continuous sequence of events, but we remember the events as segmented episodes (e.g., my sister’s wedding). During encoding, we associate a sequence of relevant events and segment deviant events. At retrieval, episodic memory utilizes the encoded associations to replay the flow of events. The encoded associations lead to remembering the sequence of events that occurred within an episode better than the flow of events across segments. The hippocampus and the prefrontal cortices (PFC) are essential parts of the neural circuit for segmenting, linking and retrieving memories of associated events. This proposal aims to identify neural dynamics in the hippocampus-PFC circuit that support encoding a naturalistic flow of events, i.e., sequences of words. We will determine the neural dynamics using intracranial encephalography (iEEG) acquired from the hippocampus and PFC of epileptic patients, who have electrodes implemented for pre-surgical seizure monitoring. Our experiment requires patients to listen to a narrative and later recall the flow of events. During the past year, I developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm that quantifies the associations of words depending on the narrative context. I will use NLP model for annotation of the iEEG data to determine neural dynamics engaged during encoding sequences of words. Our research program (mainly data collection), like all other human subject research, has been significantly affected by the COVID mitigation efforts. We were not able to collect the required iEEG data to fulfill the aims of the planned K99 phase during the past year. With the vaccination of researchers and medical staff and screening of patients before the hospitalization, our data collection program is reopening with considerations. The extension to the K99 will allow us to catch up with the data collection that is required for the planned training on advanced data analysis. The central hypotheses are that bidirectional communications between the hippocampus and PFC support the encoding of sequences of events and successful subsequent memory. To address a causal relationship between hippocampal function and event segmentation, I will study speech comprehension and speech memory in developmental amnesic patients who suffer from hippocampal damage and have trouble tracking reference points in a speech. The combination of iEEG, NLP modeling, and patients’ behavioral data will provide valuable insights into the neural dynamics of effective speech encoding that predicts subsequent memory, which may inform development into therapeutic interventions. Project Narrative The ability to segment the world into meaningful episodes engages the human hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Using direct electrophysiological recording from the human brain, advanced analytical techniques, Natural Language Processing models, and the behavior of patients with hippocampal lesions, this proposal will determine the neural dynamics for efficient encoding of sequences of words that predicts successful memory formation. The findings of this proposal may help inform the development of neural prosthetics for assisting patients with memory deficits.",Circuit Dynamics for encoding and remembering sequence of events,10375038,K99MH120048,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Subject Research', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Medical Staff', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Seizures', 'Sister', 'Speech', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Vaccination', 'advanced analytics', 'coronavirus disease', 'deviant', 'encephalography', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurodevelopment', 'patient screening', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2021,78705
"Circuit mechanisms of self-organized cognitive strategies   Project Summary Decades of psychology research have shown that working memory is limited, and humans can only hold a few items in mind at the same time. However, cognitive tasks like planning and problem solving require access to many pieces of information at once. To overcome this constraint, we enlist mnemonic strategies, for instance grouping pieces of information into chunks, as we commonly do to remember telephone or social security numbers. Mnemonic chunking allows us to flexibly organize information on line, providing a fundamental building block for advanced cognitive abilities. Chunking impairments occur when damage or dysfunction involves the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), for instance in patients with schizophrenia, and severely compromises overall cognitive function. Thus, determining how the brain organizes information is a necessary step toward understanding the mechanisms of advanced cognition, and how these go awry in disease states. A key challenge is that strategies for organizing information are self-generated and highly variable in a laboratory setting. A central innovation of this proposal is the novel computational approach used to identify spontaneous mnemonic chunking in macaque monkeys. This is critical because animal models allow us to interrogate brain function with advanced neurophysiological tools. Here, we will use high-density, multi-site recording and targeted neuromodulation to understand the circuit mechanisms that chunk mnemonic information. Previous theoretical work suggests that chunks arise from compressed working memory representations that act as neural shorthand, economizing on processing resources at the cost of degrading some original information. Neurons in dlPFC encode items in working memory, and their dynamics are shaped by recurrent interactions with the basal ganglia. Thus, we hypothesize that corticostriatal interactions promote the efficient reorganization of working memory that underlies chunking. To test this we will investigate dlPFC- striatal dynamics when monkeys spontaneously chunk information in a self-organized working memory task. We will record large numbers of single neurons and local field potentials, and dynamically decode representations held in working memory to assess how mnemonic codes and corticostriatal interactions change when items are or are not chunked. In addition, exogenous stimulation will test the causal role of striatal circuits in promoting the formation of mnemonic chunks. Together, these experiments will determine how the brain establishes mnemonic chunks to optimize working memory performance. This will shed light on a fundamental feature of advanced cognition, and how dysfunction in these mechanisms could give rise to disorders of thought and memory. Finally, understanding mechanisms that optimize cognitive function in a biological system may fuel creative advances that optimize performance in artificial intelligence systems.   Project Narrative This project focuses on understanding circuit dynamics in the prefrontal cortex that mediate mnemonic chunking, a critical strategy for improving working memory performance in advanced cognition. Specifically, we will assess how mnemonic information is bound together in the dynamics of frontal and striatal circuits, and whether these processes can be enhanced with targeted circuit modulation. Our results could provide insights into core deficits in cognitive disorders, such as schizophrenia, and open the door for novel approaches that enhance cognitive function in the setting of working memory deficits.",Circuit mechanisms of self-organized cognitive strategies,10098347,R01MH121480,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Expert Systems', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Shorthand', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Security Number', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Work', 'behavior test', 'biological systems', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'density', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'memory recall', 'microstimulation', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,460527
"Heritability and cognitive implications of structural-functional connectome coupling The human brain is an unimaginably complicated system of interconnected neurons that is capable of complex thought, emotion and behavior. Macroscale white matter connections quantified via the structural connectome (SC) act as the backbone for the flow of functional activation, which can be represented via the functional con- nectome (FC). Our group and others have shown that quantifying properties of the brain’s structural and func- tional connectomes and their relationship can inform understanding of brain-behavior associations and disease mechanisms4-9. However, models that describe SC-FC relationships have only achieved moderate agreement with observations and have not been used to fully explore the heritability and cognitive implications of structure- function coupling in adult and developing populations. If we do not accurately understand how the brain’s anat- omy and physiology are linked across the human lifespan, then we will not be able to quantify the impact of disease or pathological developmental trajectories. Our long-term goal is to create computational tools for stud- ying the brain’s structure and function, particularly in the context of disease. The overarching objective of this project is to create a model that accurately {and interpretably} quantifies the coupling between the structural and functional connectomes in both sexes, which will in turn allow us to investigate the heritability and cognitive implications of SC-FC coupling across developing and adult populations. Our central hypothesis is that a {hybrid approach to predicting FC from SC, combining both biophysical modeling and deep learning,} will be more ac- curate than existing techniques. Based on the prior literature and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that SC- FC coupling will vary with sex, be heritable, associated with development, and explain inter-subject variability in cognition. Our hypothesis is supported by preliminary data from our group and others that show SC-FC relation- ships are heritable and vary with sex and cognition in patients7,18. The rationale for this work is that having an accurate model of the SC-FC relationship in healthy populations, which currently does not exist, will further our understanding of the complex relationship between anatomy, physiology, sex, genetics and cognition. We will test the central hypothesis via three specific aims: 1) identify the most accurate model for predicting FC from SC, 2) quantify the heritability of SC-FC coupling and its association with cognitive performance and 3) characterize the SC-FC coupling trajectory and its cognitive implications throughout development. We will use neuroimaging, genetic and cognitive data from the Human Connectome Project, including young adult (~1000 individuals, 22- 37 years) and developing populations (~650 individuals, 5-21 years). The approach is innovative, as it proposes to use model-driven, data-driven and hybrid approaches to model SC-FC relationships and that it poses to ex- plore sex effects, heritability, cognitive and developmental implications of SC-FC relationships. The proposed research is significant in that understanding structure-function relationships across typical development will allow quantification of the impact of disease and reveal avenues for novel treatments in various neurological diseases. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the relationship between brain anatomy, physiology, genetics and cognition throughout human development is paramount to understanding of how it can break down in disease. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NICHD's mission in that it seeks to understand human development and optimize abilities for all.",Heritability and cognitive implications of structural-functional connectome coupling,10189014,RF1MH123232,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Maps', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurons', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sex Differences', 'Ships', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genome-wide', 'human data', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,RF1,2021,1292521
"Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses As the population continues to age and rates of late-life cognitive impairment rise, early detection of cognitive impairment is increasingly important for the timely implementation of interventions and safety initiatives. This may be particularly important in individuals found to have high brain amyloid burden, putting them at particular risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) of the brain. Performance changes in challenging, complex, high-stakes daily activities, such as driving, and accompanying physiological responses may together provide an inexpensive avenue for early detection. This may serve the dual purpose of alerting individuals or health care providers to early cognitive impairment, as well as to potential safety issues. Sophisticated in-car technology that is increasingly becoming standard in new vehicles may provide the means to unobtrusively capture sensitive information about naturalistic driving behaviors and potentially assist with early detection of cognitive impairment. The proposed study will apply a novel approach to unobtrusively monitor older drivers in (a) naturalistic, (b) fixed course, and (c) simulator driving situations. Machine learning approaches will be used to select key features of driving behaviors and physiological measures of arousal in all driving scenarios and eye tracking measures from fixed and simulator drives to predict drivers’ clinical diagnosis: young adult drivers, healthy older drivers with and without high amyloid burden, and drivers with mild cognitive impairment with evident amyloid burden. The participants will be followed longitudinally in the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC) with annual cognitive and neurological evaluations, as well as repeat driving and physiological testing at two years from baseline. Understanding and identifying changes in driving behaviors and how these predict who will develop clinically identifiable cognitive impairment will lead to the development of a model for early detection of cognitive decline and ADRD. This study will examine everyday driving behaviors and physiological measures obtained by in-car monitors during common driving situations (e.g., intersections, freeway ramps). The goal is to build a model that uses features from these in-car measures to detect small driving changes that may be the earliest indicators of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults. Utilizing data gathered unobtrusively from vehicles is cost effective, readily available, and may alert individuals and health care providers of early cognitive concerns, as well as potential safety issues.",Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses,10261410,R01AG068338,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Arousal', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Language Development', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Ramp', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Skin Temperature', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic platform', 'driving behavior', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'implementation intervention', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel strategies', 'older driver', 'programs', 'psychological aspect of aging', 'rate of change', 'recruit', 'response', 'smart watch', 'social', 'visual tracking', 'young adult', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,1484783
"Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dementia is among the most daunting public health crises facing industrialized nations. Many countries, including the United States,1 have recently adopted comprehensive national dementia strategies.2 The US National Dementia Strategy (section 2B) has identified early diagnosis and links to community treatment services as pillars of its management plan. The availability of evidence-based outpatient treatment for progressive language impairments remains exceedingly sparse. In 2014, we began to address this void via a longitudinal intervention targeting maintenance of a core vocabulary consisting of 100 words over two years. This caregiver-friendly treatment is showing great promise for promoting the retention of key vocabulary in frontotemporal degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. A secondary aim involved evaluating prediction of later language forgetting. We have learned much during this initial project period, and its renewal has the potential to tell us much more. Our current proposal consists of three aims, all of which directly align both with the US National Dementia Strategy and the mission of our funding institute (i.e., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders).3 In Specific Aim 1 (SA1), we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a regimen of noninvasive brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation) delivered over the anterior temporal lobes as an adjuvant to our ongoing semantic behavioral treatment. We will do so using a crossover design where two groups of patients with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia complete sham and active stimulation conditions paired with behavioral treatment (order counterbalanced). We will subsequently follow this patient cohort over two years to evaluate the durability of treatment gains. In SA2, we will evaluate predictors of emerging cognitive-linguistic impairment in a vastly underserved population (i.e., older African American adults). We will identify older adults who are at increased risk for conversion to mild cognitive impairment as indexed by global cognitive and language measures. We will then follow and characterize this prospective cohort using sensitive behavioral (gaze patterns during visual confrontation naming) and neuropsychological markers. Finally, in SA3 we will evaluate representation, processing, and shifts in abstract word meaning as functions of age, pathology, and individual differences (e.g., vocabulary size, years of education) using machine learning. This renewal reflects the continuation of a productive and rigorous line of research that will yield complementary data about human semantic memory, best practices in promoting language maintenance, and variability of age-associated language change. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will investigate the effectiveness of pairing non-invasive brain stimulation with an ongoing behavioral treatment targeting maintenance of a small functional vocabulary in patients with progressive naming disorders. In a secondary sequence of aims, we will evaluate processing of abstract words (e.g., love, truth) and prediction of evolving language impairment in a prospective cohort of lower-income, predominantly minority older adults with the aim of improving early detection of cognitive-linguistic decline.",Early Detection and Treatment of Emerging Cognitive-Linguistic Impairment in Minority Cognitive Aging and Primary Progressive Aphasia,10119275,R01DC013063,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Atrophic', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain region', 'Caregivers', 'Cathodes', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Comprehension', 'Country', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Emotions', 'Episodic memory', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Love', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Molecular Target', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Progressive Aphasias', 'Property', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'drug discovery', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'forgetting', 'frontal lobe', 'frontotemporal degeneration', 'gaze', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neurological rehabilitation', 'noninvasive brain stimulation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sound', 'stroke-induced aphasia', 'supervised learning', 'treatment services', 'voltage']",NIDCD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,470083
"Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging PROJECT SUMMARY Progressive aging-related cognitive declines are associated with limitations in self-care and functional independence, deteriorating physical health, and impending dementia and mortality, even among the otherwise healthy. Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie cognitive aging is key to developing interventions to prevent or ameliorate cognitive decline. Disconnection theories of aging specifically implicate weakening of structural brain connectivity as a key mechanism of cognitive decline, but until recently, diffusion MRI data and connectomic methods needed to rigorously test such theories have been lacking. To expedite understanding how aging-related changes in the human structural connectome relate to aging-related cognitive declines, we will apply the latest connectomic and multivariate data analysis methods to existing data from two highly unique datasets: (1) The UK Biobank, a cross-sectional sample of ~10,000 40-75 year old adults, who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information; and (2) The Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936, a narrow-age cohort of older adults (baseline age = 73 years; N = 731) who have undergone diffusion MRI scanning, have been measured with multiple cognitive tests, and have provided extensive sociodemographic and medical information on each of three separate occasions, each separated by three years. Using recently developed graph-theoretic models, we will construct structural brain connectome networks for each participant's diffusion MRI data at each wave and extract indices reflective of network topology within several specific networks of interest (NOIs) identified ex ante. We will also identify topologically central hub regions that disproportionately govern efficiency within each individual's connectome network. We will apply cross-sectional and longitudinal structural equation models to examine aging-related transformations in network indices, examine concurrent and longitudinal coupling between network indices and cognitive abilities, and test predictors of levels and changes in network indices and cognitive abilities. This will allow us to contrast the predictive utility of the selected NOIs for cognitive aging and to identify specific features of network architecture involved in cognitive aging and mediate the effects of demographic, medical, and lifestyle risk factors for cognitive aging. We additionally implement machine- learning methods to estimate an upper bound of prediction of cognitive aging from network indices, and identify novel features of network topology as candidate mechanisms of cognitive decline. The availability of two uniquely large and well-characterized datasets will allow us to ensure that findings are rigorous and reproducible using within sample (holdout) and between sample cross-validation. For all aims, we will place considerable emphasis on testing for incremental validity of network indices relative to both conventional structural neuroanatomical measures and topologically naïve summary indices of network integrity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying and understanding the neurodegenerative processes that underlie aging-related cognitive declines is key to developing interventions to improve both health and quality of life. This project will examine how changes in the structural connections between brain regions relate to changes in cognitive abilities over time and test hypothesized health, sociodemographic, and genetic predictors of such changes.",Evaluating Longitudinal Changes in the Human Structural Connectome in Relation to Cognitive Aging,10163115,R01AG054628,"['3 year old', '3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Genetic', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction Time', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Self Care', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'aged', 'biobank', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'feature selection', 'functional independence', 'genetic predictors', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'social', 'sociodemographic predictors', 'sociodemographics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2021,470535
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Exploiting Voice Assistant Systems for Early Detection of Cognitive Decline Early detection of the cognitive decline involved in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD)  in older adults living alone is essential for developing, planning, and initiating interventions and support  systems to improve patients' everyday function and quality of life. Conventional, clinic-based methods for  early diagnosis are expensive, time-consuming, and impractical for large-scale screening. This project aims to develop a low-cost, passive, and practical home-based assessment method using Voice Assistant  Systems (VAS) for early detection of cognitive decline, including a set of novel data mining techniques for  sparse time-series speech. The project has three specific aims: 1. Using a recurrent neural network  (RNN) and a softmax regression model, we will develop a transfer learning technique to investigate the  link between the speech from in-lab VAS tasks and cognitive decline. The Pitt corpus from the  DementiaBank database will be used to optimize the RNN parameters and thereby overcome the limited  data problem of VAS. The softmax regression model will allow us to align the feature distributions from the  previous speech data and in-lab VAS speech. 2. We will develop a novel ""many-to-difference"" prediction  model with a symmetric RNN structure to predict the cognitive difference at two ends of a time period from  the sparse time-series data. The proposed model is different from previous ones as the learning focus is  shifted from the short-term pattern differences across users to the pattern difference over time for an  individual user. The proposed model accommodates well for the highly dynamic nature of the inputs and  maximally removes individual characteristics from the prediction result. To analyze the sparse time-series  speech, a new data sampling technique will be used to address the imbalanced data problem, and a data  quality metric will be developed for the proposed model. 3. The team will conduct an 18-month in-lab  evaluation and a 28-month in-home evaluation with a focus on whether the VAS tasks and features from  the in-lab evaluation and the repetition features of the in-home VAS data can measure and predict  cognitive decline in the in-home participants over time. The proposed methods will be integrated into an  interactive system to enable efficient communication on cognitive decline among patients, caregivers, and  clinicians. If successful, the outcomes of this project will provide an opportunity to provide supportive  evidence to clinicians for the early detection of cognitive impairment outside of a clinic-based setting. This project aims to develop a low-cost, passive, and practical cognitive assessment method using Voice  Assistant Systems (VAS) for early detection of cognitive decline. If successful, the proposed system may  be widely disseminated for the early diagnosis of cognitive impairment to complement existing diagnostic  modalities that could ultimately enable long-term patient and caregiver planning to maintain individual's  independence at home.",SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Exploiting Voice Assistant Systems for Early Detection of Cognitive Decline,10190783,R01AG067416,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'improved', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'recurrent neural network', 'screening']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS BOSTON,R01,2021,292596
