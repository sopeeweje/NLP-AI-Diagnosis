"Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Project summary Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, occur in up to 5% of the population in the United States, and are associated with lifelong disability. There are multiple difficulties in obtaining an accurate diagnosis of FASD, including subtlety of physical features and heterogeneity in presentation. Consequently, FASD is grossly under-recognized, and the majority of affected children never receive a diagnosis. If FASD could be diagnosed earlier and with more reliability, many years of beneficial intervention would not be lost. The objective of this research is to apply machine learning to high-dimensional data in well-characterized data sets to predict or characterize children with FASD. The central hypothesis of this research is that the application of machine learning will accurately predict and recognize FASD compared with expert clinical diagnosis. To test this hypothesis, machine learning will be employed to: 1) characterize FASD based on the presence of non-cardinal malformations, 2) establish multivariate predictors of FASD in preschool aged children, and 3) identify diagnosis specific neurodevelopmental markers that distinguish alcohol related neurodevelopmental deficits from neurodevelopmental deficits without prenatal exposure. Two secondary data sources will be used in this proposal; a prospective study of 400 pregnant women and their offspring in Ukraine (half of whom consumed high amounts of alcohol) with full clinical evaluations for FASD, and a cross- sectional study of over 2,900 first grade children in four regions of the U.S., all with clinical FASD evaluations. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, the expected contribution is for more accurate prediction and recognition of children with FASD. The proposed research is innovative, as it represents a departure from current practice by incorporating machine learning techniques into predictive models of FASD. As a perinatal epidemiologist, I have a strong foundation in analytic techniques, and the advanced training in machine learning will further enhance these skills. Additionally, the disease-focused training in dysmorphology and neurodevelopment will provide a strong foundation to make significant contributions to the field of FASD research. Finally, training and mentoring in grant writing and the responsible conduct of research will provide a strong foundation to transition to an independent researcher. This proposed research builds on previous NIAAA funded research by my interdisciplinary mentoring team, who are all strongly supportive of this research and training plan. This seminal application of machine learning to FASD research will demonstrate its capacity to predict and identify affected children, ultimately leading to earlier intervention of children prenatally exposed to alcohol. Narrative Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are common and result in lifelong disabilities; however, they are clini- cally difficult to identify, and the vast majority of children with FASD are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The proposed research will leverage recent advances in machine learning to better identify children with FASD. These advances would lead to earlier identification and intervention in the lives of children prenatally exposed to alcohol, which can improve their developmental outcomes.",Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure,9805491,K01AA027811,"['Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Nursery Schools', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'United States', 'Writing', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aged', 'alcohol exposure', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'disability', 'fetal diagnosis', 'first grade', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malformation', 'multidimensional data', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel strategies', 'offspring', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'research clinical testing', 'responsible research conduct', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'success']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K01,2019,164791,0.016974912797826376
"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9791316,R00ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'random forest', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2019,246653,0.12708383827027345
"Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures: Administrative Supplement for U3 Populations Project Summary/Abstract of the PRIME parent award: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are major causes of perinatal mortality and morbidity and have profound consequences for maternal and child health, but it is unclear if and how rates of HDP are changing over time, or whether neighborhood conditions (e.g., racial residential segregation) and air pollution exposure are associated with risk of developing HDP. We use detailed birth records and Bayesian spatial analysis methods to better understand how HDP rates have changed over a 20 year period (1995-2014), whether racial/ethnic disparities in HDP rates have narrowed or widened in this time frame, and if neighborhood racial segregation and air pollution exposure are associated with an individual’s HDP risk.",Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures: Administrative Supplement for U3 Populations,9911827,R01ES028819,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Air Pollution', 'Architecture', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Birth Records', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Geography', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Time', 'Unemployment', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'data resource', 'early childhood', 'health care availability', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'perinatal morbidity', 'pollutant', 'pregnancy disorder', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'segregation', 'social', 'social stress', 'stressor', 'tool', 'web site']",NIEHS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,117375,0.096496030745392

"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health.

"Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development Project Summary/Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include multiple classes of chemicals that have been used extensively in consumer products. Mounting evidence from toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest EDCs are developmental neurotoxicants, and EDC exposure during the critical in utero period is associated with adverse child cognitive development. Unfortunately, current research focuses on individual EDCs and largely ignores joint and interactive effects of EDCs and the overall effect of the EDC mixture. To assess exposure to multiple EDCs simultaneously, one must consider the high dimensionality of the exposure matrix and the complex correlation structures across chemicals in statistical analyses. To address limitations of existing methods, we propose to adapt a robust technique that is well-established for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We specifically aim to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a type of robust Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization, to determine the patterns of exposure to four ubiquitous classes of EDCs known to cross the placenta—polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols (e.g., bisphenol A), and phthalates—and to characterize the relationship between these exposure patterns and cognitive development. LDA is empirically-driven so that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the number of patterns, and the non-negativity constraint enhances the interpretability of the patterns identified. For our health model, we will use a supervised approach that allows child cognitive scores to inform the LDA solution, thereby enabling identification of patterns most relevant to the outcome. We will conduct this work using the existing infrastructure of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study, a longitudinal birth cohort of mother-child dyads. We will also establish reproducibility of the method by creating a user-friendly R package so that other researchers can easily apply LDA in environmental epidemiology, and we will verify transferability and functionality of the method on a separate cohort. This will be the first study to assess the interacting and overall effects of multiple EDCs on child cognitive development, introducing LDA as a straight-forward tool for the analysis of complex mixtures in epidemiology. If successful, this method has broader implications for environmental epidemiology, as it can easily be applied to other environmental mixtures of interest. The activities encompassed by this proposal (study design, data management, advanced statistics, machine learning, data science, and presentation of findings) cover the set of fundamental research skills required by a scientist entering the interdisciplinary field of environmental epidemiology in the era of Big Data and Precision Public Health. The applied experience gained from carrying out this research, in combination with didactic training and individual cross-disciplinary mentoring, comprises a comprehensive research training plan that will serve as a platform from which to launch a career as an independent investigator in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative This study will be the first to determine existing patterns of cross-class endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in utero and to evaluate their association with child cognitive development, assessing potentially non- linear independent effects, non-additive interactions, and the overall effect of the mixture. This will help to identify environmental risk factors most amenable to public health interventions and inform future researchers and policy makers about concurrent exposure to EDCs in a vulnerable population The adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for pattern identification and dimension reduction in environmental epidemiology integrates data science and machine learning into environmental health research, which is novel and extremely relevant to public health, as LDA can be easily applied to other environmental mixtures and co-exposures of interest.",Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development,9681837,F31ES030263,"['Address', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cosmetics', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Flame Retardants', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Paint', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenols', 'Placenta', 'Plastics', 'Policy Maker', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Urine', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'consumer product', 'data management', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fundamental research', 'health of the mother', 'high dimensionality', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'modifiable risk', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'pollutant', 'polybrominated diphenyl ether', 'prenatal exposure', 'public health intervention', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2019,31591,0.09125216890124757
"Spatiotemporal Risk Assessment Modeling of Chemical Mixtures Project Summary: Comprehensive exposure assessments that account for mixtures of environmental chemical pollutants are vital to understand true relationships between human exposures and disease outcomes. Moreover, human or daily mobility of people is often misrepresented by exposure models resulting in exposure misclassification. This proposal aims to determine how air pollution chemical mixtures and human mobility impact environmental and human health risk assessments, which aligns with the NIEHS core mission “to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives.” The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. The primary mentor, Dr. Kim Anderson, a professor at Oregon State University is an expert in passive exposure assessment methods and analytical quantification of chemical mixtures in environmental media, which provides an excellent environment to transition the candidate from a background in single-pollutant exposure assessment to multi-pollutant mixture exposure and risk assessment. Along with new teaching opportunities, the candidate will receive training from Dr. Anderson in research methods such as primary data collection, biochemical monitoring for epidemiological studies, and toxicology approaches in risk assessment. Collaborators Drs. Katrina Waters and Justin Teeguarden, senior scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, will provide career development advising and research training in areas such as data integration for epidemiology and toxicology studies and hands-on experience with large-scale computational resources. This proposal’s aims will address the following central hypotheses: (1) Accounting for chemical mixtures in exposure will produce synergistic health effects not observed by chemicals individually, and (2) Personal sampling and model-based exposure assessment accounting for human mobility will produce varying risk estimates depending on the pollutant and individuals’ mobility. During the K99 phase, aim 1 will collect multi-chemical air quality data for a daily time resolved stationary monitoring campaign resulting in a space and time resolved multi-pollutant (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds) air quality dataset. Aim 2 will develop spatiotemporal exposure models for gas-phase mixtures using land use regression, geostatistical, and machine learning models. In the R00 phase, aim 3 will perform a risk assessment for chemical mixtures and acute lung health effects accounting for human mobility using a case-crossover design and comparing three exposure assessment methods: traditional spatiotemporal models, spatiotemporal models accounting for human mobility, and personal exposure monitors. Together, this proposal addresses the major limitations in environmental exposure assessment, pollutant mixtures and human mobility, and is within the mixtures and air pollution focus areas of environmental exposure research at NIEHS. Project Narrative The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. This study will validate spatiotemporal statistical approaches in chemical mixture exposure modelling, evaluate the cumulative effects of chemical mixtures in air pollution and acute lung health effects, and determine the extent of exposure misclassification due to human mobility.

"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices1-4. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children5-7. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes8-10. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides11. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures12,13, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized14,15. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid16. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California17-20, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind21,22, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics23 to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,9764378,K99ES028743,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K99,2019,81281,0.11186389504436432
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9747247,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,682492,0.06696692233745705
"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak).

"Maternal circulating miRNA function in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is the leading non-genetic cause of intellectual and other brain disabilities. However, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), estimated to affect ~2-5% of school-aged children in the US, remain difficult to diagnose and to prevent. Our recent work (PMCID 5102408) identified several circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in heavy alcohol-consuming pregnant women whose expression levels in the 2nd and 3rd trimester predicted adverse infant outcomes including craniofacial anomalies and neurobehavioral and growth deficits1. Specifically, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) models identified 11 elevated plasma miRNAs in mothers whose infants were severely affected by alcohol consumption. Using Random Forest Analysis (RFA), we were further able to use a distinct group of miRNAs to classify infants apparently unaffected by ethanol exposure with affected infants as opposed to alcohol unexposed infants. Aside from their diagnostic value, it is unknown if these Maternal circulating miRNAs associated with Adverse Infant Outcomes (M-circmiRNA-aAIO) contribute to the developmental pathologies of FASD. Bioinformatic analysis suggests these circulating miRNAs potentially regulate important hub genes for STAT3 and ephrin signaling pathways, which are in turn known to control cycles of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) crucial for normal embryogenesis and placental and fetal development. Therefore, my overarching hypothesis is that PAE impairs early development by interfering with the endocrine action of circulating maternal miRNAs on both the placenta and fetus. In my research proposal, using both human cell lines and in vivo mouse models, I will test the hypothesis that pathogenic levels of circulating miRNAs mediate effects of ethanol on placenta and fetus and that they control embryo growth and survival by regulating EMT-like behaviors of key placental and fetal cells. The long-term goals of this project will be to develop interventional strategies that exploit the biology of endocrine circulating miRNAs in mitigating negative outcomes due to PAE and other teratogens. My immediate goals will be to define the role of maternal miRNAs, which predict FASD outcomes, on placental and embryo growth and development. Aim 1: Determine the impact of M-circmiRNA-aAIOs on trophoblast growth, survival, migration and invasion under basal and ethanol exposed conditions. Aim 2: Determine the impact of M-circmiRNA-aAIOs on embryonic growth, death, and cellular maturation/differentiation under basal and ethanol exposed conditions. Aim 3: Determine the impact of M-circmiRNA-aAIOs on in vivo fetal development and neonatal outcomes. My studies are expected to uncover novel endocrine and pregnancy related functions of FASD-associated maternal systemic miRNAs and may provide novel therapeutic targets and non-invasive modalities to mitigate effects of PAE. Given its translational potential, this project will further my training as a physician-scientist interested in pursuing both clinical duties and research on early developmental disorders. Project Narrative Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is the leading non-genetic cause of intellectual and other brain disabilities. This project seeks to characterize the endocrine function of maternal circulating microRNAs, predictive of adverse infant outcome following PAE, on the developing fetus and placenta. The goal of these studies is to uncover new therapeutic targets which can mitigate the effects of PAE and consequently prevent Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). This goal is consistent with the mission of the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, which is to find ways to ‘reduce alcohol-related problems’ by research in ‘prevention and treatment’.",Maternal circulating miRNA function in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,9638420,F31AA026505,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Endoderm', 'Ephrins', 'Epithelial', 'Ethanol', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Fetus', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Mediating', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesoderm', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuroectoderm', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Placenta', 'Placentation', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'STAT3 gene', 'School-Age Population', 'Scientist', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Signal Pathway', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol related problem', 'base', 'circulating microRNA', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'fetus cell', 'human female', 'human male', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infant outcome', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'neonatal outcome', 'neurobehavioral', 'new therapeutic target', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'offspring', 'placental morphology', 'pregnant', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'stem cell biology', 'trophoblast', 'undergraduate research']",NIAAA,TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCE CTR,F31,2019,33461,0.005581346261560308
"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9774005,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Buprenorphine', 'Calcarine Sulcus', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methadone', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'critical period', 'drug of abuse', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal drug exposure', 'fetal opioid exposure', 'illicit opioid', 'imaging modality', 'in utero', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'joint attention', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'motor control', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid use', 'opioid use in pregnancy', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prescription opioid', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'standard of care', 'visual control', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,702420,0.09452357981802266
"Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children Maternal substance use disorders are a substantial public health concern and the neurological consequences of prenatal exposure are a major threat to the long-term health of offspring. Globally, prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is between 2-7 and 20-50 per 1000, respectively. By contrast, in certain high-risk communities in South Africa, prevalence is reported to be as high as 63 and 155 per 1000, respectively. Though prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to affect the central nervous system, to date, little data exists in respect of the impact of PAE in early childhood, before both higher-level brain networks are established and other potentially confounding post- natal environmental influences have come into play. For neurodevelopmental disorders, studies have consistently shown that early intervention, based on detection and targeted interventions, leads to better long-term outcomes. We aim to address this precise gap in knowledge by imaging the brain and 3D face across the FASD continuum to investigate early biomarkers, trajectories and functional correlates of PAE in a cohort followed prospectively from birth to age 6 years. Data: Our cohort includes a well characterized subsample of children (PAE and healthy controls) enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Health Study in Cape Town, South Africa, who have been scanned as neonates and at 2-3 years of age. Preliminary published data shows highly significant relationships between PAE and regional gray and white matter changes, already discernible in newborns, well before the age FASD is typically diagnosed. An additional longitudinal assessment at 6-years will yield a unique FASD sample with 3 distinct time points (infants, toddlers and children), allowing characterization of brain and face morphology and brain structure and function in this previously understudied early developmental period. This proposal addresses fundamental gaps concerning the presence, timing and regional specificity of altered brain morphology and structural and functional connectivity in association with the effects of PAE on the developing brain from birth to 6 years, and the relationships with facial dysmorphology. The research team has successfully gathered data from the proposed cohort as neonates and at 2–3 years of age. The benefits of extending this research to a subsequent imaging time-point, with a larger range of developmental and neurobehavioral assessments, provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine longitudinal effects of PAE on the trajectory of the developing brain in these critical early years, the links between neural and face predictors of PAE and the long-term clinical significance of these findings. This research will illuminate early neurodevelopmental mechanisms leading to subsequent behavioral and neurological disturbances, which may allow opportunities for targeting interventions when brain plasticity is still relatively fluid. This project might also lead to new strategies for early diagnosis using both face and brain biomarkers. Project Narrative Fetal exposure of the brain to alcohol can trigger brain abnormalities that unfold over a lifetime with severe consequences both for the affected individual and for society at large. To date, these brain abnormalities and associated deficits and behaviors have mostly been studied in late childhood or later, with very few studies following the consequences of well documented fetal alcohol exposure as they develop in the same individual across time in early childhood when the brain is most responsive to potential treatments. This project will extend an ongoing study of children with fetal alcohol exposure, already characterized as newborns and at age 2-3 to add assessments of the brain and behavior at age 6 and will explore alcohol-induced facial abnormalities as a complementary predictor of brain problems. !",Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children,9788191,R01AA026834,"['2 year old', '3 year old', '3-Dimensional', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neonatal', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'alcohol exposure', 'antenatal', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'efficacy testing', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal alcohol use', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal depression', 'multimodality', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal exposure', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'shape analysis', 'statistics', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,498954,0.07453205105355876
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary This request for a renewal of funding is in response to the NIH/NIAAA funding opportunity entitled, “Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)” (RFA-AA-17-007). The overarching aim of the current proposal is to develop, validate, and implement clinically novel and innovative measurement tools to accurately identify children who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. The proposed study is relevant to the overall objective of the CIFASD funding opportunity “to accelerate specific areas of research related to the translation of new or improved capabilities in FASD clinical case recognition.” This is critical need. While there has been a concerted research effort since the initial clinical delineation of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), understanding the full spectrum of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure remains incomplete, hindering effective intervention. Although individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure may experience significantly impairing functional difficulties, identification of these individuals is inadequate. High rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis result in lost opportunities for intervention and misunderstanding of the etiology of observed difficulties. Development of accurate and specific identification tools will improve diagnostic capability and clinical decision-making regarding treatment. To this end, during previous funding periods we substantially enhanced the understanding of the specificity of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure to increase identification of alcohol-affected youth. Our hierarchical CIFASD Decision Tree, developed and validated on over 800 subjects, indicates that administration of just 4 measures can distinguish alcohol-affected youth from nonexposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions with accuracy rates of >80%. While a significant step forward, the Decision Tree was developed and validated in a research sample with a high risk of alcohol effects. One aim of the current proposal is to develop and test an electronic version of the Decision Tree (the eTree) in lower risk, international, population-based, and clinic-based samples. Another aim of the proposal, in line with the specific RFA goal to use innovative technologies to screen for dysmorphology and/or neurobehavioral deficits to aid in the identification of alcohol-exposed individuals, is the development and implementation of the FASD Online Neurobehavioral Screen (FONS), a web-based neurobehavioral assessment tool for use with subjects recruited via a web portal (cf. Foroud U01). The FONS will measure domains known to be affected in FASD, including those represented in diagnostic criteria for neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE). The eTree and the FONS will be validated using laboratory-based in-person neuropsychological assessment of children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and non-exposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions.

"Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment. Abstract Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities, with prevalence estimates of 3-10/1000 individuals in the US and up to 80/1000 in endemic communities. The promise of an increasing number of interventions tailored to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-related neurobehavioral deficits is limited by diagnostic difficulties in clinical practice. Currently known biomarkers of exposure are neither sensitive nor specific for neurobehavioral deficits, in part because not all exposed children are affected. There is, therefore, a critical need for biomarkers of effect to identify affected children who would benefit from early, tailored therapeutic interventions. A growing body of literature has demonstrated alcohol-induced alterations in epigenetic programming as an important potential mechanism in FASD, suggesting that such alterations may serve as biomarkers of effect. Imprinted genes comprise a unique subset of epigenetically regulated genes that is sensitive to prenatal insults. There is considerable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected by FASD and those seen in experimental animal models of imprinted gene dysregulation, including learning, memory, and attachment. In a prenatally- recruited, prospective longitudinal cohort, we recently found that PAE was associated with alterations in placental level of expression of 11 of 93 expressed imprinted genes. Expression changes for five of these genes statistically mediated effects of alcohol on postnatal growth, identifying these alterations as biomarkers of fetal alcohol growth restriction. Given the remarkable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected in FASD and those affected by alteration of imprinted gene expression in animal models, alcohol-induced alterations in placental imprinted gene expression may also provide biomarkers for FASD neurocognitive deficits. Although most epigenetic marks are specific to tissue-type and timing of exposure, genomic imprinting maps and our pilot data indicate that markers of imprinted gene dysregulation identified in placental tissue may be detected in blood samples obtained at older ages. The aims of this study are: (1) To characterize the fetal alcohol-related imprintome signature in the placenta and in blood samples obtained at 6 yr; (2) To identify alterations in imprinted gene level of expression and ICR methylation that can serve as biomarkers of effect; (3) To validate findings in Aims 1 and 2 in blood samples from a 2nd, independent cohort. The data for this study will come from two prospective longitudinal cohorts recruited from the Cape Coloured community in Cape Town, South Africa, where the prevalence of FASD is among the highest in the world. Results from this study will make it possible to identify affected children who would benefit from early therapeutic interventions but would likely not be detected by current diagnostic tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite widespread public health advisories, alcohol use during pregnancy persists in the U.S. and worldwide, making fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental delay. The promise of an ever-increasing number of interventions tailored to FASD deficits is limited by difficulties in identifying fetal alcohol-related facial dysmorphology in infancy and early childhood, when interventions are most effective, and in children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, in which neurodevelopmental impairment occurs in the absence of dysmorphic features. This proposal seeks to identify alterations in imprinted gene expression that can be used as biomarkers of adverse effect to identify infants and children with FASD who would benefit from therapeutic interventions but would probably not be detected by current diagnostic tools.",Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment.,9913250,R01AA027916,"['Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Growth Disorders', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methylation', 'Microcephaly', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Nursery Schools', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'South Africa', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'early childhood', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gene function', 'imprint', 'infancy', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,597565,0.03438429996695895
"4/5 HEAL Consortium: Establishing Innovative Approaches  for the HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study Opioid use among pregnant women is increasing significantly, and consequently, a more than 5-fold increase in the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) has been reported since 2000. Preliminary studies show that prenatal opioid exposure is associated with increased risk of impaired neurodevelopment across cognitive, motor and behavioral domains. Therefore, studies to rigorously characterize the impacts of prenatal opioid exposure on early brain development are critically needed. In our application, five institutions (Duke University, Arkansas Children’s Research Institute, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) with complementary expertise, have formed a consortium to develop strategies to prepare for the Phase II HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study, a planned large scale multi-site research study to examine the long-term impact of prenatal drug exposure on long term childhood outcomes. Leveraging the unique skills of our multidisciplinary team, we will develop essential instruments and strategies (recruitment/retention protocols, assessment batteries, and novel tools) for the Phase II study (Aim 1). We will conduct pilot studies (fetal and postnatal imaging, advanced imaging harmonization and quality control, assessment administration, biosampling) to evaluate instruments for the Phase II study (Aim 2). Finally, we will analyze available data (Aim 3), including imaging, behavioral, cognitive and maternal data from studies focusing on early brain development, to provide critical information to guide the Phase II study design.

"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual projects.",Administrative Core of the CIFASD,9698228,U24AA014811,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data management', 'diagnostic screening', 'drinking', 'eHealth', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'forging', 'health care service', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical research', 'program dissemination', 'recruit', 'repository', 'resilience', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2019,435603,0.06260581542371363
"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,9765987,R01ES030302,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Arsenic', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cadmium', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Temperament', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'behavioral disinhibition', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early pregnancy', 'epigenetic marker', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'loss of function', 'metal poisoning', 'nanosized', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal risk factor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'tool', 'toxic metal', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,646285,0.12736317260595062
"Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria Project Summary: FASD is a serious public health crisis with 80,000 to 120,000 U.S. pregnancies per year at high risk. FASD diagnostic clinics are very sparse, difficult to sustain because of diagnostic complexity, unable to meet demand, and plagued by disagreement about diagnostic criteria. A recent comparison of five FASD diagnostic systems acknowledged that the lack of objective biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) contributes to disagreement in the field. The goal of the proposed work is to develop and refine neuroimaging methods capable of identifying subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE. A critical component of this project will be to apply these refined neuroimaging “biomarkers” to examine the validity and performance of the most commonly-used FASD diagnostic criteria (alcohol exposure, dysmorphology, growth, and cognition). The proposed project will push the development of imaging methods and will also include an examination of the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic factors. The aims are: 1) perform a comprehensive characterization of the FASD “connectome” using state-of- the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) methods in children with PAE, 2) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FASD diagnostic criteria to provide objective evaluation of FASD criteria (which remain in flux), 3) characterize relationships between connectomics and cognitive functioning, & 4) examine the developmental course of functional connectivity, white matter connectivity, cortical gyrification, and intra-cortical myelin. Participants will undergo longitudinal re-assessment at 15-months to match the new HCP-development paradigm (HCP-D) to allow for comparison to a large normative dataset being collected in Minnesota as part of the HCP-D project. We will capitalize on the developments spawned from the $40 million HCP and will benefit from evaluating the brains of children with PAE against the backdrop of a very large HCP normative dataset (n=1300). The proposed study will examine 45 participants with PAE and 45 matched controls, ages 8-16, all of whom will be evaluated by the CIFASD dysmorphology project. Participants will undergo MRI scans at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at baseline and again 15 months later. The imaging protocol, which contains very high resolution structural, diffusion- weighted, and fMRI scans will evaluate cortical gyrification, intra-cortical myelin, white matter connectivity, and functional connectivity. Data from the HCP-D project will be used as secondary “normative” comparison dataset. We expect to find a number of subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE that have not previously been observed and we will characterize individuals with these metrics. Individual identification of neurodevelopmental anomalies will then allow us to probe the screening properties of commonly used FASD diagnostic criteria and to test the performance of Dr. Mattson's Decision Tree model for rapidly identifying children with developmental effects of PAE. The study will have direct implications for FASD clinical practice and public policies as it will provide objective data about the relative advantages and disadvantages of individual diagnostic elements and it will allow for comparisons of competing FASD diagnostic systems. The proposed project aims to use the most advanced MRI brain imaging techniques available to address a highly practical problem faced by clinicians and public health officials: the lack of consensus about diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the challenges of identifying individuals who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but do not have the physical characteristics upon which a diagnosis can be made. The proposed study will identify subtle brain anomalies in children with PAE with a level of sensitivity not previously attainable. The study will push forward our understanding of how PAE negatively affects the efficiency of the brain's networks. In addition, the study will use these brain imaging results to further refine the diagnostic criteria such that more children will be able to be properly identified as having a neurodevelopmental disorder as a result of PAE.",Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria,9698862,U01AA026102,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dysmorphology', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Myelin', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'connectome', 'diffusion weighted', 'executive function', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'performance tests', 'prisma', 'processing speed', 'screening', 'white matter']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2019,347168,0.052833376085566014
"Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies Project Summary Traditionally, environmental epidemiologic studies have focused on assessing risks related to a single pollutant at a time. This, however, does not reflect reality, since we are constantly exposed to multiple pollutants at once. It is very important, therefore, to be able to assess exposure to pollutant mixtures when conducting environmental epidemiologic methods. Doing so, however, is especially challenging, mainly due to the high dimension of the multi-pollutant exposure matrix (if the exposure of interest includes more than e.g. 5 or 10 chemicals) and because these pollutants are usually very highly correlated with each other. Although some methods are available to address these issues, they usually require strong assumptions and have severe limitations. With this study we propose to bypass most of these limitations by adapting and extending a novel and robust method to assess exposure to multiple pollutants, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). We will assess the performance of PCP synthetic datasets representing multiple potential scenarios and study designs, and compare our results to those obtained by existing methods. Subsequently, we will apply PCP to three important Public Health issues, i.e. to evaluate the associations between (i) in utero exposure to a mixture of PCBs and neurodevelopment, (ii) exposure to a metals mixture and cardiovascular health, and (iii) exposure to an air pollution mixture and emergency cardiovascular admissions. Finally, we will develop and share software so other researchers can freely use this novel, robust and flexible tool across a plethora of study designs and research questions. Our proposed work will be significant as it will provide epidemiologists with a novel and robust tool to assess exposure to environmental pollutant mixtures. Project Narrative We are constantly exposed to a mixture of environmental pollutants at once, but current epidemiologic methods either assess each pollutant separately, not capturing reality, or have severe limitations. With this study we propose to adapt a wildly popular method used in computer vision applications, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), and develop flexible extensions for many epidemiologic settings. We propose to assess the performance of this method, compare with existing methods and employ in real-life applications, as well as develop and share software so other research can also use this novel, robust and flexible tool.",Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies,9617736,R01ES028805,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Educational workshop', 'Emergency Situation', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Poison', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Work', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'policy implication', 'pollutant', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,600285,0.10608900633840808
"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health.

"Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Project Summary: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Environmental exposure mixtures, especially when coupled with social stressors, have the potential to compromise developmental outcomes in children, but have been understudied. We will use a unique longitudinal dataset that tracks children from birth through early elementary school, in combination with new tools from modern data science, to disentangle the complex effects of these mixtures on educational outcomes.",Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures,9440248,R01ES028819,"['Address', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Architecture', 'Bayesian Method', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Factors', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Censuses', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Cox Models', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Gaussian model', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mothers', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nitrogen Dioxide', 'North Carolina', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Ozone', 'Particle Size', 'Particulate Matter', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pollution', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Shapes', 'Siblings', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Sulfur Dioxide', 'System', 'Taxes', 'Time', 'Unemployment', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deprivation', 'early childhood', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health care availability', 'indexing', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'pollutant', 'programs', 'rural environment', 'simulation', 'social', 'social stress', 'stressor', 'tool', 'web site']",NIEHS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,506174,0.0939979615316278
"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. The proposed program will apply a novel dental biomarker of exposure to multiple chemicals and cutting-edge statistical methods to identify specific life stages including perinatal periods that correspond to increased susceptibility to neurodevelopmental effects of metal toxicant mixtures.",Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture,9554621,R01ES026033,"['8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Arsenic', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cadmium', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Nutrient', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deciduous tooth', 'developmental neurotoxicity', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'perinatal period', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,633419,0.10406409781291674
"Spatiotemporal Risk Assessment Modeling of Chemical Mixtures Project Summary: Comprehensive exposure assessments that account for mixtures of environmental chemical pollutants are vital to understand true relationships between human exposures and disease outcomes. Moreover, human or daily mobility of people is often misrepresented by exposure models resulting in exposure misclassification. This proposal aims to determine how air pollution chemical mixtures and human mobility impact environmental and human health risk assessments, which aligns with the NIEHS core mission “to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives.” The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. The primary mentor, Dr. Kim Anderson, a professor at Oregon State University is an expert in passive exposure assessment methods and analytical quantification of chemical mixtures in environmental media, which provides an excellent environment to transition the candidate from a background in single-pollutant exposure assessment to multi-pollutant mixture exposure and risk assessment. Along with new teaching opportunities, the candidate will receive training from Dr. Anderson in research methods such as primary data collection, biochemical monitoring for epidemiological studies, and toxicology approaches in risk assessment. Collaborators Drs. Katrina Waters and Justin Teeguarden, senior scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, will provide career development advising and research training in areas such as data integration for epidemiology and toxicology studies and hands-on experience with large-scale computational resources. This proposal’s aims will address the following central hypotheses: (1) Accounting for chemical mixtures in exposure will produce synergistic health effects not observed by chemicals individually, and (2) Personal sampling and model-based exposure assessment accounting for human mobility will produce varying risk estimates depending on the pollutant and individuals’ mobility. During the K99 phase, aim 1 will collect multi-chemical air quality data for a daily time resolved stationary monitoring campaign resulting in a space and time resolved multi-pollutant (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds) air quality dataset. Aim 2 will develop spatiotemporal exposure models for gas-phase mixtures using land use regression, geostatistical, and machine learning models. In the R00 phase, aim 3 will perform a risk assessment for chemical mixtures and acute lung health effects accounting for human mobility using a case-crossover design and comparing three exposure assessment methods: traditional spatiotemporal models, spatiotemporal models accounting for human mobility, and personal exposure monitors. Together, this proposal addresses the major limitations in environmental exposure assessment, pollutant mixtures and human mobility, and is within the mixtures and air pollution focus areas of environmental exposure research at NIEHS. Project Narrative The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. This study will validate spatiotemporal statistical approaches in chemical mixture exposure modelling, evaluate the cumulative effects of chemical mixtures in air pollution and acute lung health effects, and determine the extent of exposure misclassification due to human mobility.

"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices1-4. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children5-7. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes8-10. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides11. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures12,13, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized14,15. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid16. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California17-20, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind21,22, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics23 to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,9598047,K99ES028743,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K99,2018,81281,0.11186389504436432
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9538116,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,679633,0.06696692233745705
"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett). Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It will exploit the wide availability and convenience of smartphone and tablet devices to detect the facial effects in children and adults and new ways of analyzing ultrasound images to detect facial and brain effects in the fetus.

"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9524072,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Buprenorphine', 'Calcarine Sulcus', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methadone', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'critical period', 'drug of abuse', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal drug exposure', 'fetal opioid exposure', 'illicit opioid', 'imaging modality', 'in utero', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'joint attention', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'motor control', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid use', 'opioid use in pregnancy', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prescription opioid', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'standard of care', 'visual control', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,724280,0.09452357981802266
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary This request for a renewal of funding is in response to the NIH/NIAAA funding opportunity entitled, “Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)” (RFA-AA-17-007). The overarching aim of the current proposal is to develop, validate, and implement clinically novel and innovative measurement tools to accurately identify children who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. The proposed study is relevant to the overall objective of the CIFASD funding opportunity “to accelerate specific areas of research related to the translation of new or improved capabilities in FASD clinical case recognition.” This is critical need. While there has been a concerted research effort since the initial clinical delineation of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), understanding the full spectrum of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure remains incomplete, hindering effective intervention. Although individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure may experience significantly impairing functional difficulties, identification of these individuals is inadequate. High rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis result in lost opportunities for intervention and misunderstanding of the etiology of observed difficulties. Development of accurate and specific identification tools will improve diagnostic capability and clinical decision-making regarding treatment. To this end, during previous funding periods we substantially enhanced the understanding of the specificity of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure to increase identification of alcohol-affected youth. Our hierarchical CIFASD Decision Tree, developed and validated on over 800 subjects, indicates that administration of just 4 measures can distinguish alcohol-affected youth from nonexposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions with accuracy rates of >80%. While a significant step forward, the Decision Tree was developed and validated in a research sample with a high risk of alcohol effects. One aim of the current proposal is to develop and test an electronic version of the Decision Tree (the eTree) in lower risk, international, population-based, and clinic-based samples. Another aim of the proposal, in line with the specific RFA goal to use innovative technologies to screen for dysmorphology and/or neurobehavioral deficits to aid in the identification of alcohol-exposed individuals, is the development and implementation of the FASD Online Neurobehavioral Screen (FONS), a web-based neurobehavioral assessment tool for use with subjects recruited via a web portal (cf. Foroud U01). The FONS will measure domains known to be affected in FASD, including those represented in diagnostic criteria for neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE). The eTree and the FONS will be validated using laboratory-based in-person neuropsychological assessment of children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and non-exposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions. The results of the proposed research will fulfill our research goals, improve recruitment, and most importantly accurately identify individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to improved clinical diagnosis and intervention. Project Narrative This project is directly relevant to public health concerns related to the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and improved identification of alcohol-affected individuals with novel electronic data collection techniques. Improved identification methods and delineation of features related to alcohol-exposure will ultimately lead to improved treatment and help alleviate the public health burden associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,9524819,U01AA014834,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neuropsychology', 'Online Systems', 'Outpatients', 'Persons', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Self-Administered', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Ukraine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'effective intervention', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'first grade', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'mobile application', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'novel', 'population based', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,361787,0.055544292506572855
"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research.

"Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children Maternal substance use disorders are a substantial public health concern and the neurological consequences of prenatal exposure are a major threat to the long-term health of offspring. Globally, prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is between 2-7 and 20-50 per 1000, respectively. By contrast, in certain high-risk communities in South Africa, prevalence is reported to be as high as 63 and 155 per 1000, respectively. Though prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to affect the central nervous system, to date, little data exists in respect of the impact of PAE in early childhood, before both higher-level brain networks are established and other potentially confounding post- natal environmental influences have come into play. For neurodevelopmental disorders, studies have consistently shown that early intervention, based on detection and targeted interventions, leads to better long-term outcomes. We aim to address this precise gap in knowledge by imaging the brain and 3D face across the FASD continuum to investigate early biomarkers, trajectories and functional correlates of PAE in a cohort followed prospectively from birth to age 6 years. Data: Our cohort includes a well characterized subsample of children (PAE and healthy controls) enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Health Study in Cape Town, South Africa, who have been scanned as neonates and at 2-3 years of age. Preliminary published data shows highly significant relationships between PAE and regional gray and white matter changes, already discernible in newborns, well before the age FASD is typically diagnosed. An additional longitudinal assessment at 6-years will yield a unique FASD sample with 3 distinct time points (infants, toddlers and children), allowing characterization of brain and face morphology and brain structure and function in this previously understudied early developmental period. This proposal addresses fundamental gaps concerning the presence, timing and regional specificity of altered brain morphology and structural and functional connectivity in association with the effects of PAE on the developing brain from birth to 6 years, and the relationships with facial dysmorphology. The research team has successfully gathered data from the proposed cohort as neonates and at 2–3 years of age. The benefits of extending this research to a subsequent imaging time-point, with a larger range of developmental and neurobehavioral assessments, provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine longitudinal effects of PAE on the trajectory of the developing brain in these critical early years, the links between neural and face predictors of PAE and the long-term clinical significance of these findings. This research will illuminate early neurodevelopmental mechanisms leading to subsequent behavioral and neurological disturbances, which may allow opportunities for targeting interventions when brain plasticity is still relatively fluid. This project might also lead to new strategies for early diagnosis using both face and brain biomarkers. Project Narrative Fetal exposure of the brain to alcohol can trigger brain abnormalities that unfold over a lifetime with severe consequences both for the affected individual and for society at large. To date, these brain abnormalities and associated deficits and behaviors have mostly been studied in late childhood or later, with very few studies following the consequences of well documented fetal alcohol exposure as they develop in the same individual across time in early childhood when the brain is most responsive to potential treatments. This project will extend an ongoing study of children with fetal alcohol exposure, already characterized as newborns and at age 2-3 to add assessments of the brain and behavior at age 6 and will explore alcohol-induced facial abnormalities as a complementary predictor of brain problems. !",Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children,9576322,R01AA026834,"['2 year old', '3 year old', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neonatal', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'alcohol exposure', 'antenatal', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'efficacy testing', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal alcohol use', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal depression', 'multimodality', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal exposure', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'shape analysis', 'statistics', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,237359,0.07453205105355876
"Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria Project Summary: FASD is a serious public health crisis with 80,000 to 120,000 U.S. pregnancies per year at high risk. FASD diagnostic clinics are very sparse, difficult to sustain because of diagnostic complexity, unable to meet demand, and plagued by disagreement about diagnostic criteria. A recent comparison of five FASD diagnostic systems acknowledged that the lack of objective biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) contributes to disagreement in the field. The goal of the proposed work is to develop and refine neuroimaging methods capable of identifying subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE. A critical component of this project will be to apply these refined neuroimaging “biomarkers” to examine the validity and performance of the most commonly-used FASD diagnostic criteria (alcohol exposure, dysmorphology, growth, and cognition). The proposed project will push the development of imaging methods and will also include an examination of the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic factors. The aims are: 1) perform a comprehensive characterization of the FASD “connectome” using state-of- the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) methods in children with PAE, 2) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FASD diagnostic criteria to provide objective evaluation of FASD criteria (which remain in flux), 3) characterize relationships between connectomics and cognitive functioning, & 4) examine the developmental course of functional connectivity, white matter connectivity, cortical gyrification, and intra-cortical myelin. Participants will undergo longitudinal re-assessment at 15-months to match the new HCP-development paradigm (HCP-D) to allow for comparison to a large normative dataset being collected in Minnesota as part of the HCP-D project. We will capitalize on the developments spawned from the $40 million HCP and will benefit from evaluating the brains of children with PAE against the backdrop of a very large HCP normative dataset (n=1300). The proposed study will examine 45 participants with PAE and 45 matched controls, ages 8-16, all of whom will be evaluated by the CIFASD dysmorphology project. Participants will undergo MRI scans at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at baseline and again 15 months later. The imaging protocol, which contains very high resolution structural, diffusion- weighted, and fMRI scans will evaluate cortical gyrification, intra-cortical myelin, white matter connectivity, and functional connectivity. Data from the HCP-D project will be used as secondary “normative” comparison dataset. We expect to find a number of subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE that have not previously been observed and we will characterize individuals with these metrics. Individual identification of neurodevelopmental anomalies will then allow us to probe the screening properties of commonly used FASD diagnostic criteria and to test the performance of Dr. Mattson's Decision Tree model for rapidly identifying children with developmental effects of PAE. The study will have direct implications for FASD clinical practice and public policies as it will provide objective data about the relative advantages and disadvantages of individual diagnostic elements and it will allow for comparisons of competing FASD diagnostic systems. The proposed project aims to use the most advanced MRI brain imaging techniques available to address a highly practical problem faced by clinicians and public health officials: the lack of consensus about diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the challenges of identifying individuals who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but do not have the physical characteristics upon which a diagnosis can be made. The proposed study will identify subtle brain anomalies in children with PAE with a level of sensitivity not previously attainable. The study will push forward our understanding of how PAE negatively affects the efficiency of the brain's networks. In addition, the study will use these brain imaging results to further refine the diagnostic criteria such that more children will be able to be properly identified as having a neurodevelopmental disorder as a result of PAE.",Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria,9524815,U01AA026102,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dysmorphology', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Myelin', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structural defect', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'connectome', 'diffusion weighted', 'executive function', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'performance tests', 'prisma', 'processing speed', 'screening', 'white matter']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2018,333476,0.052833376085566014
"Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies Project Summary Traditionally, environmental epidemiologic studies have focused on assessing risks related to a single pollutant at a time. This, however, does not reflect reality, since we are constantly exposed to multiple pollutants at once. It is very important, therefore, to be able to assess exposure to pollutant mixtures when conducting environmental epidemiologic methods. Doing so, however, is especially challenging, mainly due to the high dimension of the multi-pollutant exposure matrix (if the exposure of interest includes more than e.g. 5 or 10 chemicals) and because these pollutants are usually very highly correlated with each other. Although some methods are available to address these issues, they usually require strong assumptions and have severe limitations. With this study we propose to bypass most of these limitations by adapting and extending a novel and robust method to assess exposure to multiple pollutants, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). We will assess the performance of PCP synthetic datasets representing multiple potential scenarios and study designs, and compare our results to those obtained by existing methods. Subsequently, we will apply PCP to three important Public Health issues, i.e. to evaluate the associations between (i) in utero exposure to a mixture of PCBs and neurodevelopment, (ii) exposure to a metals mixture and cardiovascular health, and (iii) exposure to an air pollution mixture and emergency cardiovascular admissions. Finally, we will develop and share software so other researchers can freely use this novel, robust and flexible tool across a plethora of study designs and research questions. Our proposed work will be significant as it will provide epidemiologists with a novel and robust tool to assess exposure to environmental pollutant mixtures.

"A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture.

"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. The proposed program will apply a novel dental biomarker of exposure to multiple chemicals and cutting-edge statistical methods to identify specific life stages including perinatal periods that correspond to increased susceptibility to neurodevelopmental effects of metal toxicant mixtures.",Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture,9338255,R01ES026033,"['8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Arsenic', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cadmium', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Nutrient', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deciduous tooth', 'developmental neurotoxicity', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,648832,0.10406409781291674
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9384304,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opiates', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,704051,0.06696692233745705
"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett). Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It will exploit the wide availability and convenience of smartphone and tablet devices to detect the facial effects in children and adults and new ways of analyzing ultrasound images to detect facial and brain effects in the fetus. Our aim is to establish earlier detection so as to allow earlier intervention to improve outcome.",Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure,9391198,U01AA014809,"['3D ultrasound', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Fetus', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Neonatal', 'Nose', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pregnancy', 'Preparation', 'Printing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Syndrome', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'age group', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'caudate nucleus', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'handheld equipment', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'operation', 'postnatal', 'potential biomarker', 'prenatal', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'tobacco exposure', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,U01,2017,288909,0.06849620088612252
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary This request for a renewal of funding is in response to the NIH/NIAAA funding opportunity entitled, “Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)” (RFA-AA-17-007). The overarching aim of the current proposal is to develop, validate, and implement clinically novel and innovative measurement tools to accurately identify children who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. The proposed study is relevant to the overall objective of the CIFASD funding opportunity “to accelerate specific areas of research related to the translation of new or improved capabilities in FASD clinical case recognition.” This is critical need. While there has been a concerted research effort since the initial clinical delineation of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), understanding the full spectrum of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure remains incomplete, hindering effective intervention. Although individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure may experience significantly impairing functional difficulties, identification of these individuals is inadequate. High rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis result in lost opportunities for intervention and misunderstanding of the etiology of observed difficulties. Development of accurate and specific identification tools will improve diagnostic capability and clinical decision-making regarding treatment. To this end, during previous funding periods we substantially enhanced the understanding of the specificity of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure to increase identification of alcohol-affected youth. Our hierarchical CIFASD Decision Tree, developed and validated on over 800 subjects, indicates that administration of just 4 measures can distinguish alcohol-affected youth from nonexposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions with accuracy rates of >80%. While a significant step forward, the Decision Tree was developed and validated in a research sample with a high risk of alcohol effects. One aim of the current proposal is to develop and test an electronic version of the Decision Tree (the eTree) in lower risk, international, population-based, and clinic-based samples. Another aim of the proposal, in line with the specific RFA goal to use innovative technologies to screen for dysmorphology and/or neurobehavioral deficits to aid in the identification of alcohol-exposed individuals, is the development and implementation of the FASD Online Neurobehavioral Screen (FONS), a web-based neurobehavioral assessment tool for use with subjects recruited via a web portal (cf. Foroud U01). The FONS will measure domains known to be affected in FASD, including those represented in diagnostic criteria for neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE). The eTree and the FONS will be validated using laboratory-based in-person neuropsychological assessment of children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and non-exposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions. The results of the proposed research will fulfill our research goals, improve recruitment, and most importantly accurately identify individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to improved clinical diagnosis and intervention. Project Narrative This project is directly relevant to public health concerns related to the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and improved identification of alcohol-affected individuals with novel electronic data collection techniques. Improved identification methods and delineation of features related to alcohol-exposure will ultimately lead to improved treatment and help alleviate the public health burden associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,9391516,U01AA014834,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'California', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neuropsychology', 'Online Systems', 'Outpatients', 'Persons', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Self-Administered', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Ukraine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'effective intervention', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'first grade', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'mobile application', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'novel', 'population based', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'web portal']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,379702,0.055544292506572855
"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows Abstract: Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking. Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (PI) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals. By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 proposal builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health. In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study. Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities. Narrative: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking. Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This proposal will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",9189610,R00ES022986,"['13 year old', '4 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Burden', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'analytical tool', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deciduous tooth', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'forest', 'innovation', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'public health priorities', 'skills', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R00,2017,248999,0.14296498828852117
"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual projects.",Administrative Core of the CIFASD,9390289,U24AA014811,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data management', 'diagnostic screening', 'drinking', 'eHealth', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'forging', 'health care service', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical research', 'program dissemination', 'repository', 'resilience', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2017,401580,0.06260581542371363
"Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria Project Summary: FASD is a serious public health crisis with 80,000 to 120,000 U.S. pregnancies per year at high risk. FASD diagnostic clinics are very sparse, difficult to sustain because of diagnostic complexity, unable to meet demand, and plagued by disagreement about diagnostic criteria. A recent comparison of five FASD diagnostic systems acknowledged that the lack of objective biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) contributes to disagreement in the field. The goal of the proposed work is to develop and refine neuroimaging methods capable of identifying subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE. A critical component of this project will be to apply these refined neuroimaging “biomarkers” to examine the validity and performance of the most commonly-used FASD diagnostic criteria (alcohol exposure, dysmorphology, growth, and cognition). The proposed project will push the development of imaging methods and will also include an examination of the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic factors. The aims are: 1) perform a comprehensive characterization of the FASD “connectome” using state-of- the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) methods in children with PAE, 2) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FASD diagnostic criteria to provide objective evaluation of FASD criteria (which remain in flux), 3) characterize relationships between connectomics and cognitive functioning, & 4) examine the developmental course of functional connectivity, white matter connectivity, cortical gyrification, and intra-cortical myelin. Participants will undergo longitudinal re-assessment at 15-months to match the new HCP-development paradigm (HCP-D) to allow for comparison to a large normative dataset being collected in Minnesota as part of the HCP-D project. We will capitalize on the developments spawned from the $40 million HCP and will benefit from evaluating the brains of children with PAE against the backdrop of a very large HCP normative dataset (n=1300). The proposed study will examine 45 participants with PAE and 45 matched controls, ages 8-16, all of whom will be evaluated by the CIFASD dysmorphology project. Participants will undergo MRI scans at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at baseline and again 15 months later. The imaging protocol, which contains very high resolution structural, diffusion- weighted, and fMRI scans will evaluate cortical gyrification, intra-cortical myelin, white matter connectivity, and functional connectivity. Data from the HCP-D project will be used as secondary “normative” comparison dataset. We expect to find a number of subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE that have not previously been observed and we will characterize individuals with these metrics. Individual identification of neurodevelopmental anomalies will then allow us to probe the screening properties of commonly used FASD diagnostic criteria and to test the performance of Dr. Mattson's Decision Tree model for rapidly identifying children with developmental effects of PAE. The study will have direct implications for FASD clinical practice and public policies as it will provide objective data about the relative advantages and disadvantages of individual diagnostic elements and it will allow for comparisons of competing FASD diagnostic systems. The proposed project aims to use the most advanced MRI brain imaging techniques available to address a highly practical problem faced by clinicians and public health officials: the lack of consensus about diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the challenges of identifying individuals who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but do not have the physical characteristics upon which a diagnosis can be made. The proposed study will identify subtle brain anomalies in children with PAE with a level of sensitivity not previously attainable. The study will push forward our understanding of how PAE negatively affects the efficiency of the brain's networks. In addition, the study will use these brain imaging results to further refine the diagnostic criteria such that more children will be able to be properly identified as having a neurodevelopmental disorder as a result of PAE.",Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria,9390704,U01AA026102,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dysmorphology', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Myelin', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structural defect', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'connectome', 'diffusion weighted', 'executive function', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'performance tests', 'prisma', 'processing speed', 'screening', 'white matter']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2017,337918,0.052833376085566014
"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health.

"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows Abstract: Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking. Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (PI) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals. By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 proposal builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health. In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study. Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities. Narrative: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking. Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This proposal will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",9026614,R00ES022986,"['13 year old', '4 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Burden', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'abstracting', 'analytical tool', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deciduous tooth', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'forest', 'innovation', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'public health priorities', 'skills', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R00,2016,248999,0.14296498828852117

"Microfluidics-Enabled High-Throughput Studies on Early Embryonic Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prenatal alcohol exposure causes a range of developmental disorders that are commonly referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). The most severe case of FASDs is known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and is characterized by growth deficiencies, craniofacial malformations, and both structural and functional central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. The combination of technological limitations that decrease experimental throughput and the inherent stochasticity of biological processes eliminate the ability to gain a quantitative understanding about the onset and progression of ethanol-related developmental disorders. As a result there is not much known mechanistically about how ethanol exposure manifests as FASDs. Here, we aim to develop a microfluidic-based system that enables high-throughput and high-content studies to elucidate the effects of ethanol exposure on embryogenesis. The model organism Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) has been shown to be a model of FASDs, because Drosophila exhibits similar phenotypical defects as humans when embryos are raised on ethanol solutions. It has yet to be seen how ethanol exposure affects developmental processes that occur during embryogenesis that lead to the wide ranging symptoms of FASDs. The technological gap that precedes this is a method that can robustly expose developing fly embryos to ethanol while also allowing high-throughput live imaging and data acquisition. The objective of this project is to develop enabling technologies for whole embryo imaging to uncover the mechanisms through which embryonic ethanol exposure affects morphogenesis and developmental patterning that ultimately lead to FASDs. In order to address the technological gap we are developing a microfluidic system that can culture and expose live Drosophila embryos to ethanol in a highly-parallelized manner. This system will also enable live imaging of embryogenesis, so that we can better understand how ethanol exposure affects morphogenesis. Furthermore, the microfluidic system will be integrated with tissue clearing techniques that will enable whole embryo imaging and thus allow us to visualize whole embryo gene expression patterns. In this study, we will study mutants of key enzymes to better elucidate their roles in FASD. Using this device, I aim to better our understanding about the physical and gene expression changes involved with FASDs. Microfluidic systems will be integrated with computer automation programs that will increase data acquisition rates. Data analysis will be streamlined through the development of computer vision algorithms that will help identify phenotypical changes associated with ethanol exposure that are non-obvious and likely to be missed by manual annotation. This project will not only enlarge the repertoire of tools available for developmental biology in general, but also will have significant impact on ethanol teratology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop a high-throughput, microfluidics-based system for studying the physical and genetic origins of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). The results of this project will greatly increase our understanding of how prenatal ethanol exposure affects early embryogenesis and elucidate the mechanism through which ethanol exposure results in a wide range of developmental defects. Insights gained from this project will lead to novel treatments to help reduce ethanol teratogenicity and prevent the onset of FASDs.             ",Microfluidics-Enabled High-Throughput Studies on Early Embryonic Development,8912850,F31AA023160,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Body Size', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Congenital neurologic anomalies', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Cues', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Ethanol', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Morphogenesis', 'Nerve', 'Neuraxis', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teratogens', 'Teratology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'brain size', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'developmental genetics', 'fly', 'functional disability', 'gastrulation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'miniaturize', 'mutant', 'nervous system development', 'neuroblast', 'novel', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'synaptogenesis', 'tool']",NIAAA,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2015,37977,0.08347234818904421

"Microfluidics-Enabled High-Throughput Studies on Early Embryonic Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prenatal alcohol exposure causes a range of developmental disorders that are commonly referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). The most severe case of FASDs is known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and is characterized by growth deficiencies, craniofacial malformations, and both structural and functional central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities. The combination of technological limitations that decrease experimental throughput and the inherent stochasticity of biological processes eliminate the ability to gain a quantitative understanding about the onset and progression of ethanol-related developmental disorders. As a result there is not much known mechanistically about how ethanol exposure manifests as FASDs. Here, we aim to develop a microfluidic-based system that enables high-throughput and high-content studies to elucidate the effects of ethanol exposure on embryogenesis. The model organism Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) has been shown to be a model of FASDs, because Drosophila exhibits similar phenotypical defects as humans when embryos are raised on ethanol solutions. It has yet to be seen how ethanol exposure affects developmental processes that occur during embryogenesis that lead to the wide ranging symptoms of FASDs. The technological gap that precedes this is a method that can robustly expose developing fly embryos to ethanol while also allowing high-throughput live imaging and data acquisition. The objective of this project is to develop enabling technologies for whole embryo imaging to uncover the mechanisms through which embryonic ethanol exposure affects morphogenesis and developmental patterning that ultimately lead to FASDs. In order to address the technological gap we are developing a microfluidic system that can culture and expose live Drosophila embryos to ethanol in a highly-parallelized manner. This system will also enable live imaging of embryogenesis, so that we can better understand how ethanol exposure affects morphogenesis. Furthermore, the microfluidic system will be integrated with tissue clearing techniques that will enable whole embryo imaging and thus allow us to visualize whole embryo gene expression patterns. In this study, we will study mutants of key enzymes to better elucidate their roles in FASD. Using this device, I aim to better our understanding about the physical and gene expression changes involved with FASDs. Microfluidic systems will be integrated with computer automation programs that will increase data acquisition rates. Data analysis will be streamlined through the development of computer vision algorithms that will help identify phenotypical changes associated with ethanol exposure that are non-obvious and likely to be missed by manual annotation. This project will not only enlarge the repertoire of tools available for developmental biology in general, but also will have significant impact on ethanol teratology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop a high-throughput, microfluidics-based system for studying the physical and genetic origins of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). The results of this project will greatly increase our understanding of how prenatal ethanol exposure affects early embryogenesis and elucidate the mechanism through which ethanol exposure results in a wide range of developmental defects. Insights gained from this project will lead to novel treatments to help reduce ethanol teratogenicity and prevent the onset of FASDs.             ",Microfluidics-Enabled High-Throughput Studies on Early Embryonic Development,8721107,F31AA023160,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Body Size', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Congenital neurologic anomalies', 'Cues', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Devices', 'Dorsal', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Ethanol', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Morphogenesis', 'Nerve', 'Neuraxis', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teratogens', 'Teratology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'base', 'brain size', 'craniofacial', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'developmental genetics', 'fly', 'functional disability', 'gastrulation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malformation', 'miniaturize', 'mutant', 'nervous system development', 'neuroblast', 'novel', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'synaptogenesis', 'tool']",NIAAA,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2014,42676,0.08347234818904421
"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking.  Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (principal investigator) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting-edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals.  By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 application builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health.  In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study.  Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities.         Public Health Relevance: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking.  Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This application will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.                ","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",8566379,K99ES022986,"['13 year old', '4 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Burden', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'analytical tool', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deciduous tooth', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'forest', 'innovation', 'lead exposure', 'longitudinal design', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2013,102242,0.14225350098976106

"Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) occurs in children born to women who drink alcohol heavily during pregnancy and is one of the leading non-hereditary causes of mental retardation in the Western World. It is estimated that the prevalence of FAS in the general U.S. population is between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 births, while the undiagnosed population with variable facial and brain dysmorphology described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 10 times higher. The difficulty in the diagnosis of FASD involves misdiagnosis due to the presence or absence of the typical facial dysmorphology in association with brain dysfunction. Accurate diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of information about the contribution of dose, frequency, and timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy to variation in facial dysmorphology. In this project, a mouse model that models human consumption and is known to produce FAS-like features resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure, will be used to test the effects of differences in dose and timing of alcohol exposure on face and brain development. A combination of 3D imaging that includes Micro-video and micro-resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to capture the detailed facial structure, micro-computational tomography (Micro-CT) to capture the underlying facial bone, MRI for detailed brain dimensions, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for nerve fiber tracks in the fetal period. A novel computational program will be compiled to detect features specifically as function of alcohol exposure. The association and dissociation of facial and brain dysmorphology as a function of dose and timing of alcohol exposure will be analyzed to better inform the diagnosis of FAS/ FASD. These studies will be a collaboration sharing resources and methods and will be performed across both Basic and Clinical Science components in consortium effort. To date there is no cure for FAS/FASD, which is a life long ordeal from the birth. Experimental tests, using the above model and setting, of trophic peptides which have been known to prevent neurodegeneration in trials for Alzheimer Disease and protect cell death in embryonic stage, have been partially tested in the embryonic period to show protection against the alcohol-induced retardation. The new studies will test whether the trophic peptides can prevent alcohol-induced brain and facial dysmorphology as well as behavioral impairment known to occur in FAS.          n/a",Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies,8125102,U01AA017123,"['Adopted', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Basic Science', 'Birth', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Death', 'Child', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Dissociation', 'Dose', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early identification', 'Embryo', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Length', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'NAPVSIPQ peptide', 'Neonatal', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neurons', 'Oral', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vibrissae', 'Western World', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'behavioral impairment', 'bone', 'brain volume', 'clinical application', 'craniofacial', 'digital imaging', 'drinking', 'face bone structure', 'fetal', 'improved', 'in utero', 'longitudinal design', 'morphometry', 'morris water maze', 'mouse model', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotrophic factor', 'novel', 'peptide analog', 'postnatal', 'pregnant', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'tomography', 'translational study', 'young adult']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2011,240069,0.04524896461301303
"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          n/a",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,8121650,U01AA014835,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional status', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'alcohol testing', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal intervention', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2011,521526,0.07804072090861416
"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims.

"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          n/a",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,7900032,U01AA014835,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional status', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'alcohol testing', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal intervention', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2010,579374,0.07804072090861416
"Informatics Core for the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum disor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Informatics Core is part of the Consortium for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders"" (CIFASD). The theme of this collaborative initiative is a cross-cultural assessment of ""fetal alcohol spectrum disorder"" (FASD). The CIFASD will coordinate basic, behavioral, and clinical investigators in a multidisciplinary research project to better inform approaches aimed at developing effective intervention and treatment approaches for FASD. It will involve the input and contributions from basic researchers, behavioral scientists, and clinical investigators with the willingness to utilize novel and cutting-edge techniques so as not to simply replicate previous or ongoing work, but rather to try and move it forward in a rigorous fashion. The Informatics Core will develop and maintain the CIFASD Data Repository, which will be used to collect, maintain and distribute data generated by the various participants in the consortium. The Informatics Core will be responsible for working with the other consortium participants to define a Data Dictionary to be used in standardizing data collection, enabling the transfer of data to and from the CIFASD Data Repository, consulting on how to establish local data management systems, providing both software tools and consulting to consortium participants, and producing status reports about the progress of the various projects within the consortium. The Informatics Core draws on a wealth of resources, experience, and expertise at Indiana University in information technology infrastructure and data management, The CIFASD Data Repository will be developed on Indiana University's state-of-the-art central supercomputing facilities, taking advantage of Indiana University's strong commitment to institutional computational resources. Resources that will be used to implement the CIFASD Data Repository include multiple supercomputers, an array of readily available database and statistical software, and a high- speed, secure, robust data archiving system capable of storing duplicate copies in multiple physical locations separated by more than fifty miles. The Informatics Core will use these extraordinary computational resources to provide a single, highly secure location for consortium participants to obtain the cross-cultural data that will enable the CIFASD to meet its goals of developing novel techniques for intervention and treatment of FASD.           n/a",Informatics Core for the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum disor,7900050,U24AA014818,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Archives', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dictionary', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Location', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supercomputing', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computing resources', 'critical period', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'drinking', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'fetal', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'meetings', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'quality assurance', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'social', 'supercomputer', 'three dimensional structure', 'willingness']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,U24,2010,192573,0.03139304493655673
"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data.

"Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The main goals of this consortium are to identify sources of variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) phenotypes (facial dysmorphology, structural brain damage and neurobehavioral functional deficits), to advance understanding of structure-function relationships, to improve diagnosis and early identification of FASD, and to develop early interventions that may limit adverse outcomes in at-risk pregnancies. Animal models are essential to those goals. This project proposes a novel sheep model that is especially well suited for experimental translational studies of FASD. In utero brain development in sheep matches human brain development relatively well, and prenatal binge alcohol exposure in sheep produces brain and behavioral effects consistent with FASD. There are two long-term objectives for this project. The first is to use the sheep model to compare the effects of binge-like alcohol exposure during the period of brain development comparable to that of the human first trimester (1st-trimester mode/) with similar binge-like exposure that extends over the stages of brain development encompassing all three human trimesters (3-trimester model). These studies evaluate phenotypic measures used in the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome-growth, facial dysmorphology, and brain and behavioral development-using methods derived explicitly from and collaboratively linked directly to approaches applied in the human components of the consortium. These studies test the general hypothesis that more pervasive effects on brain and neurobehavioral development will result from binge exposure that continues after the first trimester. Aim 1 will evaluate growth, facial morphometry, and effects on in vivo brain regional volumes using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Aim 2 will assess neurobehavioral outcomes using eyeblink classical conditioning and spatial working memory. Aim 3 will assess neuroanatomical effects via neuronal counts in the cerebellum, hippocampal formation, and brainstem serotonin system. These studies are designed to inter-relate with and reciprocally inform four of the human projects [Facial Imaging (Foroud), Brain Imaging (Sowell), Neurobehavioral project (Mattson), and the Risk Factors/Nutrition project (Chambers)] and the two mouse basic science projects (Zhou; Sulik). The second objective (Aim 4) is to test the hypothesis that choline supplementation initiated periconceptually will attenuate the adverse effects of alcohol exposure in the 3-trimester sheep model. This study was designed with explicit and complementary collaboration with the choline-supplementation projects in rats [the basic science developmental project using rats (Thomas)] and in humans [Risk Factor/Nutrition project of Chambers/Keen]. This sheep model provides a unique opportunity to bridge the basic and clinical arms of the consortium more closely than has been achieved in the past.           n/a",Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01,7906056,U01AA017120,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attenuated', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Nuclei', 'Cerebellum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampal Formation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microcephaly', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serotonin', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'arm', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive control', 'conditioning', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'dentate gyrus', 'design', 'drinking', 'fetal diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'granule cell', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'morphometry', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuron loss', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'research study', 'social', 'species difference', 'three dimensional structure', 'translational study']",NIAAA,TEXAS A&M AGRILIFE RESEARCH,U01,2010,272554,0.07747733031576423
"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD. n/a",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01,7900037,U01AA017124,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Labyrinth', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menstruation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nasal septum structure', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computer generated', 'craniofacial', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'meetings', 'member', 'membranous labyrinth', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sensory system', 'social', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure', 'web site']",NIAAA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2010,242586,0.12238894865934705
"Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) occurs in children born to women who drink alcohol heavily during pregnancy and is one of the leading non-hereditary causes of mental retardation in the Western World. It is estimated that the prevalence of FAS in the general U.S. population is between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 births, while the undiagnosed population with variable facial and brain dysmorphology described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 10 times higher. The difficulty in the diagnosis of FASD involves misdiagnosis due to the presence or absence of the typical facial dysmorphology in association with brain dysfunction. Accurate diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of information about the contribution of dose, frequency, and timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy to variation in facial dysmorphology. In this project, a mouse model that models human consumption and is known to produce FAS-like features resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure, will be used to test the effects of differences in dose and timing of alcohol exposure on face and brain development. A combination of 3D imaging that includes Micro-video and micro-resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to capture the detailed facial structure, micro-computational tomography (Micro-CT) to capture the underlying facial bone, MRI for detailed brain dimensions, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for nerve fiber tracks in the fetal period. A novel computational program will be compiled to detect features specifically as function of alcohol exposure. The association and dissociation of facial and brain dysmorphology as a function of dose and timing of alcohol exposure will be analyzed to better inform the diagnosis of FAS/ FASD. These studies will be a collaboration sharing resources and methods and will be performed across both Basic and Clinical Science components in consortium effort. To date there is no cure for FAS/FASD, which is a life long ordeal from the birth. Experimental tests, using the above model and setting, of trophic peptides which have been known to prevent neurodegeneration in trials for Alzheimer Disease and protect cell death in embryonic stage, have been partially tested in the embryonic period to show protection against the alcohol-induced retardation. The new studies will test whether the trophic peptides can prevent alcohol-induced brain and facial dysmorphology as well as behavioral impairment known to occur in FAS.          n/a",Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies,7905111,U01AA017123,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Dissociation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Length', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'NAPVSIPQ peptide', 'Neonatal', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Vibrissae', 'Western World', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'behavioral impairment', 'bone', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'digital imaging', 'drinking', 'face bone structure', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'longitudinal design', 'morphometry', 'morris water maze', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotrophic factor', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'peptide analog', 'postnatal', 'pregnant', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'social', 'tomography', 'translational study', 'young adult']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2010,242494,0.04524896461301303
"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          n/a",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,7668663,U01AA014835,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional status', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'alcohol testing', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal intervention', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2009,630076,0.07804072090861416
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"" (Notice RFA-AA-03-004) to continue and expand the current multidisciplinary CIFASD. This RFA calls for, in part, research aimed at ""improved diagnosis"" and ""enhanced understanding of the domains of neurobehavioral impairment"" of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Although 30 years of research have identified myriad deficits in individuals with FASD, most neuropsychological studies are plagued by the question of global dysfunction vs. a pattern of relative sparing and impaired function. Delineation of a neuropsychological profile has been the subject of much recent debate. Limited research, including the current CIFASD consortium, has examined if prenatal alcohol exposure results in general dysfunction or a more specific neurobehavioral profile of strengths and weaknesses. The primary aim of this project is to determine whether a neurobehavioral phenotype exists in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, whether the same phenotype exists in children with FASD who lack facial dysmorphology, and whether the phenotype can be used for differential diagnosis. Secondary aims, involving collaboration with other CIFASD projects and cores, are to determine the relationship between brain dysmorphology, facial dysmorphology, and neurobehavioral function. These aims are in keeping with the overall aims of the CIFASD, including enhanced understanding of the neurobehavioral phenotype and establishment of standardized diagnostic criteria and methods of assessment of FASD. A standard neurobehavioral protocol will be administered to four groups of children at six sites and will address the functional domains of executive function, working memory, verbal function, and psychological symptomatology. In addition to children with FASD and nonexposed controls, children with low IQ scores or ADHD will be included as contrast samples. Using this heterogeneous sample and multivariate statistical methods, neurobehavioral profile specific to FASD will be sought. In addition, participants will be assessed using methodology prescribed by the Dysmorphology Core and the facial and brain imaging projects of the CIFASD. Data from three broad domains (neurobehavior, dysmorphology, and brain morphology and function) will be analyzed both separately and together to address the main aim of the CIFASD: improving the diagnostic criteria for FASD. This project is directly relevant to public health concerns surrounding the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, improving diagnosis of alcohol-affected individuals, and defining the profile of neurobehavioral effects that are specific to FASD.

"Dysmorphology Core - U24    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 1973 when the specific pattern of malformation referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) was first delineated, it has become clear that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with a broad spectrum of structural anomalies as well as neurobehavioral deficits now referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). However, the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol is unknown and the incidence of specific anomalies or clusters of anomalies associated with specific patterns of prenatal alcohol consumption are poorly understood. Over the previous three years of the Consortium, the Dysmorphology Core has established a standard comprehensive protocol for physical evaluation of children in order to assure consistency in identification of the broad spectrum of features that constitute FASD at all sites. We propose to continue to support these activities throughout the renewal period in children during the first year of life at Consortium sites in prospective studies in Moscow Region, Russia, and Rivne, Ukraine as well as in older children in retrospective studies in Los Angeles, CA, San Diego, CA, Albuquerque, NM, the Northern Plains states, Atlanta, GA, and Cape Town, South Africa. Identification of large numbers of children at various ages with FAS as well as those with some features of the disorder but not enough to presently qualify them for that diagnosis (FASD), each of whom has received a standardized clinical examination, as well as neurobehavioral evaluation, neuroimaging studies, 3D photographs and, in the prospective studies, prenatal ultrasound studies, will provide the opportunity to address hypotheses regarding the relationship between FASD-related structural defects identified through the standard physical examination with complementary diagnostic methods that are being tested in other Consortium projects. The specific aims of this project are to assure consistency as well as accuracy in recognition of FASD at all CIFASD project sites where children are being evaluated; to delineate the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol in order to determine the boundaries that encompass FASD in prospective as well as retrospective studies involved in the Consortium; to identify specific structural features or clusters of features that are predictive of or correlated with deficits in neurobehavioral development across developmental ages spanning from infancy to adolescence; to correlate the specific structural features or clusters of features identified on the CIFASD standard physical examination with alternative or complementary methods that are being tested in other CIFASD projects; and to better understand the extent to which structural features of FASD are related to specific defects in the development of the brain.          n/a",Dysmorphology Core - U24,7668725,U24AA014815,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Examination', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuroimaging', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pediatrician', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2009,162359,0.03973706778328151
"Informatics Core for the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum disor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Informatics Core is part of the Consortium for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders"" (CIFASD). The theme of this collaborative initiative is a cross-cultural assessment of ""fetal alcohol spectrum disorder"" (FASD). The CIFASD will coordinate basic, behavioral, and clinical investigators in a multidisciplinary research project to better inform approaches aimed at developing effective intervention and treatment approaches for FASD. It will involve the input and contributions from basic researchers, behavioral scientists, and clinical investigators with the willingness to utilize novel and cutting-edge techniques so as not to simply replicate previous or ongoing work, but rather to try and move it forward in a rigorous fashion. The Informatics Core will develop and maintain the CIFASD Data Repository, which will be used to collect, maintain and distribute data generated by the various participants in the consortium. The Informatics Core will be responsible for working with the other consortium participants to define a Data Dictionary to be used in standardizing data collection, enabling the transfer of data to and from the CIFASD Data Repository, consulting on how to establish local data management systems, providing both software tools and consulting to consortium participants, and producing status reports about the progress of the various projects within the consortium.

"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.           n/a","Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)",7668683,U01AA017122,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disorder by Site', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Productivity', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain size', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'disability', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2009,488655,0.07884904727743647
"Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The main goals of this consortium are to identify sources of variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) phenotypes (facial dysmorphology, structural brain damage and neurobehavioral functional deficits), to advance understanding of structure-function relationships, to improve diagnosis and early identification of FASD, and to develop early interventions that may limit adverse outcomes in at-risk pregnancies. Animal models are essential to those goals. This project proposes a novel sheep model that is especially well suited for experimental translational studies of FASD. In utero brain development in sheep matches human brain development relatively well, and prenatal binge alcohol exposure in sheep produces brain and behavioral effects consistent with FASD. There are two long-term objectives for this project. The first is to use the sheep model to compare the effects of binge-like alcohol exposure during the period of brain development comparable to that of the human first trimester (1st-trimester mode/) with similar binge-like exposure that extends over the stages of brain development encompassing all three human trimesters (3-trimester model). These studies evaluate phenotypic measures used in the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome-growth, facial dysmorphology, and brain and behavioral development-using methods derived explicitly from and collaboratively linked directly to approaches applied in the human components of the consortium. These studies test the general hypothesis that more pervasive effects on brain and neurobehavioral development will result from binge exposure that continues after the first trimester. Aim 1 will evaluate growth, facial morphometry, and effects on in vivo brain regional volumes using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Aim 2 will assess neurobehavioral outcomes using eyeblink classical conditioning and spatial working memory. Aim 3 will assess neuroanatomical effects via neuronal counts in the cerebellum, hippocampal formation, and brainstem serotonin system. These studies are designed to inter-relate with and reciprocally inform four of the human projects [Facial Imaging (Foroud), Brain Imaging (Sowell), Neurobehavioral project (Mattson), and the Risk Factors/Nutrition project (Chambers)] and the two mouse basic science projects (Zhou; Sulik). The second objective (Aim 4) is to test the hypothesis that choline supplementation initiated periconceptually will attenuate the adverse effects of alcohol exposure in the 3-trimester sheep model. This study was designed with explicit and complementary collaboration with the choline-supplementation projects in rats [the basic science developmental project using rats (Thomas)] and in humans [Risk Factor/Nutrition project of Chambers/Keen]. This sheep model provides a unique opportunity to bridge the basic and clinical   arms of the consortium more closely than has been achieved in the past.           n/a",Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01,7669196,U01AA017120,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attenuated', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Nuclei', 'Cerebellum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampal Formation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microcephaly', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serotonin', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Upper arm', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive control', 'conditioning', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'dentate gyrus', 'design', 'drinking', 'fetal diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'granule cell', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'morphometry', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuron loss', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'research study', 'social', 'species difference', 'three dimensional structure', 'translational study']",NIAAA,TEXAS A&M AGRILIFE RESEARCH,U01,2009,267924,0.07747733031576423
"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD.           n/a",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01,7668689,U01AA017124,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Labyrinth', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menstruation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nasal septum structure', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computer generated', 'craniofacial', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'meetings', 'member', 'membranous labyrinth', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sensory system', 'social', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure', 'web site']",NIAAA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2009,237539,0.12238894865934705
"Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) occurs in children born to women who drink alcohol heavily during pregnancy and is one of the leading non-hereditary causes of mental retardation in the Western World. It is estimated that the prevalence of FAS in the general U.S. population is between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 births, while the undiagnosed population with variable facial and brain dysmorphology described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 10 times higher. The difficulty in the diagnosis of FASD involves misdiagnosis due to the presence or absence of the typical facial dysmorphology in association with brain dysfunction. Accurate diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of information about the contribution of dose, frequency, and timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy to variation in facial dysmorphology. In this project, a mouse model that models human consumption and is known to produce FAS-like features resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure, will be used to test the effects of differences in dose and timing of alcohol exposure on face and brain development. A combination of 3D imaging that includes Micro-video and micro-resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to capture the detailed facial structure, micro-computational tomography (Micro-CT) to capture the underlying facial bone, MRI for detailed brain dimensions, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for nerve fiber tracks in the fetal period. A novel computational program will be compiled to detect features specifically as function of alcohol exposure. The association and dissociation of facial and brain dysmorphology as a function of dose and timing of alcohol exposure will be analyzed to better inform the diagnosis of FAS/ FASD. These studies will be a collaboration sharing resources and methods and will be performed across both Basic and Clinical Science components in consortium effort. To date there is no cure for FAS/FASD, which is a life long ordeal from the birth. Experimental tests, using the above model and setting, of trophic peptides which have been known to prevent neurodegeneration in trials for Alzheimer Disease and protect cell death in embryonic stage, have been partially tested in the embryonic period to show protection against the alcohol-induced retardation. The new studies will test whether the trophic peptides can prevent alcohol-induced brain and facial dysmorphology as well as behavioral impairment known to occur in FAS.          n/a",Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies,7668687,U01AA017123,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Dissociation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Length', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'NAPVSIPQ peptide', 'Neonatal', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Vibrissae', 'Western World', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'behavioral impairment', 'bone', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'digital imaging', 'drinking', 'face bone structure', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'longitudinal design', 'morphometry', 'morris water maze', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotrophic factor', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'peptide analog', 'postnatal', 'pregnant', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'social', 'tomography', 'translational study', 'young adult']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2009,237808,0.04524896461301303

The overarching goals of this project are to: Goal 1: improve understanding of the dysmorphic features in FAS and FASD; Goal 2: enhance the capability for definitive diagnosis of FAS and the broader spectrum of FASD at different stages of the lifespan; and Goal 3: establish whether there is a relationship between FAS and FASD dysmorphic features and the specific underlying impairments in brain function.           n/a",3D Facial Imaging in FASD (U01),7502720,U01AA014809,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'disorder control', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'success', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2008,341942,0.040456261311722023
"Dysmorphology Core - U24    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 1973 when the specific pattern of malformation referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) was first delineated, it has become clear that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with a broad spectrum of structural anomalies as well as neurobehavioral deficits now referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). However, the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol is unknown and the incidence of specific anomalies or clusters of anomalies associated with specific patterns of prenatal alcohol consumption are poorly understood. Over the previous three years of the Consortium, the Dysmorphology Core has established a standard comprehensive protocol for physical evaluation of children in order to assure consistency in identification of the broad spectrum of features that constitute FASD at all sites. We propose to continue to support these activities throughout the renewal period in children during the first year of life at Consortium sites in prospective studies in Moscow Region, Russia, and Rivne, Ukraine as well as in older children in retrospective studies in Los Angeles, CA, San Diego, CA, Albuquerque, NM, the Northern Plains states, Atlanta, GA, and Cape Town, South Africa. Identification of large numbers of children at various ages with FAS as well as those with some features of the disorder but not enough to presently qualify them for that diagnosis (FASD), each of whom has received a standardized clinical examination, as well as neurobehavioral evaluation, neuroimaging studies, 3D photographs and, in the prospective studies, prenatal ultrasound studies, will provide the opportunity to address hypotheses regarding the relationship between FASD-related structural defects identified through the standard physical examination with complementary diagnostic methods that are being tested in other Consortium projects. The specific aims of this project are to assure consistency as well as accuracy in recognition of FASD at all CIFASD project sites where children are being evaluated; to delineate the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol in order to determine the boundaries that encompass FASD in prospective as well as retrospective studies involved in the Consortium; to identify specific structural features or clusters of features that are predictive of or correlated with deficits in neurobehavioral development across developmental ages spanning from infancy to adolescence; to correlate the specific structural features or clusters of features identified on the CIFASD standard physical examination with alternative or complementary methods that are being tested in other CIFASD projects; and to better understand the extent to which structural features of FASD are related to specific defects in the development of the brain.          n/a",Dysmorphology Core - U24,7502755,U24AA014815,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'All Sites', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Examination', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuroimaging', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2008,159503,0.03973706778328151
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"" (Notice RFA-AA-03-004) to continue and expand the current multidisciplinary CIFASD. This RFA calls for, in part, research aimed at ""improved diagnosis"" and ""enhanced understanding of the domains of neurobehavioral impairment"" of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Although 30 years of research have identified myriad deficits in individuals with FASD, most neuropsychological studies are plagued by the question of global dysfunction vs. a pattern of relative sparing and impaired function. Delineation of a neuropsychological profile has been the subject of much recent debate. Limited research, including the current CIFASD consortium, has examined if prenatal alcohol exposure results in general dysfunction or a more specific neurobehavioral profile of strengths and weaknesses. The primary aim of this project is to determine whether a neurobehavioral phenotype exists in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, whether the same phenotype exists in children with FASD who lack facial dysmorphology, and whether the phenotype can be used for differential diagnosis. Secondary aims, involving collaboration with other CIFASD projects and cores, are to determine the relationship between brain dysmorphology, facial dysmorphology, and neurobehavioral function. These aims are in keeping with the overall aims of the CIFASD, including enhanced understanding of the neurobehavioral phenotype and establishment of standardized diagnostic criteria and methods of assessment of FASD. A standard neurobehavioral protocol will be administered to four groups of children at six sites and will address the functional domains of executive function, working memory, verbal function, and psychological symptomatology. In addition to children with FASD and nonexposed controls, children with low IQ scores or ADHD will be included as contrast samples. Using this heterogeneous sample and multivariate statistical methods, neurobehavioral profile specific to FASD will be sought. In addition, participants will be assessed using methodology prescribed by the Dysmorphology Core and the facial and brain imaging projects of the CIFASD. Data from three broad domains (neurobehavior, dysmorphology, and brain morphology and function) will be analyzed both separately and together to address the main aim of the CIFASD: improving the diagnostic criteria for FASD. This project is directly relevant to public health concerns surrounding the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, improving diagnosis of alcohol-affected individuals, and defining the profile of neurobehavioral effects that are specific to FASD. Improved identification and delineation of these features will ultimately lead to improved treatment.           n/a",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,7502760,U01AA014834,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plague', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'statistics', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2008,651718,0.06713335861649028
"Informatics Core for the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum disor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Informatics Core is part of the Consortium for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders"" (CIFASD). The theme of this collaborative initiative is a cross-cultural assessment of ""fetal alcohol spectrum disorder"" (FASD). The CIFASD will coordinate basic, behavioral, and clinical investigators in a multidisciplinary research project to better inform approaches aimed at developing effective intervention and treatment approaches for FASD. It will involve the input and contributions from basic researchers, behavioral scientists, and clinical investigators with the willingness to utilize novel and cutting-edge techniques so as not to simply replicate previous or ongoing work, but rather to try and move it forward in a rigorous fashion. The Informatics Core will develop and maintain the CIFASD Data Repository, which will be used to collect, maintain and distribute data generated by the various participants in the consortium. The Informatics Core will be responsible for working with the other consortium participants to define a Data Dictionary to be used in standardizing data collection, enabling the transfer of data to and from the CIFASD Data Repository, consulting on how to establish local data management systems, providing both software tools and consulting to consortium participants, and producing status reports about the progress of the various projects within the consortium. The Informatics Core draws on a wealth of resources, experience, and expertise at Indiana University in information technology infrastructure and data management, The CIFASD Data Repository will be developed on Indiana University's state-of-the-art central supercomputing facilities, taking advantage of Indiana University's strong commitment to institutional computational resources. Resources that will be used to implement the CIFASD Data Repository include multiple supercomputers, an array of readily available database and statistical software, and a high- speed, secure, robust data archiving system capable of storing duplicate copies in multiple physical locations separated by more than fifty miles.

"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.           n/a","Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)",7502725,U01AA017122,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disorder by Site', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Productivity', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain size', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'disability', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'human study', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2008,474412,0.07884904727743647
"Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The main goals of this consortium are to identify sources of variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) phenotypes (facial dysmorphology, structural brain damage and neurobehavioral functional deficits), to advance understanding of structure-function relationships, to improve diagnosis and early identification of FASD, and to develop early interventions that may limit adverse outcomes in at-risk pregnancies. Animal models are essential to those goals. This project proposes a novel sheep model that is especially well suited for experimental translational studies of FASD. In utero brain development in sheep matches human brain development relatively well, and prenatal binge alcohol exposure in sheep produces brain and behavioral effects consistent with FASD. There are two long-term objectives for this project. The first is to use the sheep model to compare the effects of binge-like alcohol exposure during the period of brain development comparable to that of the human first trimester (1st-trimester mode/) with similar binge-like exposure that extends over the stages of brain development encompassing all three human trimesters (3-trimester model). These studies evaluate phenotypic measures used in the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome-growth, facial dysmorphology, and brain and behavioral development-using methods derived explicitly from and collaboratively linked directly to approaches applied in the human components of the consortium. These studies test the general hypothesis that more pervasive effects on brain and neurobehavioral development will result from binge exposure that continues after the first trimester. Aim 1 will evaluate growth, facial morphometry, and effects on in vivo brain regional volumes using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Aim 2 will assess neurobehavioral outcomes using eyeblink classical conditioning and spatial working memory. Aim 3 will assess neuroanatomical effects via neuronal counts in the cerebellum, hippocampal formation, and brainstem serotonin system. These studies are designed to inter-relate with and reciprocally inform four of the human projects [Facial Imaging (Foroud), Brain Imaging (Sowell), Neurobehavioral project (Mattson), and the Risk Factors/Nutrition project (Chambers)] and the two mouse basic science projects (Zhou; Sulik). The second objective (Aim 4) is to test the hypothesis that choline supplementation initiated periconceptually will attenuate the adverse effects of alcohol exposure in the 3-trimester sheep model. This study was designed with explicit and complementary collaboration with the choline-supplementation projects in rats [the basic science developmental project using rats (Thomas)] and in humans [Risk Factor/Nutrition project of Chambers/Keen].

"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD.           n/a",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01,7502729,U01AA017124,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emotional', 'End Point', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Labyrinth', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menstruation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nasal septum structure', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Week', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computer generated', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'day', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'membranous labyrinth', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sensory system', 'size', 'social', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2008,234161,0.12238894865934705
"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          n/a",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,7502741,U01AA014835,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Coordination and Collaboration', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gender Role', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Micronutrients', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Numbers', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional status', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patient currently pregnant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Sudden infant death syndrome', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translational Research', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'absorption', 'alcohol consumption during pregnancy', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'alcohol testing', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'cohort', 'compare effectiveness', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'performance site', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal intervention', 'processing speed', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'social', 'stillbirth', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2008,690277,0.07804072090861416
"Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) occurs in children born to women who drink alcohol heavily during pregnancy and is one of the leading non-hereditary causes of mental retardation in the Western World. It is estimated that the prevalence of FAS in the general U.S. population is between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 births, while the undiagnosed population with variable facial and brain dysmorphology described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 10 times higher. The difficulty in the diagnosis of FASD involves misdiagnosis due to the presence or absence of the typical facial dysmorphology in association with brain dysfunction. Accurate diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of information about the contribution of dose, frequency, and timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy to variation in facial dysmorphology. In this project, a mouse model that models human consumption and is known to produce FAS-like features resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure, will be used to test the effects of differences in dose and timing of alcohol exposure on face and brain development. A combination of 3D imaging that includes Micro-video and micro-resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to capture the detailed facial structure, micro-computational tomography (Micro-CT) to capture the underlying facial bone, MRI for detailed brain dimensions, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for nerve fiber tracks in the fetal period. A novel computational program will be compiled to detect features specifically as function of alcohol exposure. The association and dissociation of facial and brain dysmorphology as a function of dose and timing of alcohol exposure will be analyzed to better inform the diagnosis of FAS/ FASD. These studies will be a collaboration sharing resources and methods and will be performed across both Basic and Clinical Science components in consortium effort. To date there is no cure for FAS/FASD, which is a life long ordeal from the birth. Experimental tests, using the above model and setting, of trophic peptides which have been known to prevent neurodegeneration in trials for Alzheimer Disease and protect cell death in embryonic stage, have been partially tested in the embryonic period to show protection against the alcohol-induced retardation. The new studies will test whether the trophic peptides can prevent alcohol-induced brain and facial dysmorphology as well as behavioral impairment known to occur in FAS.          n/a",Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies,7502713,U01AA017123,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Bone and Cartilage Funding', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'CDKN1A gene', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Consumption', 'Count', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disruption', 'Dissociation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Length', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'NAPVSIPQ peptide', 'Neonatal', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient currently pregnant', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Vibrissae', 'Western World', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'day', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'drinking', 'face bone structure', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'human study', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'morphometry', 'morris water maze', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotrophic factor', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'oncoprotein p21', 'peptide analog', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'social', 'tomography', 'translational study', 'young adult']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2008,235382,0.04524896461301303
"3D Facial Imaging in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the past three years, members of the Facial Imaging Core have worked with the Consortium to apply novel methods to more effectively diagnose FAS using 3D images from an ethnically diverse sample. These data and their subsequent analyses were used to identify features which consistently and reliably distinguished individuals with a clinical diagnosis of FAS from controls. Based on the initial success of the 'Facial Imaging Core', we now propose an expanded series of aims to be part of a clinical project named '3D Facial Imaging in FASD'. Subsequent work proposed in this study will build on the lessons learned in this first phase of research and utilize improved technology and sampling procedures to extend the diagnostic utility of these novel techniques to a wider range of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure or FASD. In collaboration with several clinical projects, we will collect a longitudinal, multi-ethnic sample of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol. This sample will allow us to reliably separate the effects of ethnic variation and developmental age from those due to alcohol exposure. We will also continue to work with the basic science projects to ensure that results in the different species (human, mouse, sheep) are used to inform analyses in each project. The overarching goals of this project are to: Goal 1: improve understanding of the dysmorphic features in FAS and FASD; Goal 2: enhance the capability for definitive diagnosis of FAS and the broader spectrum of FASD at different stages of the lifespan; and Goal 3: establish whether there is a relationship between FAS and FASD dysmorphic features and the specific underlying impairments in brain function.           n/a",3D Facial Imaging in FASD (U01),7342564,U01AA014809,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'disorder control', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'success', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2007,359361,0.040456261311722023
"Dysmorphology Core - U24    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since 1973 when the specific pattern of malformation referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) was first delineated, it has become clear that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with a broad spectrum of structural anomalies as well as neurobehavioral deficits now referred to as the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). However, the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol is unknown and the incidence of specific anomalies or clusters of anomalies associated with specific patterns of prenatal alcohol consumption are poorly understood. Over the previous three years of the Consortium, the Dysmorphology Core has established a standard comprehensive protocol for physical evaluation of children in order to assure consistency in identification of the broad spectrum of features that constitute FASD at all sites. We propose to continue to support these activities throughout the renewal period in children during the first year of life at Consortium sites in prospective studies in Moscow Region, Russia, and Rivne, Ukraine as well as in older children in retrospective studies in Los Angeles, CA, San Diego, CA, Albuquerque, NM, the Northern Plains states, Atlanta, GA, and Cape Town, South Africa. Identification of large numbers of children at various ages with FAS as well as those with some features of the disorder but not enough to presently qualify them for that diagnosis (FASD), each of whom has received a standardized clinical examination, as well as neurobehavioral evaluation, neuroimaging studies, 3D photographs and, in the prospective studies, prenatal ultrasound studies, will provide the opportunity to address hypotheses regarding the relationship between FASD-related structural defects identified through the standard physical examination with complementary diagnostic methods that are being tested in other Consortium projects. The specific aims of this project are to assure consistency as well as accuracy in recognition of FASD at all CIFASD project sites where children are being evaluated; to delineate the full range of structural anomalies in children prenatally exposed to alcohol in order to determine the boundaries that encompass FASD in prospective as well as retrospective studies involved in the Consortium; to identify specific structural features or clusters of features that are predictive of or correlated with deficits in neurobehavioral development across developmental ages spanning from infancy to adolescence; to correlate the specific structural features or clusters of features identified on the CIFASD standard physical examination with alternative or complementary methods that are being tested in other CIFASD projects; and to better understand the extent to which structural features of FASD are related to specific defects in the development of the brain.          n/a",Dysmorphology Core - U24,7345662,U24AA014815,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'All Sites', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Examination', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuroimaging', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,U24,2007,153891,0.03973706778328151
"Informatics Core for the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum disor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Informatics Core is part of the Consortium for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders"" (CIFASD). The theme of this collaborative initiative is a cross-cultural assessment of ""fetal alcohol spectrum disorder"" (FASD). The CIFASD will coordinate basic, behavioral, and clinical investigators in a multidisciplinary research project to better inform approaches aimed at developing effective intervention and treatment approaches for FASD. It will involve the input and contributions from basic researchers, behavioral scientists, and clinical investigators with the willingness to utilize novel and cutting-edge techniques so as not to simply replicate previous or ongoing work, but rather to try and move it forward in a rigorous fashion. The Informatics Core will develop and maintain the CIFASD Data Repository, which will be used to collect, maintain and distribute data generated by the various participants in the consortium. The Informatics Core will be responsible for working with the other consortium participants to define a Data Dictionary to be used in standardizing data collection, enabling the transfer of data to and from the CIFASD Data Repository, consulting on how to establish local data management systems, providing both software tools and consulting to consortium participants, and producing status reports about the progress of the various projects within the consortium. The Informatics Core draws on a wealth of resources, experience, and expertise at Indiana University in information technology infrastructure and data management, The CIFASD Data Repository will be developed on Indiana University's state-of-the-art central supercomputing facilities, taking advantage of Indiana University's strong commitment to institutional computational resources. Resources that will be used to implement the CIFASD Data Repository include multiple supercomputers, an array of readily available database and statistical software, and a high- speed, secure, robust data archiving system capable of storing duplicate copies in multiple physical locations separated by more than fifty miles.

"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"" (Notice RFA-AA-03-004) to continue and expand the current multidisciplinary CIFASD. This RFA calls for, in part, research aimed at ""improved diagnosis"" and ""enhanced understanding of the domains of neurobehavioral impairment"" of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Although 30 years of research have identified myriad deficits in individuals with FASD, most neuropsychological studies are plagued by the question of global dysfunction vs. a pattern of relative sparing and impaired function. Delineation of a neuropsychological profile has been the subject of much recent debate. Limited research, including the current CIFASD consortium, has examined if prenatal alcohol exposure results in general dysfunction or a more specific neurobehavioral profile of strengths and weaknesses. The primary aim of this project is to determine whether a neurobehavioral phenotype exists in children with fetal alcohol syndrome, whether the same phenotype exists in children with FASD who lack facial dysmorphology, and whether the phenotype can be used for differential diagnosis. Secondary aims, involving collaboration with other CIFASD projects and cores, are to determine the relationship between brain dysmorphology, facial dysmorphology, and neurobehavioral function. These aims are in keeping with the overall aims of the CIFASD, including enhanced understanding of the neurobehavioral phenotype and establishment of standardized diagnostic criteria and methods of assessment of FASD. A standard neurobehavioral protocol will be administered to four groups of children at six sites and will address the functional domains of executive function, working memory, verbal function, and psychological symptomatology. In addition to children with FASD and nonexposed controls, children with low IQ scores or ADHD will be included as contrast samples. Using this heterogeneous sample and multivariate statistical methods, neurobehavioral profile specific to FASD will be sought. In addition, participants will be assessed using methodology prescribed by the Dysmorphology Core and the facial and brain imaging projects of the CIFASD. Data from three broad domains (neurobehavior, dysmorphology, and brain morphology and function) will be analyzed both separately and together to address the main aim of the CIFASD: improving the diagnostic criteria for FASD. This project is directly relevant to public health concerns surrounding the effects of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure, improving diagnosis of alcohol-affected individuals, and defining the profile of neurobehavioral effects that are specific to FASD. Improved identification and delineation of these features will ultimately lead to improved treatment.           n/a",A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders,7343382,U01AA014834,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plague', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'social', 'statistics', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2007,740297,0.06713335861649028
"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.           n/a","Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)",7343320,U01AA017122,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disorder by Site', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Productivity', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain size', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'disability', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'human study', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2007,496998,0.07884904727743647
"Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The main goals of this consortium are to identify sources of variation in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) phenotypes (facial dysmorphology, structural brain damage and neurobehavioral functional deficits), to advance understanding of structure-function relationships, to improve diagnosis and early identification of FASD, and to develop early interventions that may limit adverse outcomes in at-risk pregnancies. Animal models are essential to those goals. This project proposes a novel sheep model that is especially well suited for experimental translational studies of FASD. In utero brain development in sheep matches human brain development relatively well, and prenatal binge alcohol exposure in sheep produces brain and behavioral effects consistent with FASD. There are two long-term objectives for this project. The first is to use the sheep model to compare the effects of binge-like alcohol exposure during the period of brain development comparable to that of the human first trimester (1st-trimester mode/) with similar binge-like exposure that extends over the stages of brain development encompassing all three human trimesters (3-trimester model). These studies evaluate phenotypic measures used in the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome-growth, facial dysmorphology, and brain and behavioral development-using methods derived explicitly from and collaboratively linked directly to approaches applied in the human components of the consortium. These studies test the general hypothesis that more pervasive effects on brain and neurobehavioral development will result from binge exposure that continues after the first trimester. Aim 1 will evaluate growth, facial morphometry, and effects on in vivo brain regional volumes using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Aim 2 will assess neurobehavioral outcomes using eyeblink classical conditioning and spatial working memory. Aim 3 will assess neuroanatomical effects via neuronal counts in the cerebellum, hippocampal formation, and brainstem serotonin system. These studies are designed to inter-relate with and reciprocally inform four of the human projects [Facial Imaging (Foroud), Brain Imaging (Sowell), Neurobehavioral project (Mattson), and the Risk Factors/Nutrition project (Chambers)] and the two mouse basic science projects (Zhou; Sulik). The second objective (Aim 4) is to test the hypothesis that choline supplementation initiated periconceptually will attenuate the adverse effects of alcohol exposure in the 3-trimester sheep model. This study was designed with explicit and complementary collaboration with the choline-supplementation projects in rats [the basic science developmental project using rats (Thomas)] and in humans [Risk Factor/Nutrition project of Chambers/Keen]. This sheep model provides a unique opportunity to bridge the basic and clinical   arms of the consortium more closely than has been achieved in the past.           n/a",Translational Studies of FASD Using a Sheep Model-U01,7343058,U01AA017120,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attenuated', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Nuclei', 'Cerebellum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Condition', 'Count', 'Data', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampal Formation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microcephaly', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serotonin', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Upper arm', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive control', 'conditioning', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'dentate gyrus', 'design', 'drinking', 'fetal diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'granule cell', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'morphometry', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neuron loss', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'social', 'species difference', 'three dimensional structure', 'translational study']",NIAAA,TEXAS AGRILIFE RESEARCH,U01,2007,267087,0.07747733031576423
"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD.           n/a",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01,7343348,U01AA017124,"['3-Dimensional', 'A Mouse', 'Acoustic Nerve', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Emotional', 'End Point', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fertilization', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Fiber', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Labyrinth', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Menstruation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nasal septum structure', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'New Mexico', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Week', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'computer generated', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'day', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'high throughput screening', 'human data', 'human study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'literacy', 'malformation', 'member', 'membranous labyrinth', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sensory system', 'size', 'social', 'symposium', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2007,225000,0.12238894865934705
"Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), first described in the U.S. in 1973 by Jones and Smith, encompasses a pattern of structural abnormalities, growth deficiency, and neurobehavioral impairment that occurs in the offspring of women who consume moderate to heavy amounts of alcohol in pregnancy. FASD is thought to represent the leading known preventable causes of neurobehavioral impairment in the U.S. and perhaps throughout the world. The proposed study offers the opportunity within the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) consortium of projects to describe the spectrum of alcoholrelated effects, to identify risk factors that are antecedent to pregnancy outcome, to test within-pregnancy interventions, and also to test methods that will allow for earlier identification of alcohol-related birth outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research will utilize a prospective cohort study design involving pregnant women and their offspring recruited in Russia and Ukraine to address major gaps in knowledge about FASD by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1) to more fully delineate the complete range of expression of FASD in relation to specific quantities, patterns and gestational timing of alcohol exposure, and to evaluate the sensitivity of methods for earlier recognition of affected children; 2) to assess the contribution of maternal nutritional status in relation to physical and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, and to test the benefit of maternal second and third trimester supplementation with multinutrients with or without choline with respect to risk for FASD in the offspring; and 3) in collaboration with other CIFASD investigators, to provide a well-characterized sample of mothers/children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol for testing of alternative and earlier methods of identifying affected children, including prenatal ultrasound and post-natal 3D facial imaging. The proposed research has public health relevance from the standpoint of providing an improved estimate of the magnitude and scope of alcoholrelated developmental problems in the context of specific quantities and patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure using standardized methods for assessment, and from the standpoint of developing and validating critically necessary clinical methods for improved and early recognition of affected children and testing the potential benefit of a reasonably applied prenatal intervention that may help ameliorate negative outcomes.          n/a",Spectrum of and Nutritional Risk Factors for FASD in Russia and Ukraine,7343353,U01AA014835,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Coordination and Collaboration', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetus', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gender Role', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Micronutrients', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Numbers', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional status', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patient currently pregnant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Russia', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Sudden infant death syndrome', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translational Research', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'absorption', 'alcohol consumption during pregnancy', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'alcohol testing', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'cognitive control', 'cohort', 'compare effectiveness', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'drinking', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'performance site', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal intervention', 'processing speed', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'social', 'stillbirth', 'three dimensional structure']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,U01,2007,656344,0.07804072090861416
"Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) occurs in children born to women who drink alcohol heavily during pregnancy and is one of the leading non-hereditary causes of mental retardation in the Western World. It is estimated that the prevalence of FAS in the general U.S. population is between 0.5 and 2.0 per 1,000 births, while the undiagnosed population with variable facial and brain dysmorphology described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is estimated to be 10 times higher. The difficulty in the diagnosis of FASD involves misdiagnosis due to the presence or absence of the typical facial dysmorphology in association with brain dysfunction. Accurate diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of information about the contribution of dose, frequency, and timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy to variation in facial dysmorphology. In this project, a mouse model that models human consumption and is known to produce FAS-like features resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure, will be used to test the effects of differences in dose and timing of alcohol exposure on face and brain development. A combination of 3D imaging that includes Micro-video and micro-resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to capture the detailed facial structure, micro-computational tomography (Micro-CT) to capture the underlying facial bone, MRI for detailed brain dimensions, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for nerve fiber tracks in the fetal period. A novel computational program will be compiled to detect features specifically as function of alcohol exposure. The association and dissociation of facial and brain dysmorphology as a function of dose and timing of alcohol exposure will be analyzed to better inform the diagnosis of FAS/ FASD. These studies will be a collaboration sharing resources and methods and will be performed across both Basic and Clinical Science components in consortium effort. To date there is no cure for FAS/FASD, which is a life long ordeal from the birth. Experimental tests, using the above model and setting, of trophic peptides which have been known to prevent neurodegeneration in trials for Alzheimer Disease and protect cell death in embryonic stage, have been partially tested in the embryonic period to show protection against the alcohol-induced retardation. The new studies will test whether the trophic peptides can prevent alcohol-induced brain and facial dysmorphology as well as behavioral impairment known to occur in FAS.          n/a",Mouse Model Neuro-Facial Dysmorphology: Tanslational and Treatment Studies,7343333,U01AA017123,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Bone and Cartilage Funding', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'CDKN1A gene', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Consumption', 'Count', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disruption', 'Dissociation', 'Dose', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Emotional', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Length', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Retardation', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'NAPVSIPQ peptide', 'Neonatal', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'New Mexico', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient currently pregnant', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sheep', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Vibrissae', 'Western World', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain volume', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'craniofacial', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'day', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'drinking', 'face bone structure', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'human study', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'literacy', 'morphometry', 'morris water maze', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotrophic factor', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'oncoprotein p21', 'peptide analog', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'social', 'tomography', 'translational study', 'young adult']",NIAAA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,U01,2007,224838,0.04524896461301303
"Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Project summary Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure, occur in up to 5% of the population in the United States, and are associated with lifelong disability. There are multiple difficulties in obtaining an accurate diagnosis of FASD, including subtlety of physical features and heterogeneity in presentation. Consequently, FASD is grossly under-recognized, and the majority of affected children never receive a diagnosis. If FASD could be diagnosed earlier and with more reliability, many years of beneficial intervention would not be lost. The objective of this research is to apply machine learning to high-dimensional data in well-characterized data sets to predict or characterize children with FASD. The central hypothesis of this research is that the application of machine learning will accurately predict and recognize FASD compared with expert clinical diagnosis. To test this hypothesis, machine learning will be employed to: 1) characterize FASD based on the presence of non-cardinal malformations, 2) establish multivariate predictors of FASD in preschool aged children, and 3) identify diagnosis specific neurodevelopmental markers that distinguish alcohol related neurodevelopmental deficits from neurodevelopmental deficits without prenatal exposure. Two secondary data sources will be used in this proposal; a prospective study of 400 pregnant women and their offspring in Ukraine (half of whom consumed high amounts of alcohol) with full clinical evaluations for FASD, and a cross- sectional study of over 2,900 first grade children in four regions of the U.S., all with clinical FASD evaluations. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, the expected contribution is for more accurate prediction and recognition of children with FASD. The proposed research is innovative, as it represents a departure from current practice by incorporating machine learning techniques into predictive models of FASD. As a perinatal epidemiologist, I have a strong foundation in analytic techniques, and the advanced training in machine learning will further enhance these skills. Additionally, the disease-focused training in dysmorphology and neurodevelopment will provide a strong foundation to make significant contributions to the field of FASD research. Finally, training and mentoring in grant writing and the responsible conduct of research will provide a strong foundation to transition to an independent researcher. This proposed research builds on previous NIAAA funded research by my interdisciplinary mentoring team, who are all strongly supportive of this research and training plan. This seminal application of machine learning to FASD research will demonstrate its capacity to predict and identify affected children, ultimately leading to earlier intervention of children prenatally exposed to alcohol. Narrative Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are common and result in lifelong disabilities; however, they are clini- cally difficult to identify, and the vast majority of children with FASD are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The proposed research will leverage recent advances in machine learning to better identify children with FASD. These advances would lead to earlier identification and intervention in the lives of children prenatally exposed to alcohol, which can improve their developmental outcomes.",Applying Machine Learning in the Prediction and Identification of Children Affected by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure,10018803,K01AA027811,"['Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Nursery Schools', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ukraine', 'United States', 'Writing', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aged', 'alcohol exposure', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'disability', 'fetal diagnosis', 'first grade', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malformation', 'multidimensional data', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel strategies', 'offspring', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'research clinical testing', 'responsible research conduct', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'success']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K01,2020,172808,0.016974912797826376
"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9999949,R00ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'adverse birth outcomes', 'base', 'big-data science', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data types', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'random forest', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2020,247463,0.12708383827027345
"BRINGING MODERN DATA SCIENCE TOOLS TO BEAR ON ENVIRONMENTAL MIXTURES Project Summary: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied.

"Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology OVERALL : ABSTRACT This is the third competing continuation for an accomplished Environmental Health Sciences Core Center (EHS CC), The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The Director is Trevor M. Penning, PhD (The Thelma Brown and Henry Charles Molinoff Professor of Pharmacology) and the Deputy Director is Rebecca A. Simmons, MD (The Hallam Hurt Endowed Professor in Pediatrics). The Center is comprised of 71 members from 18 Departments and 5 Schools, with almost equal representation of basic and clinician-scientists drawn from the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The CEET has built an institutional, regional and national identity in environmental health sciences (EHS) in the absence of a School of Public Health and Department of EHS at Penn. The synergistic combination of basic and clinician-scientists within the CEET promotes translational environmental health research that addresses fundamental questions and translates knowledge into action to have a major impact on human health and disease consistent with the NIEHS Strategic Plan. The CEET mission is to “elucidate the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and human disease, and translate findings into action to improve the health of vulnerable individuals, and local, national, and global communities”. This mission is accomplished through five aims. In Aim 1: We use a flexible thematic area structure to conduct translational environmental health research to improve precision public health. Our current themes are in Air Pollution & Lung Health; Environmental Exposures & Cancer; Windows-of- Susceptibility; and Environmental Neuroscience. Each thematic area integrates the pillars or exposure science, adverse outcome constructs (pathways and networks) to explain the phenome with translation to communities and human subjects. In Aim 2: We conduct bi-directional communication with communities in S.E and N.E. Pennsylvania and use community engagement to set the research agenda for the CEET. In Aim 3: We provide a facility core structure to promote precision public health. Our Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core is adept in human subject study design and in conducting population exposure services, using cartographic modeling, GIS tools and biosensors. Biomarkers of exposure and effect are measured in our Translational Biomarker Core which conducts mass spectrometric assays at a level of precision and accuracy difficult to emulate elsewhere. The Exposure Biology Informatics Core brings to bear the power of computation, machine learning and AI to predict the toxicity of unknowns and integrate Big-data sets to recognize patterns in “omics” data and predict adverse outcomes. In Aim 4: We build capacity in environmental health sciences by funding pilot projects to Early Stage Investigators (ESI) and to senior investigators conducting environmental health research for the first time. In Aim 5: We cultivate the careers of ESI through a transformative Environmental Health Scientist Support Program that provides mentoring, grant proposal review, environmental health and Facility Core workshops. OVERALL : NARRATIVE The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) conducts research that links environmental exposures, to adverse outcomes and translates its findings to human subjects and communities to identify the most vulnerable and improve prevention, intervention and treatment through precision public health.

"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health.

"Role of the gut microbiome in pesticide-induced effects on child neurodevelopment SUMMARY Pesticides are pervasive in our environment, and have accumulated in drinking water reserves serving millions of people worldwide, causing growing concern since the potential adverse health effects are not fully understood. In 2017 alone, the world used about 6.8 million tons of pesticides, of which the world's largest usage is in China and the United States. More recently it has been discovered that pesticides have strong effects on microbial communities, extinguishing entire clades while promoting growth in others. Shifts in microbial composition have been associated with brain development, mood and behavior suggesting a strong link between the gut and the brain. We hypothesize that there may exist an unappreciated microbiome component to the adverse health effects of pesticide exposure. In this proposal, we will use a comprehensive approach to identify the microbial components of pesticide susceptibility to neurodevelopmental delay. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to 11 targeted pesticides on child neurodevelopment in a large well-defined human Mother and Child Microbiome Cohort (MCMC) consisting of 3000 mother and child pairs. Study participants are currently followed up regularly until the children reach 4 years of age. Comprehensive artificial intelligence analysis of pesticide exposure and children's early neurodevelopment data will identify key pesticides that negatively impact child development. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that prenatal exposure to pesticides can shift the composition of the GM and subsequently lead to abnormal neurodevelopment. We will integrate the child gut microbiome data with maternal pesticide exposure during pregnancy and child neurodevelopment data to investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to targeted pesticides on child gut microbiome and development. This Aim will identify specific gut bacteria or clades associated with child neurodevelopment. In Aim 3, we will use conventional and germ-free mouse models to elucidate mechanisms by which pesticide exposure can affect the gut microbiome and behavior. Conventionally housed pregnant mice will be exposed to pesticides and the gut microbiome and behavior (anxiety, memory, motor performance, social interaction) will be analyzed in their offspring. Also, germ-free mice will be colonized with specific bacteria or bacterial clades to study the causality of the impact of the GM on behavior. The long-term implications for human health are significant – it may be possible to increase tolerance/robustness to pesticide exposure by providing sensitive individuals with probiotics that have select degradation pathways. Moreover, this understanding is important in order to formulate novel preventive strategies including educating health practitioners, families, and public health providers and organizations regarding the potential risks of environmental exposures. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chemical and toxic substances, such as herbicides and pesticides pose some of the most common threats to environmental and human health. Our studies are designed to identify effects of prenatal pesticide exposure on child neurodevelopment and the role of the gut microbiome in mediating pesticide-induced adverse health effects. Findings of our study will ultimately result in precision risk assessment and precision prevention strategies to improve human health worldwide.",Role of the gut microbiome in pesticide-induced effects on child neurodevelopment,9879567,R01ES031322,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', '4 year old', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrazine', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Degradation Pathway', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diet', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Family health status', 'Food Supply', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Herbicides', 'Human', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Insecticides', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Paraquat', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pentachlorophenol', 'Performance', 'Pesticides', 'Phenotype', 'Phorate', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Poison', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevention strategy', 'Probiotics', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Serum', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Water Supply', 'acaricide', 'biological systems', 'body system', 'brain tissue', 'carcinogenesis', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'drinking water', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'glyphosate', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'health organization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'individualized prevention', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome components', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome sequencing', 'motor behavior', 'mouse model', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pesticide exposure', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal environmental exposure', 'prenatal exposure', 'recruit', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'sample collection', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2020,282150,0.06810345813298556
"Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal and postnatal childhood exposure to metals, essential and non-essential, is ubiquitous via dietary and environmental sources. Heavy metals, including lead and methylmercury, are well characterized as potent neurotoxicants, associated with lower cognition and poor learning abilities. Yet, our understanding of the neurotoxicity and joint impact of many other common prenatal and postnatal metal exposures remains extremely limited. Even less is known about the combined impact of exposure to multiple metals during fetal development or postnatal exposure during early childhood, or the influence of other environmental mixtures such as nutrients, which may have shared sources, on the neurodevelopmental effects of metals. To address this significant gap, our long-term goal is to quantify the neurocognitive impact of ubiquitous prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and identify cord blood DNA methylation biomarkers that can reconstruct prenatal environmental exposures and predict future neurocognitive development in children. We will test if objective measures of key prenatal maternal nutrients, such as folate, vitamin B12 and essential metals attenuate or mitigate the neurotoxicity of metal mixtures. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage resources from an established U.S. pre-birth cohort, Project Viva. In this cohort, we have measured concentrations for 14 prenatal maternal metals in the first trimester of pregnancy and blood samples collected in early-childhood (~3 years) ready for metal testing as well as ready to use genome-wide cord blood DNA methylation screens. Children have been followed prospectively and undergone detail testing for neurodevelopment in early (~3 years of age) and mid-childhood (~7 years). We hypothesize that prenatal maternal 1st trimester and postnatal early childhood neurotoxic metal mixtures are associated with poor neurodevelopment in early and mid-childhood (Aim 1), and that prenatal first trimester maternal plasma folate, vitamin B12 and blood concentration of essential metals protect against prenatal metal mixture neurotoxicity (Aim 2). We also hypothesize that DNA methylation marks measured in umbilical cord blood at birth can reconstruct prenatal exposure to metals (Aim 3.a) and that cord blood DNAm marks predict future neurocognitive development in early and mid-childhood (Aim 3.b). By testing longitudinal associations in a large cohort of children with detail cognitive assessments as well as objective biomarkers of metals and nutrients, we will overcome limitations currently faced by existing studies testing few exposures simultaneously. We will use novel statistical methodology to model prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and machine learning algorithms to build epigenetic predictors of exposure and neurodevelopment. This research will provide a comprehensive quantification of the cognitive burden of prenatal and postnatal mixtures, the development of biomarkers of exposure and neurodevelopment and the identification of potential prenatal nutritional intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood decrements in neurocognitive development result in large population burden and expenditure. The proposed research will identify the extent to which prenatal and postnatal neurotoxic mixtures as well as key prenatal nutrients jointly influence neurocognitive development in childhood. This research will provide early life biomarkers that reconstruct prenatal exposures and predict childhood neurocognitive performance with the goal of developing novel and early-life interventions to protect children.",Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers,9882859,R01ES031259,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood specimen', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Neurotoxicity', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Consequentialism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expenditure', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Folic Acid', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vitamin B 12', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'biomarker development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive load', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'early childhood', 'exposed human population', 'genome-wide', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'learning ability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'methylation biomarker', 'neurocognitive test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurodevelopmental effect', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal environmental exposure', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'routine screening', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,438331,0.15295240851834843
"Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development Project Summary/Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include multiple classes of chemicals that have been used extensively in consumer products. Mounting evidence from toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest EDCs are developmental neurotoxicants, and EDC exposure during the critical in utero period is associated with adverse child cognitive development. Unfortunately, current research focuses on individual EDCs and largely ignores joint and interactive effects of EDCs and the overall effect of the EDC mixture. To assess exposure to multiple EDCs simultaneously, one must consider the high dimensionality of the exposure matrix and the complex correlation structures across chemicals in statistical analyses. To address limitations of existing methods, we propose to adapt a robust technique that is well-established for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We specifically aim to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a type of robust Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization, to determine the patterns of exposure to four ubiquitous classes of EDCs known to cross the placenta—polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols (e.g., bisphenol A), and phthalates—and to characterize the relationship between these exposure patterns and cognitive development. LDA is empirically-driven so that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the number of patterns, and the non-negativity constraint enhances the interpretability of the patterns identified. For our health model, we will use a supervised approach that allows child cognitive scores to inform the LDA solution, thereby enabling identification of patterns most relevant to the outcome. We will conduct this work using the existing infrastructure of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study, a longitudinal birth cohort of mother-child dyads. We will also establish reproducibility of the method by creating a user-friendly R package so that other researchers can easily apply LDA in environmental epidemiology, and we will verify transferability and functionality of the method on a separate cohort. This will be the first study to assess the interacting and overall effects of multiple EDCs on child cognitive development, introducing LDA as a straight-forward tool for the analysis of complex mixtures in epidemiology. If successful, this method has broader implications for environmental epidemiology, as it can easily be applied to other environmental mixtures of interest. The activities encompassed by this proposal (study design, data management, advanced statistics, machine learning, data science, and presentation of findings) cover the set of fundamental research skills required by a scientist entering the interdisciplinary field of environmental epidemiology in the era of Big Data and Precision Public Health. The applied experience gained from carrying out this research, in combination with didactic training and individual cross-disciplinary mentoring, comprises a comprehensive research training plan that will serve as a platform from which to launch a career as an independent investigator in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative This study will be the first to determine existing patterns of cross-class endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in utero and to evaluate their association with child cognitive development, assessing potentially non- linear independent effects, non-additive interactions, and the overall effect of the mixture. This will help to identify environmental risk factors most amenable to public health interventions and inform future researchers and policy makers about concurrent exposure to EDCs in a vulnerable population The adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for pattern identification and dimension reduction in environmental epidemiology integrates data science and machine learning into environmental health research, which is novel and extremely relevant to public health, as LDA can be easily applied to other environmental mixtures and co-exposures of interest.",Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development,9893708,F31ES030263,"['Address', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cosmetics', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Flame Retardants', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Paint', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenols', 'Placenta', 'Plastics', 'Policy Maker', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Urine', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'consumer product', 'data management', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fundamental research', 'health of the mother', 'high dimensionality', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'modifiable risk', 'multiple datasets', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'pollutant', 'polybrominated diphenyl ether', 'prenatal exposure', 'public health intervention', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2020,32095,0.09125216890124757
"The Impact of Air Pollution Exposure on COVID-19 Severity and Mortality PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently the most emergent public health disaster of the entire world. COVID-19 disproportionately affects older adults, people having history of smoking and comorbidities like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. There is no vaccine and treatment for COVID-19, therefore, public health interventions have been taken to control disease transmission. Also, searching modifiable environmental factors that can help reduce the COVID-19 severity and mortality is crucial. Air pollution exposure has been shown to have a systemic effect on the human body including lung function impairment and immune alterations. Recent two ecologic studies from Europe and the United States have suggested that higher long-term ambient air pollution exposure (PM2.5 and NO2) significantly contributes to the COVID-19 mortality. These findings from aggregated data of air pollution exposure and total number of deaths in large geographic areas need to be further verified by cohort study with individual data of air pollution exposure and COVID-19 case progression and mortality. Also, susceptibility factors such as low social economic status (SES), race/ethnicity, smoking exposures and comorbidities need to be accounted for in the analysis. To address the urgent public health question about the role of air pollution exposure in COVID-19 progression, we propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study based on the existing EMR data of all COVID- 19 cases (n>7000) diagnosed at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) medical centers. Specific aims of this proposal have been expanded from our ongoing NIEHS-supported R01 study investigating prenatal air pollution exposure and children's autism risk among 440,000 KPSC mother-child pairs (APAR study, 1R01ES029963). In this proposal, the main outcomes of interest are COVID-19 severity assessed by hospitalization, ICU admission and ventilator use, as well as death. Details dates will be available through EMR. Natural language processing technologies will be applied to identify the date of first COVID-19 symptom onset for each case. Thereafter, the earliest date among COVID-19 symptom onset and clinical diagnosis will be used as the study entry date. Then short- and long-term air pollution exposure will be estimated for each case by averaging air pollution exposure levels during one-month and one-year before the study entry date. Both ambient (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3) and traffic-related (line dispersion model estimated NOx) air pollution exposure will be assessed based on individual residential addresses. Detailed residential history of all KPSC members have been well-maintained by the KPSC system. Key covariates including age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking exposure, body mass index, comorbidities, medication use, and meteorological data will be extracted to control for confounding and identify susceptible high risk subgroups. With the unique cohort data resource and world-renowned epidemiologists and exposure scientists, this one-year study will greatly enhance our knowledge about the effect of air pollution exposure on COVID-19 progression and death. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study is proposed in response to the urgent need of large cohort studies investigating the contributions of environment such as air pollution exposure to the COVID-19 epidemic and mortality. The study is very likely to have a high impact on identifying key environmental factors that can prevent or ameliorate COVID-19 progression.",The Impact of Air Pollution Exposure on COVID-19 Severity and Mortality,10152911,R01ES029963,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Animals', 'Asthma', 'Body mass index', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Fatality Rates', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'China', 'Chronic', 'Cities', 'Cohort Studies', 'Coronavirus', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Europe', 'Exposure to', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Humidity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Meteorology', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Design', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Severities', 'Smoking', 'Smoking History', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Ventilator', 'Virus', 'ambient air pollution', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'coarse particles', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data resource', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'fine particles', 'high risk', 'interest', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel coronavirus', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'public health intervention', 'respiratory infection virus', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'traffic-related air pollution']",NIEHS,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,670296,0.07868000670176586
"A Multisite Neurobehavioral Assessment of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Project Summary This request for a renewal of funding is in response to the NIH/NIAAA funding opportunity entitled, “Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)” (RFA-AA-17-007). The overarching aim of the current proposal is to develop, validate, and implement clinically novel and innovative measurement tools to accurately identify children who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. The proposed study is relevant to the overall objective of the CIFASD funding opportunity “to accelerate specific areas of research related to the translation of new or improved capabilities in FASD clinical case recognition.” This is critical need. While there has been a concerted research effort since the initial clinical delineation of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), understanding the full spectrum of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure remains incomplete, hindering effective intervention. Although individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure may experience significantly impairing functional difficulties, identification of these individuals is inadequate. High rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis result in lost opportunities for intervention and misunderstanding of the etiology of observed difficulties. Development of accurate and specific identification tools will improve diagnostic capability and clinical decision-making regarding treatment. To this end, during previous funding periods we substantially enhanced the understanding of the specificity of effects of prenatal alcohol exposure to increase identification of alcohol-affected youth. Our hierarchical CIFASD Decision Tree, developed and validated on over 800 subjects, indicates that administration of just 4 measures can distinguish alcohol-affected youth from nonexposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions with accuracy rates of >80%. While a significant step forward, the Decision Tree was developed and validated in a research sample with a high risk of alcohol effects. One aim of the current proposal is to develop and test an electronic version of the Decision Tree (the eTree) in lower risk, international, population-based, and clinic-based samples. Another aim of the proposal, in line with the specific RFA goal to use innovative technologies to screen for dysmorphology and/or neurobehavioral deficits to aid in the identification of alcohol-exposed individuals, is the development and implementation of the FASD Online Neurobehavioral Screen (FONS), a web-based neurobehavioral assessment tool for use with subjects recruited via a web portal (cf. Foroud U01). The FONS will measure domains known to be affected in FASD, including those represented in diagnostic criteria for neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE). The eTree and the FONS will be validated using laboratory-based in-person neuropsychological assessment of children with histories of prenatal alcohol exposure and non-exposed controls with and without behavioral concerns or conditions. The results of the proposed research will fulfill our research goals, improve recruitment, and most importantly accurately identify individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to improved clinical diagnosis and intervention.

"Cardiovascular health and exposure to PM2.5 constituents: a multi-cohort study Project Summary Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the primary cause of death and a major cause of years of life lost in the US and in the world. Cohort studies conducted in North America and Europe have provided crucial information in identifying exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as a cause of increased CVD risks. They have also pointed out important directions for future research, including the differential toxicity of PM2.5 chemical constituents to CVD incidence, the shape of concentration-response (C-R) functions, impact of exposure time windows and indoor air pollution exposure. The objectives of our study are to assess the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and incident CVD, and investigate the impact of exposure time window and indoor air pollution on these associations. Approach. We will conduct a retrospective multi-cohort study in China using personal health records from five national cohorts with adjudicated CVD endpoints maintained by the Fuwai Hospital. To provide individual-level exposure trajectories for ~120,000 cohort participants during their follow-up period, we will develop an ensemble machine learning model using ground air quality measurements, satellite data, and air quality model simulations to generate 1 km resolution national PM2.5 mass and major constituent (sulfates, nitrates, elemental carbon, organic carbon, lead, and nickel) exposure estimates between 1998 and 2020 (Aim 1). Using cohort data from 2007 to 2020 for our main analyses, we will use Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the associations of long-term exposures to PM2.5 constituents and adverse cardiovascular outcomes including total CVD, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke (Aim 2). Variations of this model will be used to investigate the shape of the C-R functions (linear vs. non-linear) as well as the impact of exposure errors using exposure estimates between 1998 and 2020 (Aim 2a). We will also examine windows of susceptibility for CVD endpoints using both time-variant and time- invariant exposure metrics (Aim 2b). Finally, we will evaluate the confounding effect of indoor air pollution on the C-R functions using a sub-cohort with estimated personal PM2.5 exposure estimates based on Fuwai Hospital's ongoing Multi-Region Panel Study (Aim 2c). Expected Results. Given the tremendous variability in PM2.5 constituent concentrations in China over time and space, our findings will contribute new PM2.5 constituent-specific C-R functions in CVD burden calculation in both the US and the world. Our study will also expand our knowledge on important factors affecting these associations such as exposure window and indoor air pollution. Narrative This study will assess the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in a retrospective multi-cohort study. Usinig five national cohorts and multi-city indoor air pollution measurements in China, we will investigate the shape of the CVD concentration-response functions and the impacts of indoor air pollution and exposure windows. The findings of this study will provide additional scientific support for designing effective policy and public health actions to lower the CVD burden in both the US and China.",Cardiovascular health and exposure to PM2.5 constituents: a multi-cohort study,10034502,R01ES032140,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Caliber', 'Carbon', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Cities', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Concentration measurement', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Outcome', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Heavy Metals', 'Hospitals', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Indoor Air Pollution', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meteorology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nickel', 'Nitrates', 'North America', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Particulate Matter', 'Personal Health Records', 'Policies', 'Pollution', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Shapes', 'Stroke', 'Sulfate', 'Supercomputing', 'Tennessee', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urbanization', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'ambient air pollution', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'fine particles', 'follow-up', 'insight', 'land use', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'particle', 'response', 'study population', 'years of life lost']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,615182,0.05485270609700605
"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,10238415,R00ES028743,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Wind', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'indexing', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R00,2020,248998,0.11507650742592843
"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett). Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It will exploit the wide availability and convenience of smartphone and tablet devices to detect the facial effects in children and adults and new ways of analyzing ultrasound images to detect facial and brain effects in the fetus. Our aim is to establish earlier detection so as to allow earlier intervention to improve outcome.",Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure,9927955,U01AA014809,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', '3D ultrasound', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Fetus', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Neonatal', 'Nose', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pregnancy', 'Preparation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Syndrome', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'age group', 'alcohol exposure', 'algorithm development', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'caudate nucleus', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'handheld equipment', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse model', 'neonatal period', 'novel', 'operation', 'postnatal', 'potential biomarker', 'prenatal', 'prenatal testing', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'tobacco exposure']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,U01,2020,234498,0.06849620088612252
"Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater Project Summary / Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a naturally-occurring metal contaminant found in water supplies throughout the world. Although research using small samples (< 400 observations) from Bangladesh, China and Canada suggests that excessive consumption of Mn is neurotoxic in infants and young children, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) classifies Mn only as a secondary contaminant. Thus, Mn is not subject to mandatory monitoring in public water systems, let alone private wells, which serve over 2 million Californians while remaining unregulated and untreated. To reconcile the gap between epidemiological evidence and regulatory action, we propose this timely research. Our project, which takes California’s private wells as a focal point for its investigation, has three specific aims: to identify (1) areas at high risk of exposure to Mn in drinking water (2) the socioeconomic characteristics of communities at high-risk of Mn exposure, and (3) the degree of association between Mn exposure and the health outcomes of infants and young children. While treatment for Mn-contaminated water is technologically straightforward, access may depend on a community’s socioeconomic and political status; thus, there is danger of Mn silently amplifying health inequalities. The ​broader, long-term objectives of this research are (I) to encourage further analyses of Mn exposure in California by developing a statewide publicly-available dataset from groundwater Mn data, and (II) to develop a ​causal ​framework for a primary-sample study of Mn effects on infant and child health. California enforces the US EPA’s secondary contaminant standard of 50 µg L​-1 but only in community water systems. Non-transient, non-community water systems (e.g. schools and hospitals) and private wells are exempt. In recent years, the US Geological Survey (USGS) has found Mn concentrations above the health-based target of 300 µg L​-1 in California’s wells. ​The proposed research will indicate whether and to what extent Mn affects child health and contributes to health disparities. As such, it is aligned with the NIEHS mission to determine how environmental exposures affect humans in order to promote healthier lives. To achieve the first aim of identifying areas at high risk of exposure to unsafe concentrations of Mn, we will use a machine learning model on subsurface flow and groundwater chemistry to predict Mn concentrations in the Central Valley, Los Angeles, Central Coast and West Coast Basins; then, we will overlay the Mn prediction grid with ZIP code and school district polygons to identify the areas that emerge with more than a 50% chance of exposure to Mn at the secondary standard as high-risk. For the second aim, we will determine if high-risk areas are distinguished from low-risk areas by their socioeconomic status and demographics using two-sample t-tests. For the third aim, we will run least squares regressions of birth weight, grade-by-school test scores and chronic absenteeism rates on predicted Mn exposure with controls for chemical confounds, socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics. Project Narrative The impact of manganese (Mn) on population health is an under-investigated problem in the United States relative to the wide prevalence and frequent detections of the chemical above safe concentrations in groundwater basins throughout the country. In line with NIEHS priorities to better understand environmental health disparities and to aid in securing environmental justice, we propose to correct this knowledge gap by undertaking a substantial investigation into the prevalence of Mn in California’s private wells, and examining the shared characteristics of communities most likely to be exposed to unsafe levels of manganese in drinking water. By also performing a preliminary investigation of the relationship between Mn exposure and child cognitive health, our study will provide an initial assessment of the public health threat from Mn, highlight the most vulnerable communities, and inform regulatory agencies seeking to review drinking water standards for Mn.",Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater,9978510,R21ES030807,"['Absenteeism', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Asia', 'Bangladesh', 'Birth Weight', 'California', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'China', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disadvantaged', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Esthetics', 'Exposure to', 'Geological Survey', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impaired health', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Maps', 'Metals', 'Micronutrients', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Vital Statistics', 'Water', 'Water Supply', 'base', 'contaminated water', 'demographics', 'drinking water', 'econometrics', 'elementary school', 'environmental justice', 'ethnic minority population', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'ground water', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'infant outcome', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'school district', 'socioeconomics', 'web site']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE,R21,2020,224680,0.06556216673876944
"Effect of complex mixtures on oxidative stress and cognition in children ABSTRACT In many areas of the world, children are regularly exposed to environmental chemicals. During any given period of life, children will experience exposure to many chemicals at the same time. The effects of such mixtures of chemicals on the molecular underpinnings of the disease process, such as oxidative stress (OS) or on functional endpoints such as cognitive functions, are not well understood in children. There is also little understating of the extent to which endogenous antioxidant defenses in children's bodies or exogenous antioxidants buffer the effects of chemical mixtures on children's health. The few studies on this topic to date have been mostly cross-sectional or limited to small numbers of chemicals. To address these gaps, the proposed study will leverage the Salud Ambiental Montevideo (SAM) cohort in Uruguay, which has enrolled 679 1st-grade children between years 2012-19. Currently, children range in age 7-15 years and have been followed-up for 0-5 years, depending on year of enrollment. Exposure to chlorpyrifos and pyrethroids pesticides has been characterized in a sub-sample of children using urinary metabolites of the pesticides. Exposure to metals in this cohort is generally low. In a cross-sectional pilot study of SAM participants, a metal mixture was linked to higher levels of oxidative DNA damage and with lower performance on a test of general cognitive abilities. The proposed study will consist of 3 years of follow-up of SAM children to annually characterize the levels of metals in blood and urine, and metabolites of chlorpyrifos, pyrethroids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in urine. Each year, urinary biomarkers of OS (F2-isoprostane and 8-OHdG), serum antioxidant enzymes (GPx and PON1), and serum antioxidant vitamins (vitamin C, carotenoids, retinol, etc). will be measured. A sub-sample of ~100 children will participate in a year-long intensive (monthly) assessment of OS biomarkers to characterize short-term fluctuations in biomarkers and their biological predictors. Children will complete assessments of executive functions (EF) in Y2 and Y3 of the study. Leveraging data collected at enrollment into SAM (T0, ~7y), chemical mixtures will be constructed in statistical machine learning models for four time points: T0 and Y1-3 of the proposed study. These mixtures will be modeled to understand how exposure to mixtures over time is associated with OS and EF. Potential effect modification by antioxidants will be tested. The proposed activities align with the 2018-23 NIEHS strategic plan of research on the exposome to promote human health through the advancement of environmental health sciences. Specifically, they will: 1) advance the basic understanding of short (1 yr) and medium-term (3 yrs) fluctuations in biomarkers of OS and antioxidant defenses, which have not been investigated in children; 2) contribute to understanding of the extent to which chemical mixtures in early-middle childhood affect a molecular process (OS) thought to underlie the development of chronic disease, as well as functional endpoints that underlie children's learning and social interactions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Throughout their lives, children are exposed to many different chemicals but our understanding of the effects of these mixtures on child health is limited. Our research is relevant to public health: it will inform prevention efforts and communication of risks by creating a deeper understanding of how exposure to chemical mixtures affects oxidative stress and cognition in children and how well the body's antioxidant defenses are able to counteract these effects. Our work is also relevant to the mission of the NIEHS: it will contribute fundamental knowledge on environmental influences on disease.",Effect of complex mixtures on oxidative stress and cognition in children,10072546,R01ES031411,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'All-Trans-Retinol', 'Antioxidants', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Arylesterase', 'Ascorbic Acid', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Buffers', 'Carotenoids', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'F2-Isoprostanes', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Income', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Memory', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Pesticides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Serum', 'Social Interaction', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tocopherols', 'Urine', 'Uruguay', 'Vitamins', 'Work', 'aged', 'antioxidant enzyme', 'aryldialkylphosphatase', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'early adolescence', 'environmental chemical', 'enzyme activity', 'executive function', 'experience', 'first grade', 'follow-up', 'glutathione peroxidase', 'improved functioning', 'individual variation', 'middle childhood', 'oxidative DNA damage', 'pyrethroid', 'response', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'urinary']",NIEHS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2020,580988,0.04136684885015749
"Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) PROJECT SUMMARY Evidence suggests that exposure to Superfund chemicals contributes to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), including preterm birth (PTB). Rates of PTB and infant mortality in Puerto Rico (PR) are among the highest of all US states and territories. There are 18 Superfund sites in PR, and evidence of contamination of the drinking water is extensive. Moreover, extreme weather events (hurricanes, flooding) may result in elevated exposures to Superfund chemicals. The PROTECT center has brought together researchers from Northeastern University, the University of Puerto Rico, University of Georgia, and the University of Michigan to provide much needed understanding of the relationship and the mechanisms by which exposure to suspect chemicals contribute to APOs, and to develop new methods to reduce risk of exposure in PR and beyond. To do this, PROTECT uses a source-to-outcome structure, integrating epidemiological (Project 1), toxicological (Project 2), fate and transport (Project 3), and remediation (Project 4) studies, a unified sampling infrastructure, a centralized indexed data repository, and a sophisticated data management system. Since its inception in 2010, PROTECT has built detailed and extensive data sets on environmental conditions and prenatal conditions of 1457 pregnant mothers (exposure, socioeconomic and health data–close to 3000 data points per participant), yielding a cohort of 1210 live births in northern PR. In the renewal, PROTECT will recruit and follow an additional 1000 study participants, yielding a cohort of 800+ live births for an ultimate total cohort of 2000+ completed live births. PROTECT has documented significant contamination of northern PR drinking water and has found compelling preliminary epidemiologic and mechanistic toxicology associations between Superfund chemicals and APOs. PROTECT research has focused on chlorinated volatile organic compounds and phthalates and their role in PTB. The PROTECT renewal will broaden its scope, employing a data-driven approach to study and reduce the impact of exposure to mixtures of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites in karst regions on APOs in Puerto Rico’s underserved, highly-exposed population. Target chemicals will be expanded to include metals, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We will investigate the impacts of extreme weather events on contaminant transport and exposure, and new water treatment technologies will be developed for portable and robust water treatment systems. The PROTECT renewal will also focus on oxidative stress as an underlying biological pathway by which contaminant exposure can lead to APOs. New statistical methods and data mining, machine learning, and visualization tools will be developed to allow PROTECT researchers to analyze our datasets. PROTECT will employ innovative approaches to engage and educate the community, involve study participants, report- back data, and communicate with stakeholders. A broad suite of training and professional activities will be provided to trainees, individually tailored to the trainees’ needs and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Reproductive health has been at the forefront of Puerto Ricans’ health concerns as rates of preterm birth and infant mortality in Puerto Rico are among the highest of all U.S. states and territories. The PROTECT SRC is exploring the link between exposure to a mixture of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites and adverse pregnancy outcomes in Puerto Rico, and is working to reduce that exposure. Improved understanding of the link between adverse pregnancy outcomes and contamination, together with developing sustainable technologies to reduce risk, will help improve health outcomes in Puerto Rico (a disadvantaged population) and beyond.",Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT),9839906,P42ES017198,"['Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Floods', 'Geographic state', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Hurricane', 'Individual', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infrastructure', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxidative Stress Pathway', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pesticides', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Public Health Practice', 'Puerto Rican', 'Puerto Rico', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Superfund', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visualization software', 'Water', 'Water Purification', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'community involvement', 'contaminant transport', 'contaminated drinking water', 'contaminated water', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'disadvantaged population', 'drinking water', 'experience', 'extreme weather', 'ground water', 'health data', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'new technology', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'portability', 'prenatal', 'recruit', 'remediation', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'sound', 'superfund chemical', 'superfund site', 'tissue culture', 'toxicant', 'volatile organic compound', 'water treatment']",NIEHS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,P42,2020,2414074,0.0749848379183287
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9980863,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,682143,0.06696692233745705
"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9954064,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Buprenorphine', 'Calcarine Sulcus', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methadone', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'critical period', 'drug of abuse', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal drug exposure', 'fetal opioid exposure', 'illicit opioid', 'imaging modality', 'in utero', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'joint attention', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'motor control', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid use', 'opioid use in pregnancy', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prescription opioid', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'standard of care', 'visual control', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,690910,0.09452357981802266
"Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children Maternal substance use disorders are a substantial public health concern and the neurological consequences of prenatal exposure are a major threat to the long-term health of offspring. Globally, prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is between 2-7 and 20-50 per 1000, respectively. By contrast, in certain high-risk communities in South Africa, prevalence is reported to be as high as 63 and 155 per 1000, respectively. Though prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to affect the central nervous system, to date, little data exists in respect of the impact of PAE in early childhood, before both higher-level brain networks are established and other potentially confounding post- natal environmental influences have come into play. For neurodevelopmental disorders, studies have consistently shown that early intervention, based on detection and targeted interventions, leads to better long-term outcomes. We aim to address this precise gap in knowledge by imaging the brain and 3D face across the FASD continuum to investigate early biomarkers, trajectories and functional correlates of PAE in a cohort followed prospectively from birth to age 6 years. Data: Our cohort includes a well characterized subsample of children (PAE and healthy controls) enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Health Study in Cape Town, South Africa, who have been scanned as neonates and at 2-3 years of age. Preliminary published data shows highly significant relationships between PAE and regional gray and white matter changes, already discernible in newborns, well before the age FASD is typically diagnosed. An additional longitudinal assessment at 6-years will yield a unique FASD sample with 3 distinct time points (infants, toddlers and children), allowing characterization of brain and face morphology and brain structure and function in this previously understudied early developmental period. This proposal addresses fundamental gaps concerning the presence, timing and regional specificity of altered brain morphology and structural and functional connectivity in association with the effects of PAE on the developing brain from birth to 6 years, and the relationships with facial dysmorphology. The research team has successfully gathered data from the proposed cohort as neonates and at 2–3 years of age. The benefits of extending this research to a subsequent imaging time-point, with a larger range of developmental and neurobehavioral assessments, provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine longitudinal effects of PAE on the trajectory of the developing brain in these critical early years, the links between neural and face predictors of PAE and the long-term clinical significance of these findings. This research will illuminate early neurodevelopmental mechanisms leading to subsequent behavioral and neurological disturbances, which may allow opportunities for targeting interventions when brain plasticity is still relatively fluid. This project might also lead to new strategies for early diagnosis using both face and brain biomarkers. Project Narrative Fetal exposure of the brain to alcohol can trigger brain abnormalities that unfold over a lifetime with severe consequences both for the affected individual and for society at large. To date, these brain abnormalities and associated deficits and behaviors have mostly been studied in late childhood or later, with very few studies following the consequences of well documented fetal alcohol exposure as they develop in the same individual across time in early childhood when the brain is most responsive to potential treatments. This project will extend an ongoing study of children with fetal alcohol exposure, already characterized as newborns and at age 2-3 to add assessments of the brain and behavior at age 6 and will explore alcohol-induced facial abnormalities as a complementary predictor of brain problems. !",Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children,9969289,R01AA026834,"['2 year old', '3 year old', '3-Dimensional', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neonatal', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'alcohol exposure', 'antenatal', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data fusion', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'efficacy testing', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal alcohol use', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal depression', 'multimodality', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal exposure', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'shape analysis', 'statistics', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,530736,0.07453205105355876
"Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria Project Summary: FASD is a serious public health crisis with 80,000 to 120,000 U.S. pregnancies per year at high risk. FASD diagnostic clinics are very sparse, difficult to sustain because of diagnostic complexity, unable to meet demand, and plagued by disagreement about diagnostic criteria. A recent comparison of five FASD diagnostic systems acknowledged that the lack of objective biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) contributes to disagreement in the field. The goal of the proposed work is to develop and refine neuroimaging methods capable of identifying subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE. A critical component of this project will be to apply these refined neuroimaging “biomarkers” to examine the validity and performance of the most commonly-used FASD diagnostic criteria (alcohol exposure, dysmorphology, growth, and cognition). The proposed project will push the development of imaging methods and will also include an examination of the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic factors. The aims are: 1) perform a comprehensive characterization of the FASD “connectome” using state-of- the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) methods in children with PAE, 2) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FASD diagnostic criteria to provide objective evaluation of FASD criteria (which remain in flux), 3) characterize relationships between connectomics and cognitive functioning, & 4) examine the developmental course of functional connectivity, white matter connectivity, cortical gyrification, and intra-cortical myelin. Participants will undergo longitudinal re-assessment at 15-months to match the new HCP-development paradigm (HCP-D) to allow for comparison to a large normative dataset being collected in Minnesota as part of the HCP-D project. We will capitalize on the developments spawned from the $40 million HCP and will benefit from evaluating the brains of children with PAE against the backdrop of a very large HCP normative dataset (n=1300). The proposed study will examine 45 participants with PAE and 45 matched controls, ages 8-16, all of whom will be evaluated by the CIFASD dysmorphology project. Participants will undergo MRI scans at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at baseline and again 15 months later. The imaging protocol, which contains very high resolution structural, diffusion- weighted, and fMRI scans will evaluate cortical gyrification, intra-cortical myelin, white matter connectivity, and functional connectivity. Data from the HCP-D project will be used as secondary “normative” comparison dataset. We expect to find a number of subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE that have not previously been observed and we will characterize individuals with these metrics. Individual identification of neurodevelopmental anomalies will then allow us to probe the screening properties of commonly used FASD diagnostic criteria and to test the performance of Dr. Mattson's Decision Tree model for rapidly identifying children with developmental effects of PAE. The study will have direct implications for FASD clinical practice and public policies as it will provide objective data about the relative advantages and disadvantages of individual diagnostic elements and it will allow for comparisons of competing FASD diagnostic systems. The proposed project aims to use the most advanced MRI brain imaging techniques available to address a highly practical problem faced by clinicians and public health officials: the lack of consensus about diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the challenges of identifying individuals who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but do not have the physical characteristics upon which a diagnosis can be made. The proposed study will identify subtle brain anomalies in children with PAE with a level of sensitivity not previously attainable. The study will push forward our understanding of how PAE negatively affects the efficiency of the brain's networks. In addition, the study will use these brain imaging results to further refine the diagnostic criteria such that more children will be able to be properly identified as having a neurodevelopmental disorder as a result of PAE.",Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria,9940992,U01AA026102,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dysmorphology', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Myelin', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'connectome', 'diffusion weighted', 'executive function', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'performance tests', 'prisma', 'processing speed', 'screening', 'white matter']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2020,344735,0.052833376085566014
"Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies Project Summary Traditionally, environmental epidemiologic studies have focused on assessing risks related to a single pollutant at a time. This, however, does not reflect reality, since we are constantly exposed to multiple pollutants at once. It is very important, therefore, to be able to assess exposure to pollutant mixtures when conducting environmental epidemiologic methods. Doing so, however, is especially challenging, mainly due to the high dimension of the multi-pollutant exposure matrix (if the exposure of interest includes more than e.g. 5 or 10 chemicals) and because these pollutants are usually very highly correlated with each other. Although some methods are available to address these issues, they usually require strong assumptions and have severe limitations. With this study we propose to bypass most of these limitations by adapting and extending a novel and robust method to assess exposure to multiple pollutants, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). We will assess the performance of PCP synthetic datasets representing multiple potential scenarios and study designs, and compare our results to those obtained by existing methods. Subsequently, we will apply PCP to three important Public Health issues, i.e. to evaluate the associations between (i) in utero exposure to a mixture of PCBs and neurodevelopment, (ii) exposure to a metals mixture and cardiovascular health, and (iii) exposure to an air pollution mixture and emergency cardiovascular admissions. Finally, we will develop and share software so other researchers can freely use this novel, robust and flexible tool across a plethora of study designs and research questions. Our proposed work will be significant as it will provide epidemiologists with a novel and robust tool to assess exposure to environmental pollutant mixtures. Project Narrative We are constantly exposed to a mixture of environmental pollutants at once, but current epidemiologic methods either assess each pollutant separately, not capturing reality, or have severe limitations. With this study we propose to adapt a wildly popular method used in computer vision applications, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), and develop flexible extensions for many epidemiologic settings. We propose to assess the performance of this method, compare with existing methods and employ in real-life applications, as well as develop and share software so other research can also use this novel, robust and flexible tool.",Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies,9843133,R01ES028805,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Educational workshop', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Poison', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Work', 'cardiovascular emergency', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'policy implication', 'pollutant', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,569866,0.10608900633840808
"Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment. Abstract Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities, with prevalence estimates of 3-10/1000 individuals in the US and up to 80/1000 in endemic communities. The promise of an increasing number of interventions tailored to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-related neurobehavioral deficits is limited by diagnostic difficulties in clinical practice. Currently known biomarkers of exposure are neither sensitive nor specific for neurobehavioral deficits, in part because not all exposed children are affected. There is, therefore, a critical need for biomarkers of effect to identify affected children who would benefit from early, tailored therapeutic interventions. A growing body of literature has demonstrated alcohol-induced alterations in epigenetic programming as an important potential mechanism in FASD, suggesting that such alterations may serve as biomarkers of effect. Imprinted genes comprise a unique subset of epigenetically regulated genes that is sensitive to prenatal insults. There is considerable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected by FASD and those seen in experimental animal models of imprinted gene dysregulation, including learning, memory, and attachment. In a prenatally- recruited, prospective longitudinal cohort, we recently found that PAE was associated with alterations in placental level of expression of 11 of 93 expressed imprinted genes. Expression changes for five of these genes statistically mediated effects of alcohol on postnatal growth, identifying these alterations as biomarkers of fetal alcohol growth restriction. Given the remarkable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected in FASD and those affected by alteration of imprinted gene expression in animal models, alcohol-induced alterations in placental imprinted gene expression may also provide biomarkers for FASD neurocognitive deficits. Although most epigenetic marks are specific to tissue-type and timing of exposure, genomic imprinting maps and our pilot data indicate that markers of imprinted gene dysregulation identified in placental tissue may be detected in blood samples obtained at older ages. The aims of this study are: (1) To characterize the fetal alcohol-related imprintome signature in the placenta and in blood samples obtained at 6 yr; (2) To identify alterations in imprinted gene level of expression and ICR methylation that can serve as biomarkers of effect; (3) To validate findings in Aims 1 and 2 in blood samples from a 2nd, independent cohort. The data for this study will come from two prospective longitudinal cohorts recruited from the Cape Coloured community in Cape Town, South Africa, where the prevalence of FASD is among the highest in the world. Results from this study will make it possible to identify affected children who would benefit from early therapeutic interventions but would likely not be detected by current diagnostic tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite widespread public health advisories, alcohol use during pregnancy persists in the U.S. and worldwide, making fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental delay. The promise of an ever-increasing number of interventions tailored to FASD deficits is limited by difficulties in identifying fetal alcohol-related facial dysmorphology in infancy and early childhood, when interventions are most effective, and in children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, in which neurodevelopmental impairment occurs in the absence of dysmorphic features. This proposal seeks to identify alterations in imprinted gene expression that can be used as biomarkers of adverse effect to identify infants and children with FASD who would benefit from therapeutic interventions but would probably not be detected by current diagnostic tools.",Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment.,10023145,R01AA027916,"['Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Growth Disorders', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methylation', 'Microcephaly', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Nursery Schools', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'South Africa', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'early childhood', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gene function', 'imprint', 'infancy', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,632755,0.03438429996695895
"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual projects.",Administrative Core of the CIFASD,9940986,U24AA014811,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data management', 'diagnostic screening', 'drinking', 'eHealth', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'forging', 'health care service', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical research', 'program dissemination', 'recruit', 'repository', 'resilience', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2020,428830,0.06260581542371363
"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,9928464,R01ES030302,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Arsenic', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cadmium', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manganese', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Temperament', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'behavioral disinhibition', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early pregnancy', 'epigenetic marker', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'loss of function', 'metal poisoning', 'nanosized', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal risk factor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell proliferation', 'tool', 'toxic metal', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,653362,0.12736317260595062
