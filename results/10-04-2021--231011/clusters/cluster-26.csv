"Development of New Genome Editing Agents Using RNA Modifying Enzymes Komor – Project Summary/Abstract - “Development of New Genome Editing Agents Using RNA Modifying Enzymes”  While targeted genome editing, the introduction of a specific modification in genomic DNA, has the potential to allow researchers to study and better understand mechanisms of human genetic diseases, traditional genome editing methods (including CRISPR-Cas9) that rely on the initial introduction of double stranded DNA breaks (DSB) suffer from modest genome editing efficiencies as well as unwanted gene alterations (indels), particularly when attempting to correct point mutations. Recently, a class of genome editing agents called single base editors was developed that does not involve DSBs, but rather uses a dCas9-tethered single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) modifying enzyme to directly chemically modify target nucleobases within a ~5 nucleotide window determined by the protospacer. Two classes of editors have been developed that use cytosine and adenine deamination chemistries to catalyze the conversion of C•G base pairs to T•A (CBEs), and A•T base pairs to G•C (ABEs), respectively. Here we propose the development and characterization of new base editors capable of facilitating new point mutations using methylation chemistry. We have use a bioinformatic approach to identify RNA modifying enzymes that have the potential to be repurposed into new base editors, and have rationally designed mutant libraries to use with directed evolution to convert these enzymes into base editors (Aim 1). Concurrently, we are developing a machine learning program that utilizes existing ssDNA modifying enzymes to identify putative mutations that will expand the substrate scope of the identified methyltransferases to ssDNA (Aim 2). Mutations identified from both strategies will then be tested and characterized for base editing in multiple orthogonal systems (Aim 3). The successful completion of the proposed work will represent a significant addition to existing base editing technologies, and will enable researchers to cleanly and efficiently install two additional types of point mutations into the genome of living cells, allowing researchers to quickly and effectively general model systems for the study of human genetic diseases. Komor – Project Narrative - “Development of New Genome Editing Agents Using RNA Modifying Enzymes” Base editing enables high efficiency genomic point mutation introduction in a variety of cell types and has the potential to allow researchers to better study human genetic diseases. We propose transformative improvements to current base editing technologies that will expand the types of point mutations that can be introduced by base editors. The tools developed here will enable researchers to cleanly and efficiently install additional types of point mutations into the genome of living cells for the study and potential treatment of human genetic diseases.",Development of New Genome Editing Agents Using RNA Modifying Enzymes,9876634,R21GM135736,"['Adenine', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Case Study', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'Deamination', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inosine', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Methyltransferase', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathogenicity', 'Point Mutation', 'Program Development', 'Proteins', 'Purines', 'Pyrimidine', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transfer RNA', 'Uracil', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adenosine deaminase', 'base', 'cell type', 'combat', 'design', 'genome editing', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular dynamics', 'mutant', 'novel', 'nucleobase', 'preference', 'programs', 'tool', 'transition mutation', 'transversion mutation']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2019,205479,0.10219455042426513
"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses. This project will involve close collaboration with structural biologists and clinician-scientists who are active collaborators of the PI. Project Narrative Genetic mutations, many of which lead to protein mutations, are often associated with human diseases: they often directly cause diseases or contribute to their progressions. Understanding mechanisms by which these mutations lead to significant functional consequences is of extreme importance to developing effective therapeutics to cure diseases and ameliorate drug resistance.",Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations,9774239,R35GM124952,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biophysics', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Drug resistance', 'Goals', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R35,2019,335245,0.1288804574376976
"The adaptive potential of translational regulation Project Summary/Abstract  Our current understanding of the adaptive effects of mutation is largely limited to alterations in protein coding sequence and disruption of transcriptional cis-regulatory promoters. Very little is known about how mutations alter translation, or the role these mutations play in adaptation and evolution. This project seeks to address this gap by identifying the functional effect of mutations on translation. To accomplish this I will first identify mutations that arise from adaptation to various nutrient limited environments. I will then use expression profiling (e.g. RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and RATE-seq) to identify the effect these mutations have on translation, as well as other levels of gene expression. This will provide insight into the magnitude of effect mutations have on translation and their relative rate. Furthermore, to fully characterize the role synonymous mutations have on fitness I will be using a deep scanning synonymous mutation library. To understand the role tRNA abundance plays in the fitness effect of a given synonymous mutations, I will also be evaluating fitness within tRNA under- and over-expression backgrounds. Because of the closely coupled nature of translation rates and mRNA decay, I will also characterize the effect synonymous mutations have on mRNA decay using RATE-seq. My analysis of the functional effects of these mutations on gene expression, particularly within the genetic background and environment in which they arose, will allow for the development of a machine learning algorithm that can use sequence and annotation features to predict the effect of a mutation on gene expression. This tool will aid future research into the effect mutations have of gene expression by allowing the identification of high-confidence candidates for further evaluation.  This project will be conducted at New York University’s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, whose mission is to answer otherwise intractable biological questions using applied experimental and computational approaches. The Center houses numerous facilities and cores that will be instrumental in the performance of this work. The collaborative atmosphere and multi-disciplinary nature of NYU’s research communities that will enable me to stay abreast of developments in related fields and to rapidly communicate my research to interested parties. I will be trained under the guidance of Dr. David Gresham, an excellent researcher working on complementing long-term evolution experiments with gene expression studies to characterize the adaptive potential of the regulation of gene expression. Project Narrative The translation of mRNA into protein is a critical step in gene expression that is tightly regulated with mis-regulation of translation being a hallmark of many human pathologies. Understanding how mutations can alter the regulation of translation is an understudied but important aspect of adaptation and evolution. Ultimately, without an understanding of the adaptive potential of translation we have an incomplete, and imperfect, picture of the underlying genetic causes of numerous forms of cancer and genetic diseases.",The adaptive potential of translational regulation,9683394,F32GM131573,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Pathology', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Nutrient', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Pathology', 'Performance at work', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transfer RNA', 'Translation Initiation', 'Translational Regulation', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'actionable mutation', 'analytical tool', 'cancer genetics', 'collaborative environment', 'environmental change', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'insight', 'interest', 'mRNA Decay', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'preservation', 'promoter', 'response', 'ribosome profiling', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,61226,0.180002142616604
"Computational evaluation of the causal role of somatic mutations in human aging Project Abstract Although genome instability has long been considered as one of the major causal factors of aging, little is known about the actual number of genome alterations per cell and their effects on aging organisms, most notably humans. In the research proposed here I will take a single cell approach to identify the most common types of somatic mutations, i.e., base substitutions, small INDELS, copy number variation, genome structural variation and retrotranspositions, in human B lymphocytes as a function of age. The overarching goal is then to estimate functional effects of these DNA mutations accumulated during human aging in this particular cell type, which will also serve as a model for studying somatic mutations and their consequences in other cell types. This could never be tested before, because it was never possible to analyze random somatic mutations in a tissue by sequencing bulk DNA from that tissue (mutations are low- abundant), I will achieve this goal by utilizing a new, single-cell, whole genome sequencing (SCWGS) protocol that we developed. In this project I will focus on human B lymphocytes from individuals varying in age from about 30 to over 100 years and determine the genome-wide frequency and location of the different types of mutations in multiple cells from each individual (Aim 1). Preliminary results already show a significant increase of both base substitution mutations and CNVs with age, with a substantial number of these mutations in B cell genomic regions that are potentially functional. Hence, in Aim 2 I will predict the actual functional effects of these potentially functional, age-related mutations using machine learning approaches and integrative network analysis. Finally, in Aim 3 I will empirically test these predictions as to whether the mutation loads observed affect B cell's ability of response to stimulus. Hence, to test the long-standing hypothesis of genome instability as a causal factor in aging ,I will determine age-related mutations in single cells at four levels: (1) number of mutations, mutation spectra and genome distribution in individual cells; (2) potential functional effects of individual mutations, i.e., non-synonymous mutations in exons and mutations in gene regulatory regions; (3) mutations collectively affecting the gene regulatory network; and (4) relationship between mutation load and B cell activation status. In summary, the results of the proposed project will, for the first time uncover possible direct functional effects of somatic mutations on cellular function. Project Narrative Genome instability is considered as one of the major factors of aging and age-related diseases. This research aims to study somatic DNA mutations in normal blood cells (B lymphocytes) of humans of different ages and evaluate the functional effect of these mutations. It will dramatically improve the knowledge of DNA mutations in aging and deepen the understanding of genome instability as a basic aging mechanism in human.",Computational evaluation of the causal role of somatic mutations in human aging,9785353,K99AG056656,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'B-Cell Activation', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Cells', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Centenarian', 'Code', 'Collecting Cell', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Replication Damage', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'DNA amplification', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enhancers', 'Evaluation', 'Exons', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomic Segment', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Locus Control Region', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA amplification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Retrotransposition', 'Role', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Cell', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'age related', 'base', 'cell type', 'crosslink', 'dietary restriction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'promoter', 'repair enzyme', 'repaired', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'single cell technology', 'theories', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIA,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K99,2019,135945,0.23455853461449103
"Deep learning-based approach to identify non-coding cancer drivers that alter chromatin conformation Summary Most variants obtained from tumor whole-genome sequences (WGS) occur in non- coding regions of the genome. Although variants in protein-coding regions have received the majority of attention, numerous studies have now noted the importance of non- coding variants in cancer. Identification of functional non-coding variants that drive tumor growth remains a challenge and a bottleneck for the use of whole-genome sequencing in the clinic. Cancer drivers are generally identified by the high frequency at which their mutations occur across patients. However, mutation rate is highly heterogeneous in non- coding regions and many non-driver elements show higher mutation frequency than others, such as regions bound by transcription factors in melanoma or regions replicating late during cell division in colon cancer. In this proposal, we will use high- throughput pooled CRISPR screen and novel computational methods to predict non- coding cancer drivers. We will quantitatively measure the impact of thousands of non- coding mutations using our innovative high-throughput CRISPR screen that directly ties modifications in the native context of the non-coding genome (i.e. not a reporter assay) to a cancer relevant phenotype (cell growth). The results of the screen will be used as training data for the development of NC_Driver, a computational cancer driver prediction tool. NC_Driver will integrate the signals of high functional impact with the recurrence of variants across multiple tumor samples to identify the non-coding mutations under positive selection in cancer. We will identify drivers in promoters, enhancers and CTCF insulators. CTCF insulators are the most mutated yet least studied regulatory elements in the cancer genome. Using this integrative experimental and computational approach, we will identify high-confidence candidate drivers. Finally, we will perform functional evaluation of prioritized non-coding drivers in colorectal and prostate cancers. We will use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in patient-derived cell cultures to test 20 high-ranking candidate driver promoter/enhancer/insulator mutations. Overall, this proposal addresses the critical need to identify drivers in the non-coding genome and over long- term enable the maximal benefit of genome sequencing for each patient. Project Narrative Cancer genomes contain thousands of mutations but only a few of them play an important role in cancer proliferation and are called drivers. Most of the mutations occur in regions of the genome that do not make proteins, yet the majority of previous studies have focused on protein-coding regions. In this proposal, we will use integrative computational and experimental approaches to identify drivers in the non-protein-coding regions of the genome.",Deep learning-based approach to identify non-coding cancer drivers that alter chromatin conformation,9831005,R01CA218668,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Attention', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell division', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinic', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Colon', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Heterogeneity', 'Institutes', 'Knock-in', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prostate', 'Proteins', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Structure', 'Targeted Resequencing', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Xenograft procedure', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer genome', 'cancer type', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'colon cancer cell line', 'deep learning', 'genome editing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'melanoma', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'promoter', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumorigenesis', 'tumorigenic', 'whole genome']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,113967,0.07668869334254236
"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks. Since many human diseases are caused by mutations that affect molecular interactions, this research will expand our understanding of the underlying basis of disease and will provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.",Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes,9740714,R01GM076275,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,312660,0.09471285026053601
"Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein tyrosine kinases are dynamic molecular switches that toggle between a catalytically ""on"" and ""off"" state to turn on and off signals responsible for cell growth and survival. While the tyrosine kinase switch is tightly regulated by  diverse array of structural mechanisms in normal states, in many disease states, the switch is permanently turned on or off due, in part, to mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. Although genome sequencing studies have revealed the mutational patterns of tyrosine kinases from many different disease types, understanding the structural and functional impact of these mutations is a challenge because many recurrent mutations occur far from the active site (distal mutations) and the residue networks that contribute to the complex modes of tyrosine kinase allosteric regulation are not fully understood. Our long term goal is to understand the relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in protein kinases using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Our objective in this proposal, which is the next logical step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to delineate the residue interaction networks that contribute to the unique modes of allosteric regulation in tyrosine kinases, and to develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact using the evolutionary and allosteric properties encoded in three dimensional structures. The central hypothesis is that distal mutations alter evolutionarily conserved allosteric networks in tyrosine kinases, and delineating the allosteric networks unique to tyrosine kinases will provide context for predicting and testing disease mutation impact. The specific aims are: * To identify and characterize natural sequence and structural variants associated with tight  allosteric control of tyrosine kinase activity * To develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact on kinase activation and to  experimentally validate computational predictions using selected receptor tyrosine kinases as  model systems Successful completion of these aims is expected to reveal novel activating mutations in putative allosteric sites in the tyrosine kinase domain, and pinpoint key residues and interactions for functional studies. These outcomes, in turn, are expected to have major biomedical impact by accelerating the functional characterization of the mutated tyrosine kinome, which is emerging as a major target for personalized medicine. Finally, by providing detailed mechanistic annotation of mutations identified in genome sequencing studies, this proposal will address a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in translational medicine of converting genomic discoveries into therapeutic strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein tyrosine kinases are a biomedically important class of proteins that are abnormally regulated in many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders, to name but a few. They have been the focus of many drug discovery efforts and genome sequencing studies because of the therapeutic potential of targeting mutated tyrosine kinases for personalized therapy.

"A statistical framework to systematically characterize cancer driver mutations in noncoding genomic regions PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer genomes typically harbor a substantial number of somatic mutations. Relatively few driver mutations actually alter the function of proteins in tumor cells, whereas most mutations are considered to be functionally neutral passenger mutations. Over the past decade, the search for cancer driver mutations has focused on coding regions and several mutational significance algorithms have been developed for coding mutations. The contribution of mutations in noncoding regulatory regions to tumor formation largely remains unknown and current mutational significance algorithms are not designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions, due to biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations. The emerging availability of large whole- genome sequencing datasets (e.g. PCAWG and HMF datasets) creates an ample opportunity to develop new mutational significance algorithms that are particularly designed for the interpretation of noncoding regions. Recently, we have developed a new statistical approach that identifies driver mutations in coding regions based on the nucleotide context. Critically, consideration of the nucleotide context around mutations does not require prior knowledge for functional consequences associated with these mutations. Hence, we hypothesize that generalizing our nucleotide context model to noncoding regions will uncover novel noncoding driver mutations that cannot be detected using the mutational significance approaches currently available. For this purpose, we will develop a statistical framework that incorporates the biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations and that is specifically designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions. Specifically, we will consider the context-dependent distribution of passenger mutations, modeling of the background mutation rate, accurately partition the background mutation rate, model the sequence composition of the reference genome, and account for coverage fluctuation. We will then combine these statistical components by computing an independent product of their underlying probabilities. We will derive a significance p-value using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach, and use FDR for multiple hypothesis test correction. This strategy will allow us to accurately estimate the significance of somatic mutations in noncoding genomic regions. We will next apply this statistical framework to whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients, thereby deriving a comprehensive list of candidate driver mutations in noncoding regions. Finally, we will investigate whether noncoding mutations are overrepresented in transcription factor binding sites, regulate gene expression levels, induce alternative splicing, or affect epigenomic states. Upon the completion of this project, we will have developed and applied a statistical framework for discovery of significant somatic mutations in noncoding regions, and defined the mutational landscape of the non-coding cancer genome. All aspects of the methods developed and applied in this project will be made open source and developed in an online platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE While coding cancer driver mutations have been characterized in detail over the past decade, the contribution of noncoding mutations to tumor formation remains - apart from few examples (e.g. mutations in TERT promoters) - largely unknown. Recently, large-scale whole-genome sequencing datasets have been made available, but a major bottleneck for the biological and clinical interpretation of these cancer whole-genome cohorts is the lack of statistical models that identify driver mutations in noncoding regions. We developed a new statistical approach that characterizes driver mutations based on their surrounding nucleotide context in coding regions, and herein we propose a concrete plan to generalize our computational model to noncoding regions, apply our model to aggregated whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients (PCAWG, HMF datasets), and define the noncoding driver and passenger mutational landscape for biological discovery and focused clinical application.",A statistical framework to systematically characterize cancer driver mutations in noncoding genomic regions,9825986,R21CA242861,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Attention', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Immunotherapy', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Untranslated RNA', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'checkpoint therapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'exome sequencing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunogenicity', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'open source', 'predicting response', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'reference genome', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2019,232291,0.2614308301508322
"High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation and one of the driving forces of evolution. Both the absolute mutation rate and the relative rate among mutation subtypes fluctuate along the genome, affected by adjacent nucleotide motifs and local features such as GC content and replication timing. Characterizing regional variation of mutation patterns is critical for understanding genome evolution and to identify variants causing genetic diseases. However, mutation rate and molecular spectrum are difficult to measure at high resolution, genomewide, and in an unbiased fashion. Estimates based on common variants and between- species substitutions are confounded by natural selection, population demographic history, and biased gene conversion (BGC). Methods relying on incidence rates of monogenic diseases or finding de novo variants by trio sequencing can inform global trends, but do not provide sufficient data to assess fine-scale local parameters. This study will overcome these limitations by using the extremely rare variants (ERVs) as a new data source to characterize patterns of recent germline variation in humans. ERVs, defined in this study as singletons in 30,000 samples, are becoming available via large-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of population samples. Unlike common variants or substitutions, ERVs arose very recently and are largely unaffected by selection, BGC, etc. We will analyze 200-300 million singleton variants observed in 30,000 subjects at 20-30X coverage. The regional distribution of ERV subtypes will establish a quantitative atlas of the rate and spectrum of human germline mutations mostly unaltered by selection. We will share this resource with the research community and apply it to determine the impact of local genomic features and epigenomic attributes. We will use the systematic departures between ERVs and variants of higher frequencies (polymorphisms and substitutions) to infer local effects of selection, and this may uncover hitherto unknown functional regions of the genome. By comparing mutation signatures in ERVs with those in somatic variations observed in diverse cancers we will attribute distinct mutational signatures to known biochemical processes and thus infer the major contributors to new germline mutations in the human genome. This subtype-specific atlas will also be used to predict the probability of observing every possible single-base mutation in the genome, thus facilitating the interpretation of candidate causal variants of human diseases. We will assess mutation pattern differences among European Americans, African Americans and Latinos, and seek to discover genetic modifiers of germline mutation rate by finding functionally damaging mutations that show increased ERV counts in the surrounding genomic region, potentially identifying both known and previous unknown ""mutator"" genes that play a role in transmission fidelity in humans. This research will provide an essential resource to study the genesis and maintenance of germline mutations in humans. Understanding such a fundamental process will be the basis for a deeper understanding of human evolution and diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will study the patterns of inherited mutations in humans using approximately 250 million extremely rare DNA variants in human populations. Our results will allow the prediction of the rate of new mutations at every site in the genome based on features of the surrounding DNA sequence, thus providing a common resource to study the arrival and maintenance of mutations in humans. Understanding such a basic process is important for answering fundamental questions in human evolution, the cause of inherited diseases, and the role of DNA abnormality in cancer and aging.",High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms,9702844,R01GM118928,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Atlases', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'European', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Latino', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'causal variant', 'data sharing', 'density', 'driving force', 'epigenomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'next generation sequencing', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'repository', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'web server', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,300191,0.19302463390512406
"A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions Project summary There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mutations are preferentially targeted to the variable (V) regions of the Immunoglobulin (Ig) loci during somatic hypermutation (SHM). The persistence of this gap has limited our understanding of the mutagenic mechanisms involving activation-induced deaminase (AID) in the immune response and in the role of AID in mis-targeting mutations leading to B-cell lymphomas and other cancers. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the global targeting of mutations in immunity that are required to protect us from infections. As high-throughput data from human antibody immune responses became available, it provided us with new opportunities to generate hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of SHM. We now propose to generate further hypotheses using computational models applied to additional databases and to validate these hypotheses using cellular and animal experiments. Our objective is to understand what directs SHM across the many human Ig heavy chain V-regions. Our central hypothesis is that the V-region SHM process is highly dependent on a DNA sequence signature(s) that drives mutations in a largely deterministic fashion. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary results using human in vivo data from a few human V region genes and has begun to be validated using independent databases and experiments in human B cell lines. The rationale is that evaluations of computational data based upon biological mechanisms, together with appropriate biological experiments, will reveal the key differences between IGHV regions (IGHV 3-23, 4-34, 1-18, 1-02, etc.) that lead to the dominance of each of those V regions in the responses to medically important antigens. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) identify the extent to which a DNA signature determines the mutation process in four individual human IGHV genes that are important in disease responses; 2) examine the relationship between AID hotspots and Polη hotspots across all the other human V region genes, thus rigorously defining a mutation targeting signature. Both aims will also entail studying human V region genes and modifications of them in human cell lines and in mice expressing a human V region to further confirm the signature and identify molecular mechanisms in vivo. Our approach is innovative because the computational models we are proposing will be mechanistically motivated focusing on the interaction between AID and Polη hotspots, thus testing molecular mechanisms as opposed to classic statistical models using whole V region sequences that ignore the underlying biology. In addition, to focus on mechanisms we will leverage new high-throughput data from human V regions that have not undergone antigen selection. Our results will be highly relevant to human IgV repertoire analyses from immune responses that are currently hard to interpret and will help future vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, as well as help to understand mutations in human malignancies where AID plays a key role. Project narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the targeting of AID-mediated mutations across many human heavy chain V-regions will make it possible to develop vaccines that will lead more rapidly to better and more broadly protective antibodies to infectious agents and reveal the risk factors in the development of B-cell malignancies and gastric and other solid tumors where AID is implicated.",A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions,9653955,R01AI132507,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Experiments', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B lymphoid malignancy', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene-Modified', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Heavy-Chain Immunoglobulins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Knock-in', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stomach', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'activation-induced cytidine deaminase', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'density', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'neutralizing antibody', 'recruit', 'repair enzyme', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'vaccine response']",NIAID,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,587448,0.1515667632202808
"Massively parallel functional analyses of human PTEN variants Project Summary  We are now able to routinely sequence human genomes at single-base resolution. However, our ability to interpret the functional consequences of detected mutations has lagged behind. Computational approaches scale well but have poor accuracy, whereas retrospective analysis of detected variants has high accuracy but does not scale well. In order to solve this problem, a new experimental paradigm has emerged to empirically characterize the effects of mutations with high accuracy at scale. This approach takes advantage of recent and ongoing improvements in DNA synthesis and sequencing, and has the potential to offer unprecedented insight into protein biochemistry and human disease. We believe these insights will prove to be critical for unlocking the potential of genomic medicine.  In this project we seek to comprehensively assess multiple molecular effects of PTEN mutations on protein function, and assess the utility of this data as a predictor for human clinical phenotype. The PTEN protein is a tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in diverse human cancers and in the germline of some individuals with overgrowth disorders, cancer predisposition syndromes, or autism. Currently, it is impossible to predict the effects of the vast majority of PTEN germline mutations. Since the phenotypic spectrum of PTEN mutation carriers is broad, it would be highly valuable to understand the ways in which phenotypic outcomes arise from PTEN mutation genotypes.  In Aim 1, we will first employ a yeast-based screen to assess the effects all PTEN single amino acid mutations on lipid phosphatase activity, the primary biochemical function of PTEN protein. It is known that several pathogenic variants are destabilized. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will perform a second, independent screen to assess the steady state protein stability of all PTEN single amino acid mutations. In Aim 3, we will use the data derived from this study as well as publically available biochemical information to train a classifier model to predict the relationship between the mutation genotypes and clinical phenotypes observed in humans. These data will increase our fundamental understanding of PTEN function and the role of mutations in diverse disorders, and could provide a valuable clinical tool that would increase the quality of life for PTEN mutation carriers. Project Narrative  Mutations in the gene PTEN are causal for a diverse set of clinical disorders ranging from cancer to autism spectrum disorder. Here, we seek to gain new fundamental insights into the functional relationships between PTEN mutations and clinical presentations by prospectively characterizing the effects of all single amino acid PTEN mutations in parallel. These data will allow the creation of new models that can predict risk of specific PTEN mutations for different clinical outcomes and potentially lead to personalized therapies, early interventions, and optimal outcomes for PTEN mutation carriers.",Massively parallel functional analyses of human PTEN variants,9794010,F31HD095571,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'PTEN protein', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylinositols', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Protein Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitination', 'Variant', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'accurate diagnosis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genomic signature', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput technology', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'mutation carrier', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein function', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'tumorigenic']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,45016,0.24657805230605098
"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium.

"Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations ABSTRACT During normal development, aging, and diseases such as cancer, DNA damage due to endogenous and external factors, and repair defects result in accumulation of different types of somatic mutations including single nucleotide substitutions, small InDels, copy number alterations, translocations, and ploidy changes. While a vast majority of somatic mutations in the genome are not disease drivers, their patterns of genetic changes and associated context can provide insights into past exposure to mutagens, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair defects, and extent of genomic instability, which are important for understanding disease etiology, minimizing hazardous environmental exposure, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies such as immunotherapy. A number of mutation signatures have been identified based on local sequence contexts to address this need. But, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair preferences depend on both local sequence and epigenomic contexts, and it remains to be understood whether epigenomic contexts of emerging mutation signatures can provide critical, complementary etiological insights at a genome-wide scale, which are not apparent from sequence contexts alone. This is of fundamental importance, because (i) etiology of many of the emerging mutation signatures is currently unknown, (ii) DNA damage response and repair depends on tissue contexts, and defects in core DNA repair genes often result in cancer development in tissue-specific manner, and (iii) differences in the extent of DNA damage and repair between stem and differentiated cells within the same tissues have consequences for aging and disease incidence rates. Built logically on our previous works, we propose to develop computational approaches to determine the impact of epigenomic contexts on the patterns of somatic mutations within and across tissue types, and validate computational predictions using targeted experiments. In Aim-1, we will develop an epigenomic context preference map for emerging mutation signatures. In Aim-2, we will determine the basis of tissue-dependent differences in mutation profiles attributed to DNA repair defects. In Aim-3, we will predict the extent of cell lineage-dependent patterns of mutation accumulation from the mutational landscape of terminal cells. I am currently an early stage investigator, and the proposal is aligned with my long-term goal to identify fundamental principles of mutability and evolvability of somatic genomes. Our project will deliver novel resources and knowledge for addressing questions regarding genomic integrity during development and aging, and diseases such as cancer. ! PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will use computational biology approaches to determine epigenomic context preference for somatic mutations, and use that to infer tissue-dependent changes in mutation patterns. Our results will provide fundamental insights into aspects of genome maintenance, which is important for advancing our understanding of cancer etiology, reducing exposure to mutagenic factors, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies. !",Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations,9737246,R01GM129066,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Relapse', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagens', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Ploidies', 'Point Mutation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Stem cells', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'computer framework', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome integrity', 'genome-wide', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'repaired', 'response', 'stem', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,RBHS -CANCER INSTITUTE OF NEW JERSEY,R01,2019,336177,0.1708585813745905
"Understanding modifiers of mendelian mutation penetrance using familial hypercholesterolemia as a model PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rare monogenic forms of common diseases have provided key fundamental insights about common disease. However, genetic, environmental, and stochastic elements influence risk for disease. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an autosomal dominant disorder afflicting 1 in 250 linked to severe increases in LDL cholesterol and premature coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, is an ideal model to characterize modifiers of disease. Despite the presence of a strong genetic driver of hypercholesterolemia from FH mutations, we recently observed that half do not have the expected severe hypercholesterolemia. In this proposal, we outline several methods to discover and dissect the genetic and non-genetic factors influencing CHD risk conferred by FH mutations in humans and determine whether knowledge of these factors can improve risk discrimination among those with FH mutations. Our approach harnesses several multi-dimensional datasets: whole genome sequences, metabolomics, and cross-sectional and longitudinal cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 1, we will aggregate and curate 75,000 deep (30X) whole genome sequences and cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will discover genetic and non-genetic modifiers of LDL cholesterol and CHD risk in FH and evaluate their metabolomic consequences. In Aim 3, we will develop a method incorporating genetics and longitudinal non- genetic exposures for CHD risk stratification among ~4,000 with FH mutations in the Million Veteran Program. In addition to the proposed Aims, this five-year proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy for the principal investigator's (PI's) scientific and professional development in academic cardiovascular medicine. The research strategy builds upon the PI's prior research experience and clinical training. In addition to an undergraduate degree in Molecular Biology and master's degree in Biomedical Informatics, he completed post- graduate medical training in Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Medicine. He recently developed a new preventive/genetic cardiology clinic focusing on the evaluation and management of those with or a family history of premature CHD, including those with FH, at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills in human genetics and genomics into new domains: integrative genomics, statistical genetics, clinical informatics, and risk modeling. The career development goals will be at achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentorship, collaboration, didactic coursework, conferences, and scientific investigation. This work will take place in a unique training environment comprised of MGH and the Broad Institute. Successful completion of this career development award will result in improved fundamental understanding of the determinants of CHD, result in the PI's transition to an independent physician-scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for R01-level funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Cardiovascular disease, largely due to coronary heart disease (CHD), remains the leading cause of death in the United States and now worldwide despite current advances. Familial hypercholesterolemia is a relative common genetic disorder characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia and premature CHD but many carrying these mutations do not develop these consequences. This proposal seeks to define and characterize the factors modifying CHD risk among those with FH mutations; success has the potential to broadly identify new mechanisms of CHD and novel strategies for prevention.",Understanding modifiers of mendelian mutation penetrance using familial hypercholesterolemia as a model,9609507,K08HL140203,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'Amish', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Biochemical', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family history of', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Mutation', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Massachusetts', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Network-based', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'heart disease risk', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'next generation', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision medicine', 'premature', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'trait', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2019,170003,0.0941449953737819
"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses. This project will involve close collaboration with structural biologists and clinician-scientists who are active collaborators of the PI. Project Narrative Genetic mutations, many of which lead to protein mutations, are often associated with human diseases: they often directly cause diseases or contribute to their progressions. Understanding mechanisms by which these mutations lead to significant functional consequences is of extreme importance to developing effective therapeutics to cure diseases and ameliorate drug resistance.",Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations,9564155,R35GM124952,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biophysics', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Drug resistance', 'Goals', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R35,2018,335245,0.1288804574376976
"Computational evaluation of the causal role of somatic mutations in human aging Project Abstract Although genome instability has long been considered as one of the major causal factors of aging, little is known about the actual number of genome alterations per cell and their effects on aging organisms, most notably humans. In the research proposed here I will take a single cell approach to identify the most common types of somatic mutations, i.e., base substitutions, small INDELS, copy number variation, genome structural variation and retrotranspositions, in human B lymphocytes as a function of age. The overarching goal is then to estimate functional effects of these DNA mutations accumulated during human aging in this particular cell type, which will also serve as a model for studying somatic mutations and their consequences in other cell types. This could never be tested before, because it was never possible to analyze random somatic mutations in a tissue by sequencing bulk DNA from that tissue (mutations are low- abundant), I will achieve this goal by utilizing a new, single-cell, whole genome sequencing (SCWGS) protocol that we developed. In this project I will focus on human B lymphocytes from individuals varying in age from about 30 to over 100 years and determine the genome-wide frequency and location of the different types of mutations in multiple cells from each individual (Aim 1). Preliminary results already show a significant increase of both base substitution mutations and CNVs with age, with a substantial number of these mutations in B cell genomic regions that are potentially functional. Hence, in Aim 2 I will predict the actual functional effects of these potentially functional, age-related mutations using machine learning approaches and integrative network analysis. Finally, in Aim 3 I will empirically test these predictions as to whether the mutation loads observed affect B cell's ability of response to stimulus. Hence, to test the long-standing hypothesis of genome instability as a causal factor in aging ,I will determine age-related mutations in single cells at four levels: (1) number of mutations, mutation spectra and genome distribution in individual cells; (2) potential functional effects of individual mutations, i.e., non-synonymous mutations in exons and mutations in gene regulatory regions; (3) mutations collectively affecting the gene regulatory network; and (4) relationship between mutation load and B cell activation status. In summary, the results of the proposed project will, for the first time uncover possible direct functional effects of somatic mutations on cellular function. Project Narrative Genome instability is considered as one of the major factors of aging and age-related diseases. This research aims to study somatic DNA mutations in normal blood cells (B lymphocytes) of humans of different ages and evaluate the functional effect of these mutations. It will dramatically improve the knowledge of DNA mutations in aging and deepen the understanding of genome instability as a basic aging mechanism in human.",Computational evaluation of the causal role of somatic mutations in human aging,9527264,K99AG056656,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'B-Cell Activation', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Cells', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Centenarian', 'Code', 'Collecting Cell', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Replication Damage', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'DNA amplification', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enhancers', 'Evaluation', 'Exons', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomic Segment', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Locus Control Region', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA amplification', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Retrotransposition', 'Role', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Cell', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'age related', 'base', 'cell type', 'crosslink', 'dietary restriction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'promoter', 'repair enzyme', 'repaired', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'single cell technology', 'theories', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIA,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",K99,2018,40760,0.23455853461449103
"Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer ABSTRACT  Next generation genome scale sequencing of patients is now becoming routine for two classes of disease: rare  Mendelian traits and cancer. In favorable cases, these data allow identification of relevant mutations and thus  aid diagnosis and therapy. In both classes of disease, the most common type of mutation is missense -­ single  base  changes  that  result  in  an  amino  acid  substitution  in  a  protein.  Uncertainty  as  to  the  impact  of  these  mutations on in vivo protein activity has resulted in a very conservative approach to their interpretation in the  clinic,  so  causing  many  missed  opportunities  for  targeted  treatment.  The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  use  a  combination of three strategies to make the interpretation of these mutations much more applicable in the clinic.  There are already a large number of computational methods that attempt to determine the impact of missense  mutations on function, and there is substantial evidence that these have useful accuracy. The primary difficulty  is that the accuracy in any particular case is not reliably calibrated. Therefore, our first aim is to use a combination  of these methods to develop an approach focused on more reliable estimates for the probability of high impact  on  protein  function  (i.e.  more  confident  P  values).  The  second  aim  is  to  maximize  the  utilization  of  three-­ dimensional structural information, largely ignored by most computational methods. A large fraction of missense  mutations in these classes of disease act by destabilizing protein structure and knowledge of structure allows  these to be identified with much higher reliability. Also, structure provides a framework for detailed annotation  and comprehension of function. To facilitate the utilization of structure, we will implement a modeling platform  that leverages available experimental information to maximize the structural data available for analyzing mutation  impact.  An  important  aspect  of  the  platform  is  incorporation  of  methods  for  evaluating  the  reliability  of  the  structural features relevant to analysis of each mutation. In the third aim we will build specific functional models  for each protein of interest, integrating information from current databases, the literature, and community input,  so as to provide the richest possible background against which to judge the impact of mutations. Proteopedia, a  well established media wiki for proteins, will be used to provide an integrated view of text, data, and structure. A  key component of the information resource will be contributions from curators, who will provide annotation and  also solicit input from other experts. This aspect of the project builds on experience with other crowdsourcing  endeavors,  including  CASP,  CAGI  and  Proteopedia.    There  will  be  three  primary  outcomes  from  the  project:  First, improved reliability for the interpretation of missense mutations. Second, a prototype mutation annotation  procedure suitable for use in a clinical setting. Third, the resource will provide information of benefit to a range  of other scientists, thus facilitating the analysis of disease related mutations.      NARRATIVE  Genome  scale  DNA  sequencing  is  now  contributing  to  diagnosis  and  therapy  in  cases  of  rare  human  disease and cancer.  Full exploitation of these data is currently hampered by inadequate understanding  of which DNA changes affect protein function so as to contribute to disease. This project aims to develop  the methods and tools needed to remove that obstacle. ",Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer,9504498,R01GM120364,"['AIDS diagnosis', 'AIDS therapy', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'crowdsourcing', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'next generation', 'primary outcome', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'wiki']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2018,336086,0.19892642731588644

"High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation and one of the driving forces of evolution. Both the absolute mutation rate and the relative rate among mutation subtypes fluctuate along the genome, affected by adjacent nucleotide motifs and local features such as GC content and replication timing. Characterizing regional variation of mutation patterns is critical for understanding genome evolution and to identify variants causing genetic diseases. However, mutation rate and molecular spectrum are difficult to measure at high resolution, genomewide, and in an unbiased fashion. Estimates based on common variants and between- species substitutions are confounded by natural selection, population demographic history, and biased gene conversion (BGC). Methods relying on incidence rates of monogenic diseases or finding de novo variants by trio sequencing can inform global trends, but do not provide sufficient data to assess fine-scale local parameters. This study will overcome these limitations by using the extremely rare variants (ERVs) as a new data source to characterize patterns of recent germline variation in humans. ERVs, defined in this study as singletons in 30,000 samples, are becoming available via large-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of population samples. Unlike common variants or substitutions, ERVs arose very recently and are largely unaffected by selection, BGC, etc. We will analyze 200-300 million singleton variants observed in 30,000 subjects at 20-30X coverage. The regional distribution of ERV subtypes will establish a quantitative atlas of the rate and spectrum of human germline mutations mostly unaltered by selection. We will share this resource with the research community and apply it to determine the impact of local genomic features and epigenomic attributes. We will use the systematic departures between ERVs and variants of higher frequencies (polymorphisms and substitutions) to infer local effects of selection, and this may uncover hitherto unknown functional regions of the genome. By comparing mutation signatures in ERVs with those in somatic variations observed in diverse cancers we will attribute distinct mutational signatures to known biochemical processes and thus infer the major contributors to new germline mutations in the human genome. This subtype-specific atlas will also be used to predict the probability of observing every possible single-base mutation in the genome, thus facilitating the interpretation of candidate causal variants of human diseases. We will assess mutation pattern differences among European Americans, African Americans and Latinos, and seek to discover genetic modifiers of germline mutation rate by finding functionally damaging mutations that show increased ERV counts in the surrounding genomic region, potentially identifying both known and previous unknown ""mutator"" genes that play a role in transmission fidelity in humans. This research will provide an essential resource to study the genesis and maintenance of germline mutations in humans. Understanding such a fundamental process will be the basis for a deeper understanding of human evolution and diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will study the patterns of inherited mutations in humans using approximately 250 million extremely rare DNA variants in human populations. Our results will allow the prediction of the rate of new mutations at every site in the genome based on features of the surrounding DNA sequence, thus providing a common resource to study the arrival and maintenance of mutations in humans. Understanding such a basic process is important for answering fundamental questions in human evolution, the cause of inherited diseases, and the role of DNA abnormality in cancer and aging.",High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms,9494629,R01GM118928,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Atlases', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Child', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'European', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Internet', 'Latino', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Nucleotides', 'Parents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'data sharing', 'density', 'driving force', 'epigenomics', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'next generation sequencing', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'repository', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,300473,0.19302463390512406
"Massively parallel functional analyses of human PTEN variants Project Summary  We are now able to routinely sequence human genomes at single-base resolution. However, our ability to interpret the functional consequences of detected mutations has lagged behind. Computational approaches scale well but have poor accuracy, whereas retrospective analysis of detected variants has high accuracy but does not scale well. In order to solve this problem, a new experimental paradigm has emerged to empirically characterize the effects of mutations with high accuracy at scale. This approach takes advantage of recent and ongoing improvements in DNA synthesis and sequencing, and has the potential to offer unprecedented insight into protein biochemistry and human disease. We believe these insights will prove to be critical for unlocking the potential of genomic medicine.  In this project we seek to comprehensively assess multiple molecular effects of PTEN mutations on protein function, and assess the utility of this data as a predictor for human clinical phenotype. The PTEN protein is a tumor suppressor that is frequently mutated in diverse human cancers and in the germline of some individuals with overgrowth disorders, cancer predisposition syndromes, or autism. Currently, it is impossible to predict the effects of the vast majority of PTEN germline mutations. Since the phenotypic spectrum of PTEN mutation carriers is broad, it would be highly valuable to understand the ways in which phenotypic outcomes arise from PTEN mutation genotypes.  In Aim 1, we will first employ a yeast-based screen to assess the effects all PTEN single amino acid mutations on lipid phosphatase activity, the primary biochemical function of PTEN protein. It is known that several pathogenic variants are destabilized. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will perform a second, independent screen to assess the steady state protein stability of all PTEN single amino acid mutations. In Aim 3, we will use the data derived from this study as well as publically available biochemical information to train a classifier model to predict the relationship between the mutation genotypes and clinical phenotypes observed in humans. These data will increase our fundamental understanding of PTEN function and the role of mutations in diverse disorders, and could provide a valuable clinical tool that would increase the quality of life for PTEN mutation carriers. Project Narrative  Mutations in the gene PTEN are causal for a diverse set of clinical disorders ranging from cancer to autism spectrum disorder. Here, we seek to gain new fundamental insights into the functional relationships between PTEN mutations and clinical presentations by prospectively characterizing the effects of all single amino acid PTEN mutations in parallel. These data will allow the creation of new models that can predict risk of specific PTEN mutations for different clinical outcomes and potentially lead to personalized therapies, early interventions, and optimal outcomes for PTEN mutation carriers.",Massively parallel functional analyses of human PTEN variants,9539482,F31HD095571,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'PTEN protein', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylinositols', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Protein Biochemistry', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitination', 'Variant', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'accurate diagnosis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genomic signature', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput technology', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'mutation carrier', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein function', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'tumorigenic']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,0.24657805230605098
"A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions Project summary There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mutations are preferentially targeted to the variable (V) regions of the Immunoglobulin (Ig) loci during somatic hypermutation (SHM). The persistence of this gap has limited our understanding of the mutagenic mechanisms involving activation-induced deaminase (AID) in the immune response and in the role of AID in mis-targeting mutations leading to B-cell lymphomas and other cancers. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the global targeting of mutations in immunity that are required to protect us from infections. As high-throughput data from human antibody immune responses became available, it provided us with new opportunities to generate hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of SHM. We now propose to generate further hypotheses using computational models applied to additional databases and to validate these hypotheses using cellular and animal experiments. Our objective is to understand what directs SHM across the many human Ig heavy chain V-regions. Our central hypothesis is that the V-region SHM process is highly dependent on a DNA sequence signature(s) that drives mutations in a largely deterministic fashion. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary results using human in vivo data from a few human V region genes and has begun to be validated using independent databases and experiments in human B cell lines. The rationale is that evaluations of computational data based upon biological mechanisms, together with appropriate biological experiments, will reveal the key differences between IGHV regions (IGHV 3-23, 4-34, 1-18, 1-02, etc.) that lead to the dominance of each of those V regions in the responses to medically important antigens. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) identify the extent to which a DNA signature determines the mutation process in four individual human IGHV genes that are important in disease responses; 2) examine the relationship between AID hotspots and Polη hotspots across all the other human V region genes, thus rigorously defining a mutation targeting signature. Both aims will also entail studying human V region genes and modifications of them in human cell lines and in mice expressing a human V region to further confirm the signature and identify molecular mechanisms in vivo. Our approach is innovative because the computational models we are proposing will be mechanistically motivated focusing on the interaction between AID and Polη hotspots, thus testing molecular mechanisms as opposed to classic statistical models using whole V region sequences that ignore the underlying biology. In addition, to focus on mechanisms we will leverage new high-throughput data from human V regions that have not undergone antigen selection. Our results will be highly relevant to human IgV repertoire analyses from immune responses that are currently hard to interpret and will help future vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, as well as help to understand mutations in human malignancies where AID plays a key role. Project narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the targeting of AID-mediated mutations across many human heavy chain V-regions will make it possible to develop vaccines that will lead more rapidly to better and more broadly protective antibodies to infectious agents and reveal the risk factors in the development of B-cell malignancies and gastric and other solid tumors where AID is implicated.",A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions,9518337,R01AI132507,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Experiments', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B lymphoid malignancy', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene-Modified', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Heavy-Chain Immunoglobulins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Knock-in', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stomach', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'activation-induced cytidine deaminase', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'density', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'neutralizing antibody', 'recruit', 'repair enzyme', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'vaccine response']",NIAID,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2018,537909,0.1515667632202808
"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development.

"Understanding modifiers of mendelian mutation penetrance using familial hypercholesterolemia as a model PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rare monogenic forms of common diseases have provided key fundamental insights about common disease. However, genetic, environmental, and stochastic elements influence risk for disease. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an autosomal dominant disorder afflicting 1 in 250 linked to severe increases in LDL cholesterol and premature coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, is an ideal model to characterize modifiers of disease. Despite the presence of a strong genetic driver of hypercholesterolemia from FH mutations, we recently observed that half do not have the expected severe hypercholesterolemia. In this proposal, we outline several methods to discover and dissect the genetic and non-genetic factors influencing CHD risk conferred by FH mutations in humans and determine whether knowledge of these factors can improve risk discrimination among those with FH mutations. Our approach harnesses several multi-dimensional datasets: whole genome sequences, metabolomics, and cross-sectional and longitudinal cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 1, we will aggregate and curate 75,000 deep (30X) whole genome sequences and cardiovascular phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will discover genetic and non-genetic modifiers of LDL cholesterol and CHD risk in FH and evaluate their metabolomic consequences. In Aim 3, we will develop a method incorporating genetics and longitudinal non- genetic exposures for CHD risk stratification among ~4,000 with FH mutations in the Million Veteran Program. In addition to the proposed Aims, this five-year proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy for the principal investigator's (PI's) scientific and professional development in academic cardiovascular medicine. The research strategy builds upon the PI's prior research experience and clinical training. In addition to an undergraduate degree in Molecular Biology and master's degree in Biomedical Informatics, he completed post- graduate medical training in Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Medicine. He recently developed a new preventive/genetic cardiology clinic focusing on the evaluation and management of those with or a family history of premature CHD, including those with FH, at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills in human genetics and genomics into new domains: integrative genomics, statistical genetics, clinical informatics, and risk modeling. The career development goals will be at achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentorship, collaboration, didactic coursework, conferences, and scientific investigation. This work will take place in a unique training environment comprised of MGH and the Broad Institute. Successful completion of this career development award will result in improved fundamental understanding of the determinants of CHD, result in the PI's transition to an independent physician-scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for R01-level funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Cardiovascular disease, largely due to coronary heart disease (CHD), remains the leading cause of death in the United States and now worldwide despite current advances. Familial hypercholesterolemia is a relative common genetic disorder characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia and premature CHD but many carrying these mutations do not develop these consequences. This proposal seeks to define and characterize the factors modifying CHD risk among those with FH mutations; success has the potential to broadly identify new mechanisms of CHD and novel strategies for prevention.",Understanding modifiers of mendelian mutation penetrance using familial hypercholesterolemia as a model,9431712,K08HL140203,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'Algorithms', 'Amish', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Biochemical', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family history of', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Mutation', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Network-based', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'heart disease risk', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'human genomics', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'metabolomics', 'next generation', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'trait', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2018,173296,0.0941449953737819
"Tracing the evolution of the human mutation rate ﻿DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All genetic variation is created by mutations, changes that arise due to DNA damage or copying mistakes during DNA replication. Mutations are frequent enough that, on average, a child's 3-billion base pair genome contains 74 new genetic variants that are not present in the genome of either parent. Such new mutations confer a higher disease risk than older mutations because they have not passed the test of surviving through several generations of parents and offspring. We aim to pinpoint how the human mutation rate has evolved as humans left Africa and adapted to diverse new environments across the globe.  One specific aim will follow up on my preliminary research which showed that Europeans experienced a mutation rate change after diverging from Africans and Asians. The primary evidence for this change is that European genomes have a higher burden than African or Asian genomes of the mutation type TCC→TTC, where the trinucleotide ""TCC"" has experienced a mutation from ""C"" to ""T"" at its central site. We wish to and the genetic basis of this mutation rate change by looking at rare variants in mixed- ancestry Latino and African-American individuals. Specially, we will isolate young genetic variants that probably arose via mutation within the past 10-15 generations, after gene ow from Europe into the Americas had already begun. We will infer the genetic background (European, African, or Native American) upon which each new mutation arose and look for genomic regions where European ances- try correlates strongly with an excess of TCC→TTC mutations. These will be the regions most likely to harbor a causal allele that changed the process of mutation accumulation in Europeans. This work has the potential to yield valuable insights into melanoma, a cancer that predominantly affects individuals of European ancestry and whose somatic mutational signature is dominated by TCC→TTC.  A second specific aim is to look for other signatures of mutation rate change that have occurred within the human species or, more broadly, within the great apes. We will use a natural language processing technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify collections of mutation types whose rates appear to be under common genetic control. A few mutation types besides TCC→TTC show weak signals of rate differentiation between populations, and we will attempt to infer how many separate mutation rate change events are necessary to explain these signals. The admixture mapping technique from Specific Aim I can also be adapted to interrogate the genetic basis of other mutation rate changes that might have occurred in the recent past. These efforts should improve our understanding of the human mutation rate's genetic architecture and how mutation rates differ between populations.

"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses. This project will involve close collaboration with structural biologists and clinician-scientists who are active collaborators of the PI. Project Narrative Genetic mutations, many of which lead to protein mutations, are often associated with human diseases: they often directly cause diseases or contribute to their progressions. Understanding mechanisms by which these mutations lead to significant functional consequences is of extreme importance to developing effective therapeutics to cure diseases and ameliorate drug resistance.",Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations,9382414,R35GM124952,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biophysics', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Drug resistance', 'Goals', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R35,2017,335245,0.1288804574376976
"Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer ABSTRACT  Next generation genome scale sequencing of patients is now becoming routine for two classes of disease: rare  Mendelian traits and cancer. In favorable cases, these data allow identification of relevant mutations and thus  aid diagnosis and therapy. In both classes of disease, the most common type of mutation is missense -­ single  base  changes  that  result  in  an  amino  acid  substitution  in  a  protein.  Uncertainty  as  to  the  impact  of  these  mutations on in vivo protein activity has resulted in a very conservative approach to their interpretation in the  clinic,  so  causing  many  missed  opportunities  for  targeted  treatment.  The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  use  a  combination of three strategies to make the interpretation of these mutations much more applicable in the clinic.  There are already a large number of computational methods that attempt to determine the impact of missense  mutations on function, and there is substantial evidence that these have useful accuracy. The primary difficulty  is that the accuracy in any particular case is not reliably calibrated. Therefore, our first aim is to use a combination  of these methods to develop an approach focused on more reliable estimates for the probability of high impact  on  protein  function  (i.e.  more  confident  P  values).  The  second  aim  is  to  maximize  the  utilization  of  three-­ dimensional structural information, largely ignored by most computational methods. A large fraction of missense  mutations in these classes of disease act by destabilizing protein structure and knowledge of structure allows  these to be identified with much higher reliability. Also, structure provides a framework for detailed annotation  and comprehension of function. To facilitate the utilization of structure, we will implement a modeling platform  that leverages available experimental information to maximize the structural data available for analyzing mutation  impact.  An  important  aspect  of  the  platform  is  incorporation  of  methods  for  evaluating  the  reliability  of  the  structural features relevant to analysis of each mutation. In the third aim we will build specific functional models  for each protein of interest, integrating information from current databases, the literature, and community input,  so as to provide the richest possible background against which to judge the impact of mutations. Proteopedia, a  well established media wiki for proteins, will be used to provide an integrated view of text, data, and structure. A  key component of the information resource will be contributions from curators, who will provide annotation and  also solicit input from other experts. This aspect of the project builds on experience with other crowdsourcing  endeavors,  including  CASP,  CAGI  and  Proteopedia.    There  will  be  three  primary  outcomes  from  the  project:  First, improved reliability for the interpretation of missense mutations. Second, a prototype mutation annotation  procedure suitable for use in a clinical setting. Third, the resource will provide information of benefit to a range  of other scientists, thus facilitating the analysis of disease related mutations.      NARRATIVE  Genome  scale  DNA  sequencing  is  now  contributing  to  diagnosis  and  therapy  in  cases  of  rare  human  disease and cancer.  Full exploitation of these data is currently hampered by inadequate understanding  of which DNA changes affect protein function so as to contribute to disease. This project aims to develop  the methods and tools needed to remove that obstacle. ",Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer,9356560,R01GM120364,"['AIDS diagnosis', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'crowdsourcing', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'next generation', 'primary outcome', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'wiki']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2017,343120,0.19892642731588644
"Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein tyrosine kinases are dynamic molecular switches that toggle between a catalytically ""on"" and ""off"" state to turn on and off signals responsible for cell growth and survival. While the tyrosine kinase switch is tightly regulated by  diverse array of structural mechanisms in normal states, in many disease states, the switch is permanently turned on or off due, in part, to mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. Although genome sequencing studies have revealed the mutational patterns of tyrosine kinases from many different disease types, understanding the structural and functional impact of these mutations is a challenge because many recurrent mutations occur far from the active site (distal mutations) and the residue networks that contribute to the complex modes of tyrosine kinase allosteric regulation are not fully understood. Our long term goal is to understand the relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in protein kinases using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Our objective in this proposal, which is the next logical step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to delineate the residue interaction networks that contribute to the unique modes of allosteric regulation in tyrosine kinases, and to develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact using the evolutionary and allosteric properties encoded in three dimensional structures. The central hypothesis is that distal mutations alter evolutionarily conserved allosteric networks in tyrosine kinases, and delineating the allosteric networks unique to tyrosine kinases will provide context for predicting and testing disease mutation impact. The specific aims are: * To identify and characterize natural sequence and structural variants associated with tight  allosteric control of tyrosine kinase activity * To develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact on kinase activation and to  experimentally validate computational predictions using selected receptor tyrosine kinases as  model systems Successful completion of these aims is expected to reveal novel activating mutations in putative allosteric sites in the tyrosine kinase domain, and pinpoint key residues and interactions for functional studies. These outcomes, in turn, are expected to have major biomedical impact by accelerating the functional characterization of the mutated tyrosine kinome, which is emerging as a major target for personalized medicine. Finally, by providing detailed mechanistic annotation of mutations identified in genome sequencing studies, this proposal will address a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in translational medicine of converting genomic discoveries into therapeutic strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein tyrosine kinases are a biomedically important class of proteins that are abnormally regulated in many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders, to name but a few. They have been the focus of many drug discovery efforts and genome sequencing studies because of the therapeutic potential of targeting mutated tyrosine kinases for personalized therapy.

"High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation and one of the driving forces of evolution. Both the absolute mutation rate and the relative rate among mutation subtypes fluctuate along the genome, affected by adjacent nucleotide motifs and local features such as GC content and replication timing. Characterizing regional variation of mutation patterns is critical for understanding genome evolution and to identify variants causing genetic diseases. However, mutation rate and molecular spectrum are difficult to measure at high resolution, genomewide, and in an unbiased fashion. Estimates based on common variants and between- species substitutions are confounded by natural selection, population demographic history, and biased gene conversion (BGC). Methods relying on incidence rates of monogenic diseases or finding de novo variants by trio sequencing can inform global trends, but do not provide sufficient data to assess fine-scale local parameters. This study will overcome these limitations by using the extremely rare variants (ERVs) as a new data source to characterize patterns of recent germline variation in humans. ERVs, defined in this study as singletons in 30,000 samples, are becoming available via large-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of population samples. Unlike common variants or substitutions, ERVs arose very recently and are largely unaffected by selection, BGC, etc. We will analyze 200-300 million singleton variants observed in 30,000 subjects at 20-30X coverage. The regional distribution of ERV subtypes will establish a quantitative atlas of the rate and spectrum of human germline mutations mostly unaltered by selection. We will share this resource with the research community and apply it to determine the impact of local genomic features and epigenomic attributes. We will use the systematic departures between ERVs and variants of higher frequencies (polymorphisms and substitutions) to infer local effects of selection, and this may uncover hitherto unknown functional regions of the genome. By comparing mutation signatures in ERVs with those in somatic variations observed in diverse cancers we will attribute distinct mutational signatures to known biochemical processes and thus infer the major contributors to new germline mutations in the human genome. This subtype-specific atlas will also be used to predict the probability of observing every possible single-base mutation in the genome, thus facilitating the interpretation of candidate causal variants of human diseases. We will assess mutation pattern differences among European Americans, African Americans and Latinos, and seek to discover genetic modifiers of germline mutation rate by finding functionally damaging mutations that show increased ERV counts in the surrounding genomic region, potentially identifying both known and previous unknown ""mutator"" genes that play a role in transmission fidelity in humans. This research will provide an essential resource to study the genesis and maintenance of germline mutations in humans. Understanding such a fundamental process will be the basis for a deeper understanding of human evolution and diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will study the patterns of inherited mutations in humans using approximately 250 million extremely rare DNA variants in human populations. Our results will allow the prediction of the rate of new mutations at every site in the genome based on features of the surrounding DNA sequence, thus providing a common resource to study the arrival and maintenance of mutations in humans.

"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross and fine motor delay and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of `Ciliary localization' model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins.

"Tracing the evolution of the human mutation rate ﻿DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All genetic variation is created by mutations, changes that arise due to DNA damage or copying mistakes during DNA replication. Mutations are frequent enough that, on average, a child's 3-billion base pair genome contains 74 new genetic variants that are not present in the genome of either parent. Such new mutations confer a higher disease risk than older mutations because they have not passed the test of surviving through several generations of parents and offspring. We aim to pinpoint how the human mutation rate has evolved as humans left Africa and adapted to diverse new environments across the globe.  One specific aim will follow up on my preliminary research which showed that Europeans experienced a mutation rate change after diverging from Africans and Asians. The primary evidence for this change is that European genomes have a higher burden than African or Asian genomes of the mutation type TCC→TTC, where the trinucleotide ""TCC"" has experienced a mutation from ""C"" to ""T"" at its central site. We wish to and the genetic basis of this mutation rate change by looking at rare variants in mixed- ancestry Latino and African-American individuals. Specially, we will isolate young genetic variants that probably arose via mutation within the past 10-15 generations, after gene ow from Europe into the Americas had already begun. We will infer the genetic background (European, African, or Native American) upon which each new mutation arose and look for genomic regions where European ances- try correlates strongly with an excess of TCC→TTC mutations. These will be the regions most likely to harbor a causal allele that changed the process of mutation accumulation in Europeans. This work has the potential to yield valuable insights into melanoma, a cancer that predominantly affects individuals of European ancestry and whose somatic mutational signature is dominated by TCC→TTC.  A second specific aim is to look for other signatures of mutation rate change that have occurred within the human species or, more broadly, within the great apes. We will use a natural language processing technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify collections of mutation types whose rates appear to be under common genetic control. A few mutation types besides TCC→TTC show weak signals of rate differentiation between populations, and we will attempt to infer how many separate mutation rate change events are necessary to explain these signals. The admixture mapping technique from Specific Aim I can also be adapted to interrogate the genetic basis of other mutation rate changes that might have occurred in the recent past. These efforts should improve our understanding of the human mutation rate's genetic architecture and how mutation rates differ between populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: All genetic variation is created by mutations, the copying mistakes that occasionally happen during DNA replication. There is evidence that children born with a higher burden of new mutations are at increased risk for autism, schizophrenia, and serious congenital diseases [1, 2, 3], but it is not well understood how much the human mutation rate varies and what genetic risk factors affect the mutation rate [4]. We aim to follow up on preliminary evidence that the Europeans have a higher mutation rate than Asians or Africans [5], looking for the genetic basis of this rate difference and investigating how often the mutation rate has changed during human evolution.",Tracing the evolution of the human mutation rate,9117987,F32GM116381,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Americas', 'Architecture', 'Asians', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base Pairing', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Cancer Biology', 'Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collection', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Europe', 'European', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Latino', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Native Americans', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parents', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'admixture mapping', 'base', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'melanoma', 'offspring', 'rare variant', 'rate of change', 'success', 'trait', 'transition mutation']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2016,56118,0.27173171543812696
"Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer ABSTRACT  Next generation genome scale sequencing of patients is now becoming routine for two classes of disease: rare  Mendelian traits and cancer. In favorable cases, these data allow identification of relevant mutations and thus  aid diagnosis and therapy. In both classes of disease, the most common type of mutation is missense -­ single  base  changes  that  result  in  an  amino  acid  substitution  in  a  protein.  Uncertainty  as  to  the  impact  of  these  mutations on in vivo protein activity has resulted in a very conservative approach to their interpretation in the  clinic,  so  causing  many  missed  opportunities  for  targeted  treatment.  The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  use  a  combination of three strategies to make the interpretation of these mutations much more applicable in the clinic.  There are already a large number of computational methods that attempt to determine the impact of missense  mutations on function, and there is substantial evidence that these have useful accuracy. The primary difficulty  is that the accuracy in any particular case is not reliably calibrated. Therefore, our first aim is to use a combination  of these methods to develop an approach focused on more reliable estimates for the probability of high impact  on  protein  function  (i.e.  more  confident  P  values).  The  second  aim  is  to  maximize  the  utilization  of  three-­ dimensional structural information, largely ignored by most computational methods. A large fraction of missense  mutations in these classes of disease act by destabilizing protein structure and knowledge of structure allows  these to be identified with much higher reliability. Also, structure provides a framework for detailed annotation  and comprehension of function. To facilitate the utilization of structure, we will implement a modeling platform  that leverages available experimental information to maximize the structural data available for analyzing mutation  impact.  An  important  aspect  of  the  platform  is  incorporation  of  methods  for  evaluating  the  reliability  of  the  structural features relevant to analysis of each mutation. In the third aim we will build specific functional models  for each protein of interest, integrating information from current databases, the literature, and community input,  so as to provide the richest possible background against which to judge the impact of mutations. Proteopedia, a  well established media wiki for proteins, will be used to provide an integrated view of text, data, and structure. A  key component of the information resource will be contributions from curators, who will provide annotation and  also solicit input from other experts. This aspect of the project builds on experience with other crowdsourcing  endeavors,  including  CASP,  CAGI  and  Proteopedia.    There  will  be  three  primary  outcomes  from  the  project:  First, improved reliability for the interpretation of missense mutations. Second, a prototype mutation annotation  procedure suitable for use in a clinical setting. Third, the resource will provide information of benefit to a range  of other scientists, thus facilitating the analysis of disease related mutations.      NARRATIVE  Genome  scale  DNA  sequencing  is  now  contributing  to  diagnosis  and  therapy  in  cases  of  rare  human  disease and cancer.  Full exploitation of these data is currently hampered by inadequate understanding  of which DNA changes affect protein function so as to contribute to disease. This project aims to develop  the methods and tools needed to remove that obstacle. ",Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer,9156099,R01GM120364,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'crowdsourcing', 'data structure', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'next generation', 'primary outcome', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'wiki']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2016,372928,0.19892642731588644
"Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein tyrosine kinases are dynamic molecular switches that toggle between a catalytically ""on"" and ""off"" state to turn on and off signals responsible for cell growth and survival. While the tyrosine kinase switch is tightly regulated by  diverse array of structural mechanisms in normal states, in many disease states, the switch is permanently turned on or off due, in part, to mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. Although genome sequencing studies have revealed the mutational patterns of tyrosine kinases from many different disease types, understanding the structural and functional impact of these mutations is a challenge because many recurrent mutations occur far from the active site (distal mutations) and the residue networks that contribute to the complex modes of tyrosine kinase allosteric regulation are not fully understood. Our long term goal is to understand the relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in protein kinases using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Our objective in this proposal, which is the next logical step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to delineate the residue interaction networks that contribute to the unique modes of allosteric regulation in tyrosine kinases, and to develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact using the evolutionary and allosteric properties encoded in three dimensional structures. The central hypothesis is that distal mutations alter evolutionarily conserved allosteric networks in tyrosine kinases, and delineating the allosteric networks unique to tyrosine kinases will provide context for predicting and testing disease mutation impact. The specific aims are: * To identify and characterize natural sequence and structural variants associated with tight  allosteric control of tyrosine kinase activity * To develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact on kinase activation and to  experimentally validate computational predictions using selected receptor tyrosine kinases as  model systems Successful completion of these aims is expected to reveal novel activating mutations in putative allosteric sites in the tyrosine kinase domain, and pinpoint key residues and interactions for functional studies. These outcomes, in turn, are expected to have major biomedical impact by accelerating the functional characterization of the mutated tyrosine kinome, which is emerging as a major target for personalized medicine. Finally, by providing detailed mechanistic annotation of mutations identified in genome sequencing studies, this proposal will address a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in translational medicine of converting genomic discoveries into therapeutic strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein tyrosine kinases are a biomedically important class of proteins that are abnormally regulated in many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders, to name but a few. They have been the focus of many drug discovery efforts and genome sequencing studies because of the therapeutic potential of targeting mutated tyrosine kinases for personalized therapy.

"High-resolution map of human germline mutation patterns and inference of mutagenic mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation and one of the driving forces of evolution. Both the absolute mutation rate and the relative rate among mutation subtypes fluctuate along the genome, affected by adjacent nucleotide motifs and local features such as GC content and replication timing. Characterizing regional variation of mutation patterns is critical for understanding genome evolution and to identify variants causing genetic diseases. However, mutation rate and molecular spectrum are difficult to measure at high resolution, genomewide, and in an unbiased fashion.

"Tracing the evolution of the human mutation rate ﻿DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All genetic variation is created by mutations, changes that arise due to DNA damage or copying mistakes during DNA replication. Mutations are frequent enough that, on average, a child's 3-billion base pair genome contains 74 new genetic variants that are not present in the genome of either parent. Such new mutations confer a higher disease risk than older mutations because they have not passed the test of surviving through several generations of parents and offspring. We aim to pinpoint how the human mutation rate has evolved as humans left Africa and adapted to diverse new environments across the globe.  One specific aim will follow up on my preliminary research which showed that Europeans experienced a mutation rate change after diverging from Africans and Asians. The primary evidence for this change is that European genomes have a higher burden than African or Asian genomes of the mutation type TCC→TTC, where the trinucleotide ""TCC"" has experienced a mutation from ""C"" to ""T"" at its central site. We wish to and the genetic basis of this mutation rate change by looking at rare variants in mixed- ancestry Latino and African-American individuals. Specially, we will isolate young genetic variants that probably arose via mutation within the past 10-15 generations, after gene ow from Europe into the Americas had already begun. We will infer the genetic background (European, African, or Native American) upon which each new mutation arose and look for genomic regions where European ances- try correlates strongly with an excess of TCC→TTC mutations. These will be the regions most likely to harbor a causal allele that changed the process of mutation accumulation in Europeans. This work has the potential to yield valuable insights into melanoma, a cancer that predominantly affects individuals of European ancestry and whose somatic mutational signature is dominated by TCC→TTC.  A second specific aim is to look for other signatures of mutation rate change that have occurred within the human species or, more broadly, within the great apes. We will use a natural language processing technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify collections of mutation types whose rates appear to be under common genetic control. A few mutation types besides TCC→TTC show weak signals of rate differentiation between populations, and we will attempt to infer how many separate mutation rate change events are necessary to explain these signals. The admixture mapping technique from Specific Aim I can also be adapted to interrogate the genetic basis of other mutation rate changes that might have occurred in the recent past. These efforts should improve our understanding of the human mutation rate's genetic architecture and how mutation rates differ between populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: All genetic variation is created by mutations, the copying mistakes that occasionally happen during DNA replication. There is evidence that children born with a higher burden of new mutations are at increased risk for autism, schizophrenia, and serious congenital diseases [1, 2, 3], but it is not well understood how much the human mutation rate varies and what genetic risk factors affect the mutation rate [4]. We aim to follow up on preliminary evidence that the Europeans have a higher mutation rate than Asians or Africans [5], looking for the genetic basis of this rate difference and investigating how often the mutation rate has changed during human evolution.",Tracing the evolution of the human mutation rate,8982093,F32GM116381,"['Acceleration', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'African American', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Americas', 'Architecture', 'Asians', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base Pairing', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Cancer Biology', 'Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collection', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Europe', 'European', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Latino', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Native Americans', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parents', 'Pongidae', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'insight', 'melanoma', 'offspring', 'rare variant', 'success', 'trait', 'transition mutation']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2015,50690,0.27173171543812696
"Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein tyrosine kinases are dynamic molecular switches that toggle between a catalytically ""on"" and ""off"" state to turn on and off signals responsible for cell growth and survival. While the tyrosine kinase switch is tightly regulated by  diverse array of structural mechanisms in normal states, in many disease states, the switch is permanently turned on or off due, in part, to mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. Although genome sequencing studies have revealed the mutational patterns of tyrosine kinases from many different disease types, understanding the structural and functional impact of these mutations is a challenge because many recurrent mutations occur far from the active site (distal mutations) and the residue networks that contribute to the complex modes of tyrosine kinase allosteric regulation are not fully understood. Our long term goal is to understand the relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in protein kinases using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Our objective in this proposal, which is the next logical step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to delineate the residue interaction networks that contribute to the unique modes of allosteric regulation in tyrosine kinases, and to develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact using the evolutionary and allosteric properties encoded in three dimensional structures. The central hypothesis is that distal mutations alter evolutionarily conserved allosteric networks in tyrosine kinases, and delineating the allosteric networks unique to tyrosine kinases will provide context for predicting and testing disease mutation impact. The specific aims are: * To identify and characterize natural sequence and structural variants associated with tight  allosteric control of tyrosine kinase activity * To develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact on kinase activation and to  experimentally validate computational predictions using selected receptor tyrosine kinases as  model systems Successful completion of these aims is expected to reveal novel activating mutations in putative allosteric sites in the tyrosine kinase domain, and pinpoint key residues and interactions for functional studies. These outcomes, in turn, are expected to have major biomedical impact by accelerating the functional characterization of the mutated tyrosine kinome, which is emerging as a major target for personalized medicine. Finally, by providing detailed mechanistic annotation of mutations identified in genome sequencing studies, this proposal will address a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in translational medicine of converting genomic discoveries into therapeutic strategies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein tyrosine kinases are a biomedically important class of proteins that are abnormally regulated in many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders, to name but a few. They have been the focus of many drug discovery efforts and genome sequencing studies because of the therapeutic potential of targeting mutated tyrosine kinases for personalized therapy. By providing functional annotation of natural and disease mutations in tyrosine kinases, the proposed studies will accelerate the targeting of mutated tyrosine kinases for drug discovery and personalized therapy.            ",Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases,8984471,R01GM114409,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Allosteric Site', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Survival', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Binding Site', 'Drug Regulations', 'Drug resistance', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Property', 'Protein Kinase', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tyrosine', 'Tyrosine Kinase Domain', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell growth', 'computer framework', 'drug discovery', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'mutant', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'translational medicine']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2015,300000,0.23882880533167664
"Informatics Tools for High-throughput Analysis of Cancer Mutations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large tumor exome sequencing projects have identified a very large number of mutations whose cancer relevance is not yet understood. To begin to address this need, our team has produced two web applications for high-throughput computational analysis of cancer mutations: the Cancer-Related Analysis of VAriants Toolkit (CRAVAT) and the Mutation Position Imaging Toolbox (MuPIT). CRAVAT accepts millions of mutations in a single batch upload and maps mutations from genomic coordinates to annotated transcripts and proteins. MuPIT currently accepts batch uploads of up to 2500 SNVs and maps from genomic coordinates onto X-ray crystal structures of proteins from Protein Data Bank (PDB). We propose to combine and harden CRAVAT and MuPIT into a single web application, in which we will substantially improve the tools, user interface, software infrastructure, integration with external data resources and tools used by the community, and support for protected data. The scope of all tools in the web application will be broadened to handle analysis of the full range of small-scale mutation consequence types found in cancer exomes.  CRAVAT analysis identifies mutations most likely to have deleterious impact on protein function and those that are most likely to confer a selective advantage to cancer cells (drivers), using classifiers developed by our team. Classifier scores are supplemented with annotations, including population allele frequencies, previous occurrence in tumor tissue types, and gene functional categories, enabling filtering (e.g. removing polymorphisms) and prioritization. Gene-level annotation and scoring, by aggregation of classifier scores from mutations in a cohort is also provided.  MuPIT maps mutations from genomic positions onto to protein structures and provides interactive viewing of mutations in the context of protein structure, and in relation to a variety of annotations. To enable prioritization of interesting mutations and genes, the application provides a preview describing each structure and all available annotations (e.g., binding sites, experimental mutagenesis results, polymorphic and disease- associated variants that have been previously documented). After selecting a PDB of interest, the user is led to an interactive visualization page. An enhanced Jmol applet displays all SNVs mapped onto the structure. Frequently, many SNVs in the input list can be mapped onto a single structure, revealing clustering patterns around key functional sites.  Based only on word-of-mouth, since the debut of the two applications in August 2012, CRAVAT has been utilized by 129 unique users from 39 countries, and it has analyzed 1,136 submitted jobs, totaling 27.9 million mutations. MuPIT has been utilized by 242 unique users from 25 countries, with 720 submitted jobs. (Source: Google Analytics).

"Rewiring the yeast brain:  Redundancy and interference in genetic networks    DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant)   Abstract: Similar to neural networks in animals, molecular networks in cells can generate bistable or oscillatory dynamics that maintain memories of previous events (e.g. epigenetic switch) or order periodic events (e.g. cell cycle), respectively. In cells, networks of genes interacting with one another through regulatory feedback implement such dynamics. Analogous to learning in brains, cells can """"learn"""" correlations in their environmental signals by encoding such correlations into their gene network dynamics through mutation, a """"re-wiring"""" process that occurs on the timescale of generations. The issue of learning the statistical regularities and correlations of environmental signals is best exemplified by the evolution of """"circadian clocks"""", which are oscillatory gene circuits that have learned to internalize the 24-hour light-dark circadian cycle. Strikingly, circadian clocks have evolved independently multiple times, which suggests there exists some selection pressure and/or evolutionary mechanism that repeatedly favor the convergent evolution of autonomous oscillation. The hypothesis of my research proposal is that certain types of loss-of-function mutations in duplicated genes (known as dominant-negative mutations) can easily generate bistability and oscillation in existing regulatory networks. Gene duplication followed by a loss-of-function mutation can generate a dominant-negative. A dominant negative mutation is a partial loss-of-function mutation that renders a gene duplicate functionally inactive, yet still capable of interacting with the original duplicate, the upstream effectors, and/or downstream targets. Thus, dominant-negatives can easily interfere with the proper regulation and activity of the original duplicate. Because both gene duplication and loss-of-function mutations occur frequently in evolution, this presents an evolutionary mechanism for rapidly generating bistability and autonomous oscillation in gene regulatory networks. My proposed research over the next five years will integrate experiment and theory to understand the extent to which gene duplication and dominant-negative mutations facilitate the evolution of epigenetic switches and circadian clocks in regulatory networks. We will use computer simulation and an experimental directed evolution approach in a tractable, model eukaryote (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to test the ability of cells to learn the statistical regularities of their coupled environmental signals. Understanding how and why single-cell microbes and parasites have learned to predict their environment is essential for understanding their future evolution to changing host conditions.   Public Health Relevance: The ability of parasites to learn and adapt to changing host conditions and environments presents a challenge to human health. The objective of my research proposal is to understand the capacity of gene networks in single cells to learn and predict the statistical regularities of their environment. Discovering the limitations and abilities of parasites to evolve and anticipate changes in their host environment will be invaluable for the treatment of many human diseases.       n/a",Rewiring the yeast brain:  Redundancy and interference in genetic networks,8146626,DP2OD008654,"['Animals', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Dominant-Negative Mutation', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gene Duplication', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Parasites', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Yeasts', 'abstracting', 'brain cell', 'circadian pacemaker', 'directed evolution', 'duplicate genes', 'human disease', 'loss of function mutation', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'theories']",OD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,DP2,2011,2355000,0.09025332074677267
"Informatic profiling of clinically relevant mutation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our group focuses on genetic variants that disrupt molecular functions that cause human disease. In this renewal R01 application, we propose to begin the process of realizing our long-term goals, and to expand our original scope of research to include the challenge of understanding genetic disease mutations and polymorphisms that affect gene expression regulation in noncoding regions. Additionally, we have formed collaborations with genetic data managers and will apply these methods to aid in their research and identify new testable hypotheses. We will do this in three aims. First, we will integrate predictions of protein-disease associations with mutation predictions to develop a new quantitative model of genotype and phenotype. Second, we will integrate each of these together to develop a systems level, molecular function genome annotator with functionality to import into the genome databases. Finally, we will continue to build new methods for characterization of mutations using sequence, function and structure and begin testing our published hypotheses.

"Informatic profiling of clinically relevant mutation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Informatic profiling of clinically relevant mutation      Many approaches have been developed to predict whether a mutation associated with a disease is actually causative. In contrast to other approaches to predicting deleterious mutations, our approach, called in silico functional profiling, starts with learning residue-specific protein function and then estimates when it is disrupted. This research will continue our efforts to characterize what the underlying molecular disruption a mutation is causing and thereby improve accuracy of these approaches. We will do this by building a database that links clinical observation with molecular phenotype and using this to develop bioinformatic models of mutation. This is particularly relevant to cancer, since many mutations in cancer are both poorly understood and simply associated with cancer. The hypothesis of this proposal is that computational methods that predict a specific residue function using protein sequence and structure can classify known disease-associated mutations based on their function better than existing computational methods, and less expensively than experimental assays. In short, we will describe each phenotypically annotated mutation as possibly affecting catalysis, protein interactions, posttranslational modification and stability of the protein. The structural environments around disease associated mutations can be characterized using a combination of computational biochemical methods based on first principles of biomolecular structure and function and statistical informatics methods. We will continue this research by implementing the following steps: First, we will build a database of how often mutations in cancer, pharmacogenetics, Mendelian and complex disease are disrupted by phosphorylation, stability, catalysis, protein interaction and other posttranslational modifications. Second, we will build a bioinformatic model of disruption using machine learning methods trained with these and other commonly used features. Finally, we will link these to clinical observation by annotating disease causing mutation with an ontology of diseases and integrate these predictions into databases of mutation.

"Population Genetics Theory    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Four areas of theoretical population genetics will be studied.

We shall study how the pattern of interaction between deleterious mutations evolves as a function of the mutation rate, the recombination rate, and the degree of fitness loss of each mutation. We shall also study buildup of statistical association between genes that influence culturally transmitted traits that are associated either through transmission or through fitness. The second area of study concerns the evolution of pathogens such as influenza. Here we build models to predict the accumulation of mutations during epidemics and pandemics in a way that can assist in guiding vaccination strategies. We will develop algorithms that search for potential recombinants and reassortants among a collection of up to 1000 viral sequences.

"Modeling of Protein Complexes and Missense Mutations Amino acid mutations in human proteins are often associated with inherited predispositions to specific diseases. Yet most observed missense polymorphisms, those involving a single nucleotide change leading to a changed amino acid, have not been characterized in terms of their effects on protein structure and function. We hypothesize that many of the most deleterious missense mutations affect protein function in one of two ways: 1) by altering interaction of proteins with other molecules, including other proteins, DMA, and small ligands; or 2) by altering stability of the protein. Both of these mechanisms depend primarily on the location of the mutation and its physical properties: changes in protein interactions are usually caused by mutations in or very near to a binding site; changes in stability are usually caused by mutations of buried hydrophobic residues. The aim of this proposal is to develop a computational system for predicting the functional effects of missense mutations through homology modeling of protein complexes. New functional data on 1000 random mutations in two dimeric enzyme systems will be obtained to train and test the model.

Cancer is usually linked to a number of genetic changes, some inherited and others somatic. These include loss of DNA-damage repair, breakdown of cell-cycle checkpoints, and resistance to apoptosis.

"Informatic profiling of clinically relevant mutation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Informatic profiling of clinically relevant mutation      Many approaches have been developed to predict whether a mutation associated with a disease is actually causative. In contrast to other approaches to predicting deleterious mutations, our approach, called in silico functional profiling, starts with learning residue-specific protein function and then estimates when it is disrupted. This research will continue our efforts to characterize what the underlying molecular disruption a mutation is causing and thereby improve accuracy of these approaches. We will do this by building a database that links clinical observation with molecular phenotype and using this to develop bioinformatic models of mutation. This is particularly relevant to cancer, since many mutations in cancer are both poorly understood and simply associated with cancer. The hypothesis of this proposal is that computational methods that predict a specific residue function using protein sequence and structure can classify known disease-associated mutations based on their function better than existing computational methods, and less expensively than experimental assays. In short, we will describe each phenotypically annotated mutation as possibly affecting catalysis, protein interactions, posttranslational modification and stability of the protein. The structural environments around disease associated mutations can be characterized using a combination of computational biochemical methods based on first principles of biomolecular structure and function and statistical informatics methods. We will continue this research by implementing the following steps: First, we will build a database of how often mutations in cancer, pharmacogenetics, Mendelian and complex disease are disrupted by phosphorylation, stability, catalysis, protein interaction and other posttranslational modifications. Second, we will build a bioinformatic model of disruption using machine learning methods trained with these and other commonly used features. Finally, we will link these to clinical observation by annotating disease causing mutation with an ontology of diseases and integrate these predictions into databases of mutation.

"Population Genetics Theory    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Four areas of theoretical population genetics will be studied. In the first, we will develop mathematical and statistical framework for studying the evolution of genes that affect how other sets of genes interact with one another. This theory helps in understanding conditions under which the genome can be expected to become modular in its production of phenotypes, as well as when synergy between mutations in different genes should be produced by evolution. We shall study how the pattern of interaction between deleterious mutations evolves as a function of the mutation rate, the recombination rate, and the degree of fitness loss of each mutation. We shall also study buildup of statistical association between genes that influence culturally transmitted traits that are associated either through transmission or through fitness. The second area of study concerns the evolution of pathogens such as influenza. Here we build models to predict the accumulation of mutations during epidemics and pandemics in a way that can assist in guiding vaccination strategies. We will develop algorithms that search for potential recombinants and reassortants among a collection of up to 1000 viral sequences. Here we aim to devise a statistical test to indicate whether identified recombinants or reassortants are spurious or statistically significant. Our recent theory of niche construction will form the basis of studies of how pathogens might evolve in response to human actions that they induce, such as use of antibiotics. The final research area will develop multiple-gene models for sex-linked control of genomic imprinting. These will include cis and trans modifiers of imprinting. Fertility selection as well as sex- specific viabilities will be studied in order to clarify the role of multiple paternities, which has been proposed as a driving force in the evolution of genomic imprinting. Genomic data from mammalian species will be analyzed using tools from statistical learning in order to predict which genes are likely to be imprinted.

"Modeling of Protein Complexes and Missense Mutations Amino acid mutations in human proteins are often associated with inherited predispositions to specific diseases. Yet most observed missense polymorphisms, those involving a single nucleotide change leading to a changed amino acid, have not been characterized in terms of their effects on protein structure and function. We hypothesize that many of the most deleterious missense mutations affect protein function in one of two ways: 1) by altering interaction of proteins with other molecules, including other proteins, DMA, and small ligands; or 2) by altering stability of the protein. Both of these mechanisms depend primarily on the location of the mutation and its physical properties: changes in protein interactions are usually caused by mutations in or very near to a binding site; changes in stability are usually caused by mutations of buried hydrophobic residues. The aim of this proposal is to develop a computational system for predicting the functional effects of missense mutations through homology modeling of protein complexes. New functional data on 1000 random mutations in two dimeric enzyme systems will be obtained to train and test the model. The primary application of this computational system will be to genes associated with the development of cancer.

"Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts Project Summary The success of the ongoing battle with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) depends crucially on the availability of effective diagnostics, vaccines, antibody therapeutics, and small-molecular drugs. Although SARS-CoV-2 mutates slower than the viruses that cause the flu and the common cold, it has had more than 8300 observed single mutations on its genome of 29,900 nucleotides by June 1, 2020. We show that these mutations might have devastating effects on COVID-19 diagnostics, vaccines, antibody therapeutics, and small-molecular drugs (J. Chem. Inf. Model. In press). We will develop new artificial intelligence (AI) to forecast SARS-CoV-2 future mutations. Leveraging on state-of-art methods developed under the present R01 award, we will design mutation- resistant vaccines, antibody therapeutics, and small-molecular drugs. The CPUs and GPUs requested in this supplement will be essential for my lab to continue the research of the present R01 award and to apply the methods developed in this award to attack fundamental problems in combating COVID-19. Project Narrative The project concerns the forecasting of SARS-CoV-2 mutations and the design of mutation- resistant vaccines, antibody therapeutics, and small-molecular drugs using artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced mathematics.

"The adaptive potential of translational regulation Project Summary/Abstract  Our current understanding of the adaptive effects of mutation is largely limited to alterations in protein coding sequence and disruption of transcriptional cis-regulatory promoters. Very little is known about how mutations alter translation, or the role these mutations play in adaptation and evolution. This project seeks to address this gap by identifying the functional effect of mutations on translation. To accomplish this I will first identify mutations that arise from adaptation to various nutrient limited environments. I will then use expression profiling (e.g. RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and RATE-seq) to identify the effect these mutations have on translation, as well as other levels of gene expression. This will provide insight into the magnitude of effect mutations have on translation and their relative rate. Furthermore, to fully characterize the role synonymous mutations have on fitness I will be using a deep scanning synonymous mutation library. To understand the role tRNA abundance plays in the fitness effect of a given synonymous mutations, I will also be evaluating fitness within tRNA under- and over-expression backgrounds. Because of the closely coupled nature of translation rates and mRNA decay, I will also characterize the effect synonymous mutations have on mRNA decay using RATE-seq. My analysis of the functional effects of these mutations on gene expression, particularly within the genetic background and environment in which they arose, will allow for the development of a machine learning algorithm that can use sequence and annotation features to predict the effect of a mutation on gene expression. This tool will aid future research into the effect mutations have of gene expression by allowing the identification of high-confidence candidates for further evaluation.  This project will be conducted at New York University’s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, whose mission is to answer otherwise intractable biological questions using applied experimental and computational approaches. The Center houses numerous facilities and cores that will be instrumental in the performance of this work. The collaborative atmosphere and multi-disciplinary nature of NYU’s research communities that will enable me to stay abreast of developments in related fields and to rapidly communicate my research to interested parties. I will be trained under the guidance of Dr. David Gresham, an excellent researcher working on complementing long-term evolution experiments with gene expression studies to characterize the adaptive potential of the regulation of gene expression. Project Narrative The translation of mRNA into protein is a critical step in gene expression that is tightly regulated with mis-regulation of translation being a hallmark of many human pathologies. Understanding how mutations can alter the regulation of translation is an understudied but important aspect of adaptation and evolution. Ultimately, without an understanding of the adaptive potential of translation we have an incomplete, and imperfect, picture of the underlying genetic causes of numerous forms of cancer and genetic diseases.",The adaptive potential of translational regulation,9893712,F32GM131573,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Pathology', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Nutrient', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Pathology', 'Performance at work', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transfer RNA', 'Translation Initiation', 'Translational Regulation', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cancer genetics', 'collaborative environment', 'driver mutation', 'environmental change', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'insight', 'interest', 'mRNA Decay', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'preservation', 'promoter', 'response', 'ribosome profiling', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,65310,0.180002142616604
"Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations Project Summary Although a quickly expanding catalogue of protein mutations have been discovered, including those that cause human diseases or confer drug resistance, mechanistic understanding and prediction of functional consequences of these mutations remain rather limited. There is a critical need to develop novel, multiscale computational frameworks that are rigorous and generalizable to help close the ever-increasing gap between phenotypic data and mechanistic knowledge about the mutations and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.  My long-term research goals are two folds: (1) to unravel how a change in protein sequence ripples through various aspects of molecular and system-levels to a change in cellular function and cause human diseases or confer drug resistance; and (2) to translate learned mechanistic knowledge to effective drug-design strategies for human diseases and drug resistance. Toward these goals I propose to advance and combine the strengths of computational molecular biology (structural modeling and design for proteins or protein interactions) and computational systems biology (pathway/network-level topology and dynamics) and follow a novel, formal paradigm to develop methods that systematically identify mechanisms underlying various stages of consequence propagation (from conformation, molecular and system-level variables, to cellular functions, where intermediates can be skipped if necessary). In the forward direction of propagating consequences, I will determine, explain and understand mutational consequences at various levels with machine learning, causal analysis, and combinatorial optimization, starting with known or modelled changes at various levels. In the inverse direction of designing consequences, I will follow known or learned mechanistic hypotheses and develop efficient combinatorial optimization methods to design mutagenesis experiments or screen / design ligands for desired perturbations at various levels, which would test and refine corresponding hypotheses directly and translate mechanistic hypotheses to therapeutic strategies. Mechanisms underlying distal (potentially allosteric) mutations, multiple mutations within a protein or across proteins as well as systems pharmacology strategies will also be rigorously determined in the process.  The expected outcomes from the innovative project will include two main components. The first will be both biophysical principles of proteins and integrative understanding of biomedical systems, which will be organized in a database for public access. The second will be translating mechanistic insights into therapeutic intervention strategies to treat diseases. In particular, targeted experiments (mutagenesis or ligand-binding) will be designed following known or discovered mechanistic hypotheses. This project will involve close collaboration with structural biologists and clinician-scientists who are active collaborators of the PI. Project Narrative Genetic mutations, many of which lead to protein mutations, are often associated with human diseases: they often directly cause diseases or contribute to their progressions. Understanding mechanisms by which these mutations lead to significant functional consequences is of extreme importance to developing effective therapeutics to cure diseases and ameliorate drug resistance.",Unraveling molecular and system-level mechanisms of human disease-associated protein mutations,10007852,R35GM124952,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biophysics', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Drug resistance', 'Goals', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R35,2020,335245,0.1288804574376976
"Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations ABSTRACT During normal development, aging, and diseases such as cancer, DNA damage due to endogenous and external factors, and repair defects result in accumulation of different types of somatic mutations including single nucleotide substitutions, small InDels, copy number alterations, translocations, and ploidy changes. While a vast majority of somatic mutations in the genome are not disease drivers, their patterns of genetic changes and associated context can provide insights into past exposure to mutagens, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair defects, and extent of genomic instability, which are important for understanding disease etiology, minimizing hazardous environmental exposure, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies such as immunotherapy. A number of mutation signatures have been identified based on local sequence contexts to address this need. But, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair preferences depend on both local sequence and epigenomic contexts, and it remains to be understood whether epigenomic contexts of emerging mutation signatures can provide critical, complementary etiological insights at a genome-wide scale, which are not apparent from sequence contexts alone. This is of fundamental importance, because (i) etiology of many of the emerging mutation signatures is currently unknown, (ii) DNA damage response and repair depends on tissue contexts, and defects in core DNA repair genes often result in cancer development in tissue-specific manner, and (iii) differences in the extent of DNA damage and repair between stem and differentiated cells within the same tissues have consequences for aging and disease incidence rates. Built logically on our previous works, we propose to develop computational approaches to determine the impact of epigenomic contexts on the patterns of somatic mutations within and across tissue types, and validate computational predictions using targeted experiments. In Aim-1, we will develop an epigenomic context preference map for emerging mutation signatures. In Aim-2, we will determine the basis of tissue-dependent differences in mutation profiles attributed to DNA repair defects. In Aim-3, we will predict the extent of cell lineage-dependent patterns of mutation accumulation from the mutational landscape of terminal cells. I am currently an early stage investigator, and the proposal is aligned with my long-term goal to identify fundamental principles of mutability and evolvability of somatic genomes. Our project will deliver novel resources and knowledge for addressing questions regarding genomic integrity during development and aging, and diseases such as cancer. ! PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will use computational biology approaches to determine epigenomic context preference for somatic mutations, and use that to infer tissue-dependent changes in mutation patterns. Our results will provide fundamental insights into aspects of genome maintenance, which is important for advancing our understanding of cancer etiology, reducing exposure to mutagenic factors, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies. !",Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations,9902467,R01GM129066,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Relapse', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagens', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Ploidies', 'Point Mutation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'computer framework', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome integrity', 'genome-wide', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'repaired', 'response', 'stem', 'stem cells', 'tissue stem cells', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,RBHS -CANCER INSTITUTE OF NEW JERSEY,R01,2020,324350,0.1708585813745905
"Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein tyrosine kinases are dynamic molecular switches that toggle between a catalytically ""on"" and ""off"" state to turn on and off signals responsible for cell growth and survival. While the tyrosine kinase switch is tightly regulated by  diverse array of structural mechanisms in normal states, in many disease states, the switch is permanently turned on or off due, in part, to mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. Although genome sequencing studies have revealed the mutational patterns of tyrosine kinases from many different disease types, understanding the structural and functional impact of these mutations is a challenge because many recurrent mutations occur far from the active site (distal mutations) and the residue networks that contribute to the complex modes of tyrosine kinase allosteric regulation are not fully understood. Our long term goal is to understand the relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in protein kinases using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Our objective in this proposal, which is the next logical step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to delineate the residue interaction networks that contribute to the unique modes of allosteric regulation in tyrosine kinases, and to develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact using the evolutionary and allosteric properties encoded in three dimensional structures. The central hypothesis is that distal mutations alter evolutionarily conserved allosteric networks in tyrosine kinases, and delineating the allosteric networks unique to tyrosine kinases will provide context for predicting and testing disease mutation impact. The specific aims are: * To identify and characterize natural sequence and structural variants associated with tight  allosteric control of tyrosine kinase activity * To develop a computational framework for predicting mutation impact on kinase activation and to  experimentally validate computational predictions using selected receptor tyrosine kinases as  model systems Successful completion of these aims is expected to reveal novel activating mutations in putative allosteric sites in the tyrosine kinase domain, and pinpoint key residues and interactions for functional studies. These outcomes, in turn, are expected to have major biomedical impact by accelerating the functional characterization of the mutated tyrosine kinome, which is emerging as a major target for personalized medicine. Finally, by providing detailed mechanistic annotation of mutations identified in genome sequencing studies, this proposal will address a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in translational medicine of converting genomic discoveries into therapeutic strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein tyrosine kinases are a biomedically important class of proteins that are abnormally regulated in many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders, to name but a few. They have been the focus of many drug discovery efforts and genome sequencing studies because of the therapeutic potential of targeting mutated tyrosine kinases for personalized therapy. By providing functional annotation of natural and disease mutations in tyrosine kinases, the proposed studies will accelerate the targeting of mutated tyrosine kinases for drug discovery and personalized therapy.",Functional Annotation of Natural and Disease Variants in Tryosine Kinases,10145865,R01GM114409,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Allosteric Site', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Survival', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Binding Site', 'Drug resistance', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Property', 'Protein Kinase', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tyrosine', 'Tyrosine Kinase Domain', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell growth', 'computer framework', 'drug discovery', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'molecular dynamics', 'mutant', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive test', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'translational medicine']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2020,9815,0.23882880533167664
"A statistical framework to systematically characterize cancer driver mutations in noncoding genomic regions PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer genomes typically harbor a substantial number of somatic mutations. Relatively few driver mutations actually alter the function of proteins in tumor cells, whereas most mutations are considered to be functionally neutral passenger mutations. Over the past decade, the search for cancer driver mutations has focused on coding regions and several mutational significance algorithms have been developed for coding mutations. The contribution of mutations in noncoding regulatory regions to tumor formation largely remains unknown and current mutational significance algorithms are not designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions, due to biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations. The emerging availability of large whole- genome sequencing datasets (e.g. PCAWG and HMF datasets) creates an ample opportunity to develop new mutational significance algorithms that are particularly designed for the interpretation of noncoding regions. Recently, we have developed a new statistical approach that identifies driver mutations in coding regions based on the nucleotide context. Critically, consideration of the nucleotide context around mutations does not require prior knowledge for functional consequences associated with these mutations. Hence, we hypothesize that generalizing our nucleotide context model to noncoding regions will uncover novel noncoding driver mutations that cannot be detected using the mutational significance approaches currently available. For this purpose, we will develop a statistical framework that incorporates the biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations and that is specifically designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions. Specifically, we will consider the context-dependent distribution of passenger mutations, modeling of the background mutation rate, accurately partition the background mutation rate, model the sequence composition of the reference genome, and account for coverage fluctuation. We will then combine these statistical components by computing an independent product of their underlying probabilities. We will derive a significance p-value using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach, and use FDR for multiple hypothesis test correction. This strategy will allow us to accurately estimate the significance of somatic mutations in noncoding genomic regions. We will next apply this statistical framework to whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients, thereby deriving a comprehensive list of candidate driver mutations in noncoding regions. Finally, we will investigate whether noncoding mutations are overrepresented in transcription factor binding sites, regulate gene expression levels, induce alternative splicing, or affect epigenomic states. Upon the completion of this project, we will have developed and applied a statistical framework for discovery of significant somatic mutations in noncoding regions, and defined the mutational landscape of the non-coding cancer genome. All aspects of the methods developed and applied in this project will be made open source and developed in an online platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE While coding cancer driver mutations have been characterized in detail over the past decade, the contribution of noncoding mutations to tumor formation remains - apart from few examples (e.g. mutations in TERT promoters) - largely unknown.

"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks. Since many human diseases are caused by mutations that affect molecular interactions, this research will expand our understanding of the underlying basis of disease and will provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.",Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes,9896829,R01GM076275,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,312660,0.09471285026053601

"A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions Project summary There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mutations are preferentially targeted to the variable (V) regions of the Immunoglobulin (Ig) loci during somatic hypermutation (SHM). The persistence of this gap has limited our understanding of the mutagenic mechanisms involving activation-induced deaminase (AID) in the immune response and in the role of AID in mis-targeting mutations leading to B-cell lymphomas and other cancers. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the global targeting of mutations in immunity that are required to protect us from infections. As high-throughput data from human antibody immune responses became available, it provided us with new opportunities to generate hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of SHM. We now propose to generate further hypotheses using computational models applied to additional databases and to validate these hypotheses using cellular and animal experiments. Our objective is to understand what directs SHM across the many human Ig heavy chain V-regions. Our central hypothesis is that the V-region SHM process is highly dependent on a DNA sequence signature(s) that drives mutations in a largely deterministic fashion. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary results using human in vivo data from a few human V region genes and has begun to be validated using independent databases and experiments in human B cell lines. The rationale is that evaluations of computational data based upon biological mechanisms, together with appropriate biological experiments, will reveal the key differences between IGHV regions (IGHV 3-23, 4-34, 1-18, 1-02, etc.) that lead to the dominance of each of those V regions in the responses to medically important antigens. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) identify the extent to which a DNA signature determines the mutation process in four individual human IGHV genes that are important in disease responses; 2) examine the relationship between AID hotspots and Polη hotspots across all the other human V region genes, thus rigorously defining a mutation targeting signature. Both aims will also entail studying human V region genes and modifications of them in human cell lines and in mice expressing a human V region to further confirm the signature and identify molecular mechanisms in vivo. Our approach is innovative because the computational models we are proposing will be mechanistically motivated focusing on the interaction between AID and Polη hotspots, thus testing molecular mechanisms as opposed to classic statistical models using whole V region sequences that ignore the underlying biology. In addition, to focus on mechanisms we will leverage new high-throughput data from human V regions that have not undergone antigen selection. Our results will be highly relevant to human IgV repertoire analyses from immune responses that are currently hard to interpret and will help future vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, as well as help to understand mutations in human malignancies where AID plays a key role. Project narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the targeting of AID-mediated mutations across many human heavy chain V-regions will make it possible to develop vaccines that will lead more rapidly to better and more broadly protective antibodies to infectious agents and reveal the risk factors in the development of B-cell malignancies and gastric and other solid tumors where AID is implicated.",A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions,10090262,R01AI132507,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Experiments', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B lymphoid malignancy', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene-Modified', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Heavy-Chain Immunoglobulins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Knock-in', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stomach', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'activation-induced cytidine deaminase', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'density', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'neutralizing antibody', 'recruit', 'repair enzyme', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'vaccine response']",NIAID,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,38074,0.1515667632202808

The rationale is that evaluations of computational data based upon biological mechanisms, together with appropriate biological experiments, will reveal the key differences between IGHV regions (IGHV 3-23, 4-34, 1-18, 1-02, etc.) that lead to the dominance of each of those V regions in the responses to medically important antigens. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) identify the extent to which a DNA signature determines the mutation process in four individual human IGHV genes that are important in disease responses; 2) examine the relationship between AID hotspots and Polη hotspots across all the other human V region genes, thus rigorously defining a mutation targeting signature. Both aims will also entail studying human V region genes and modifications of them in human cell lines and in mice expressing a human V region to further confirm the signature and identify molecular mechanisms in vivo. Our approach is innovative because the computational models we are proposing will be mechanistically motivated focusing on the interaction between AID and Polη hotspots, thus testing molecular mechanisms as opposed to classic statistical models using whole V region sequences that ignore the underlying biology. In addition, to focus on mechanisms we will leverage new high-throughput data from human V regions that have not undergone antigen selection. Our results will be highly relevant to human IgV repertoire analyses from immune responses that are currently hard to interpret and will help future vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, as well as help to understand mutations in human malignancies where AID plays a key role. Project narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the targeting of AID-mediated mutations across many human heavy chain V-regions will make it possible to develop vaccines that will lead more rapidly to better and more broadly protective antibodies to infectious agents and reveal the risk factors in the development of B-cell malignancies and gastric and other solid tumors where AID is implicated.",A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions,9882227,R01AI132507,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Experiments', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B lymphoid malignancy', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene-Modified', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Heavy-Chain Immunoglobulins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Knock-in', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stomach', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'activation-induced cytidine deaminase', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'density', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'neutralizing antibody', 'recruit', 'repair enzyme', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'vaccine response']",NIAID,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,591815,0.1515667632202808
"Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome Project Summary Congenital ataxia presents in early childhood with non-progressive hypotonia, gross motor, fine motor and cognitive delays. These disorders are distinct from the progressive ataxias because of the presence of congenital cerebellar malformations and because they are typically inherited recessively. Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) constitute a major subset of these conditions, consisting of a cerebellar midline (vermis) malformation, a nearly pathognomonic Molar Tooth sign on brain Imaging (MTI) and co-existent oculomotor apraxia and episodic breathing dysrhythmias. In our published data, we have: 1] Identified ten unique genetic causes of JSRD (nearly half of the published causes), 2] Generated genotype-phenotype correlations involving cerebellar, retinal, renal, hepatic, digit, and cerebral manifestations. 3] Identified common founder mutations that allow for population-based screening. 4] Discovered that JSRD encoded proteins frequently localize to the cilium. 5] Identified ciliary transition zone (TZ) defects in cells with JSRD mutations. 6] Performed siRNA cell-based screens for defective ciliogenesis to prioritize candidate JSRD genes. 7] Generated and characterized multiple zebrafish, mouse and human cell culture models for JSRD. 8] Defined the concept of ‘Ciliary localization’ model, in which one JSRD gene is required for ciliary localization of other JSRD proteins. In our unpublished data we have: 1] Recruited an additional 200 JSRD patients without molecular diagnosis. 2] Performed whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on an additional 100 JSRD families. 3] Identified an additional 12 novel likely JSRD candidate genes. 4] Generated IPSCs and cerebellar organoids from mutation-positive and negative families to aid in functional analysis and gene discovery using RNAseq. 5] Begun functional validation of the putative mutations. 6] Developed methods to interrogate ciliary structure in a high-throughput fashion with electron microscopy (EM). The goal of this competing renewal is to identify the remaining ‘discoverable’ genes that lead to JSRD when lost, functionally validate mutations within the pathogenetic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in JSRD genes lead to collapse of the ciliary TZ. Because the majority of patients still have unknown cause of disease, this renewal aims to advance knowledge through molecular characterization of new genes, using newly evolving high-throughput techniques, integrated bioinformatics, and a unique resource of consanguineous families recruited world-wide. We further aim to validate these mutations in patient cells, within a mechanistic framework that JSRD genes are required for essential ciliary structural components during cerebellar development. Project Narrative Joubert syndrome is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder unified by defects of the cellular primary cilium. This work will identify new genetic causes and dissect ciliary defects associated with genetic mutations.",Molecular Characterization of Joubert Syndrome,9988508,R01NS048453,"['Apraxias', 'Ataxia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar malformation', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebrum', 'Cilia', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Cognitive', 'Congenital cerebellar hypoplasia', 'Cultured Cells', 'Cytoplasmic Granules', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Embryo', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Family', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hepatic', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Joubert syndrome', 'Kidney', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Middle East', 'Modeling', 'Molar tooth', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Muscle hypotonia', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Organoids', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Sonication', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Termination of pregnancy', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Training', 'Transmission Electron Microscopy', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'WNT Signaling Pathway', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'accurate diagnosis', 'affection', 'base', 'cell type', 'cilium biogenesis', 'cohort', 'consanguineous family', 'disorder subtype', 'early childhood', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'fetal', 'founder mutation', 'gene discovery', 'genetic testing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'loss of function mutation', 'malformation', 'mutant', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'population based', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'screening', 'stem cell biology', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,510012,0.1674593459736752
