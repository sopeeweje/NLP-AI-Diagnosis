"Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare Project Summary There is a sharp and increasing imbalance between the number of children with autism in need of care and the availability of specialists certified to treat the disorder in its multi-faceted manifestations. The autism community faces a dual clinical challenge: how to direct scarce specialist resources to service the diverse array of phenomes and how to monitor and validate best practices in treatment. Clinicians must now look to solutions that scale in a decentralized fashion, placing data capture, remote monitoring, and therapy increasingly into the hands of families. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and large amounts of labeled human emotion computer vision data, we have developed a solution for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glasses and Android smartphones to deliver real time social cues to individuals with autism in the child’s natural environment. We hypothesize that this informatic system can provide real-time therapy in a way that scales to meet the demand of the growing population of autism families, including underserved minorities, while growing data that can be used to measure progress over time and in the development of novel AI. Our first aim will focus on the development of a deep learning model that enables dynamic emotion recognition in the real world, and on domain adaptation procedures that enable minimal manual labeling to personalize the model for optimal accuracy on the individuals with whom the child will interact most regularly at home. Our second aim will focus on the human computer interface, namely the design of the user experience with the Android application that controls the sessions run on the Google Glass wearable. We will work our clinical colleagues and with groups of autism families to develop and enhance a set of games and activity modes that create social engagements ideal for emotion therapy, including an emotion capture and a charades game. The third aim will test our central hypothesis that the Glass system can create a therapy-to-data feedback loop that delivers clinical care while growing data for measurement and model development. We will work with up to 200 children ages 4-8 who have recent autism diagnoses and do not have access to standard behavioral therapy. We will build a community of autism families through crowdsourcing techniques, befitting the mobile paradigm embodied by our work, and through close collaboration with behavioral therapy providers, the autism outreach organization Autism Speaks, and the digital healthcare company, Cognoa. The families will work with us on design and refinement of our “Superpower Glass” system for fit, engagement, and function of use for both therapy and data capture. Importantly, we will send units home with families to use the device for at least 3 twenty-minute sessions per week for a minimum of 6 weeks. This remote period will generate a massive database to quantify overall social learning, emotion comprehension, eye contact, and sustained social acuity. In all, our work program will show that mobile wearable AI can bring the social learning process out of the clinic and into the real world for faster and more adaptive intervention. Project Narrative There is a sharp and growing imbalance between the number of clinical care providers available and the number of children with an autism diagnosis that leave most children without therapy until after critical periods in development have passed. We intend to address this problem through creation of a machine learning-enabled wearable that brings effective care to the home and empowers both parents, patients, and clinicians with mobile solutions that personalize care delivery to dramatically improve children’s outcomes. The Superpower Glass system, which delivers social cues to children during real-time interactions and provides several engagement modes for families, is a promising solution that enables greater access to care for families across the US, and potentially, across the globe.!",Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare,9716320,R01LM013083,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Support', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Self-Direction', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Variant', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'applied behavior analysis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'combat', 'critical period', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'model development', 'novel', 'outreach', 'personalized care', 'phenome', 'practical application', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'underserved minority', 'user-friendly']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,677664,-0.024283058281462717
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Clinical Deterioration in Hospitalized Children PROJECT SUMMARY Children who are admitted to the hospital and experience deterioration have a high risk of mortality and poor long-term health. Current warning early scores indicating risk of deterioration are subjectively derived and have not reduced in-hospital mortality. In recent work, I developed a vital sign based statistical model that demonstrated improved accuracy over current risk scores at predicting clinical deterioration in hospitalized children 24 hours in advance. Within adults, the combination of longitudinal data analysis techniques, machine learning, and electronic health record (EHR) data have led to highly accurate early warning scores. Therefore, my aim in this grant proposal is to utilize longitudinal integration of EHR data in a machine learning framework to develop a model for predicting clinical deterioration in hospitalized children as early as possible. I will do this by first deriving and validating a prediction model using structured EHR data collected from three pediatric hospitals (Aim 1). Using the same cohort, I will then build and validate a prediction model using features derived from unstructured clinical notes (Aim 2). I will also compare if the addition of unstructured features improves the prediction accuracy of the model derived in Aim 1. Finally, I will determine the association between non-patient level environmental variables within the hospital ecosystem and risk of clinical deterioration in hospitalized children (Aim 3). I will also determine if the addition of these environmental risk factors improves performance of the prediction model derived through Aims 1 and 2. Completion of this proposal will result in a validated pediatric risk prediction model that will enable clinicians to recognize early signs of deterioration in hospitalized children. This will facilitate timely intervention, thereby saving lives and improving long-term health. In addition, this grant will also provide me with crucial data for a future R01 trial aimed at assessing the impact of the prediction model in reducing mortality, decreasing costs, and improving long-term outcomes in hospitalized children. To establish myself as an independent investigator in pediatric prediction modeling, I propose a training plan that includes comprehensive didactics and mentorship in the areas of longitudinal data analysis, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and concepts in pediatric care. I have assembled a first-class mentorship team comprised of national experts in longitudinal data analysis techniques and EHR-based machine learning (Robert Gibbons PhD and Matthew Churpek MD, PhD). My advisory team is comprised of experts in natural language processing (Dmitriy Dligach PhD), clinical decision support around deterioration events (Dana Edelson MD, MS and Priti Jani MD), and pediatric early warning scores (Christopher Parshuram MB., ChB., D. Phil., FRACP). By completing my research and career development goals, I will develop into an independent expert investigator in developing pediatric prediction models for ultimately improving outcomes in hospitalized children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical deterioration in hospitalized children is associated with high-risk of mortality as well as complications in their long-term health. An improved prediction model capable of identifying pediatric patients at risk of clinical deterioration as early as possible can facility timely and proper intervention, thereby decreasing preventable death and improving long-term outcomes in hospitalized children.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Clinical Deterioration in Hospitalized Children,9805481,K01HL148390,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Intervention', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalized Child', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'control trial', 'cost', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'pediatric patients', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'research and development', 'risk prediction model', 'tool', 'trend', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K01,2019,147563,0.01924715004502637
"Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings Project Summary In low and middle-income countries (LMICs) pneumonia is by far the leading cause of death among children < 5 years of age. Despite progress in reducing global pneumonia deaths, pneumonia still kills over 1 million children a year. A key factor is the challenge of pneumonia diagnosis. Chest X-Ray is the gold standard for pneumonia diagnoses but exposes children to ionizing radiation and is mainly restricted to hospital settings. Outside of hospitals, pneumonia is diagnosed based on clinical grounds using the WHO’s Integrated Management of Childhood Illness algorithms. However, that approach lacks specificity, resulting in significant overdiagnosis of pneumonia. That wastes precious resources, exposes children to antibiotics unnecessarily, and delays identification of the true cause of a child’s illness. Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in bedside ultrasound as a radiation-sparing alternative to X- Ray. The accuracy of bedside US for diagnosing pneumonia is comparable to X-Ray. However, traditional bedside US suffers the same limitations as X-Rays in terms of portability, and still requires interpretation of images by a trained radiologist. Recent innovations in ultrasound technology and artificial intelligence applications suggest a possible pathway forward. Bluetooth enabled US transponders that connect to a smart phone or tablet, effectively create a truly portable US suite that can fit into one’s pocket. Similarly, advances in artificial intelligence render possible the automated interpretation of mobile bedside US (mBSUS) images on a smart phone, obviating the need for a radiologist. The twin goals of this project are: 1) to compare the accuracy of the mobile, Bluetooth US system, linked to a cell phone, against the gold standard of Chest X-Ray for diagnosis of pneumonia among children aged 1-59 months; and 2) to apply machine learning algorithms to assist in the identification of accurate classification features that reliably identify lobar pneumonia. If successful, this would be a pivotal first step towards the goal of a truly portable yet still highly accurate approach to the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia that could function autonomously without the need for external evaluation by a skilled radiologist. Such a tool would revolutionize pneumonia case management in resource limited parts of the world and could save the lives of many. Project Narrative Pneumonia remains the leading cause of death for children <5 years around the world. A key barrier is the lack of affordable and portable imaging systems. In this project, we will 1) test the accuracy of a mobile ultrasound system that connects to a smart phone via blue tooth against the gold standard of chest X-Ray, and 2) use machine learning algorithms to automate the diagnosis of pneumonia, thereby obviating the need for external review by a radiologist.",Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings,9773427,R21TW011343,"['5 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Aorta', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blinded', 'Bluetooth', 'Breast Feeding', 'Breathing', 'Case Management', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest wall structure', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Convulsions', 'Coughing', 'Cyanosis', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Lethargies', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pediatric Radiologist', 'Pleura', 'Pneumococcal Pneumonia', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Regional Anatomy', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Diaphragm', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unconscious State', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vomiting', 'Zambia', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'drinking', 'health training', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'portability', 'radiologist', 'smartphone Application', 'tool', 'wasting']",FIC,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2019,199220,0.014252695347082265
"Nasal biomarkers of asthma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects 9.3% of children and 8.0% of adults in the US. Mild to moderate asthma can be difficult to diagnose and manage given waxing and waning symptoms. The airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation that underlie asthma are challenging to assess regularly and easily. Given the accessibility of the nose for assessment and monitoring, it is clinically and scientifically compelling to identify nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. To date, several lower airway pathogens have been associated with asthma. In separate studies, host gene expression in the airway has been associated with asthma. Host and microbes undoubtedly interact in asthma. A nasal biomarker that could accurately identify mild/moderate asthma and provide information on host vs. microbial contributions and their relative causality to disease would be highly useful for clinical care and research. We hypothesize that causal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma can be identified through network-based examination of nasal gene expression and microbiota. We will recruit subjects with mild/moderate asthma, severe asthma, and controls from whom we will generate the first paired system-wide profiles of host and microbiome in asthma. In Aim 1, we will focus on host characterization and identify nasal transcript biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma by RNA-sequence profiling of nasal brushings, differential gene expression analysis, and machine learning. In Aim 2, we will perform the first study of the nasal microbiome in asthma to identify nasal microbial biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. We will generate 16S rRNA data from nasal swabs to identify bacterial taxa associated with mild/moderate asthma, apply metagenomic inference to ascertain their functions, perform metagenomic sequencing for identification of non-bacterial taxa, and apply machine learning to distinguish microbial classifiers of mild/moderate asthma. We will be the first to reconstruct bacterial functions associated with asthma through metagenomic inference, and the first to apply metagenomic sequencing to well- characterized asthmatics. In Aim 3, we will identify causal nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma through data-driven, network approaches that integrate genetic, transcriptome, microbiome, and clinical data. We will link host to microbiome by constructing interaction networks, characterize the association between genetic variation and gene expression by eQTL detection, and infer causal drivers of mild/moderate asthma through Bayesian network construction. We will project asthma-specific subnetworks onto our networks, and compare our networks to those for other respiratory diseases to identify coherent modules of genes and microbes dysregulated in asthma. In all aims, we will assess for relevance to asthma more broadly by testing for the identified biomarkers in nasal and bronchial samples from severe asthmatics. We expect that our results will lead to the development of a nasal test that can be used for the clinical management and investigation of mild/moderate asthma, a prevalent disease that is currently suboptimally diagnosed and managed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma impairs quality of life and leads to emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and sometimes death in people of all ages and walks of life. To identify noninvasive, predictive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we will comprehensively profile and examine nasal gene expression and the nasal microbial community in subjects with mild/moderate and severe asthma. We will use computational biology to construct networks that reflect the interactions and interconnectivity of host and microbes in asthma, and identify nasal biomarker candidates that we expect will lead to a nasal test for asthma.",Nasal biomarkers of asthma,9675213,R01AI118833,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', '3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Network-based', 'Nose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Waxes', 'airway inflammation', 'airway obstruction', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'bronchial epithelium', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'decision tree learning', 'epidemiologic data', 'fungus', 'genetic analysis', 'host microbiome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'nasal microbiome', 'nasal microbiota', 'pathogen', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus identification']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,665560,0.09796373503614768
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"Automatic Rib Fracture Detection in Pediatric Radiography to Identify Non-Accidental Trauma ABSTRACT Automatic Rib Fracture Detection in Pediatric Radiography to Identify Non-Accidental Trauma PI: Adam M. Alessio Non-accidental trauma caused by physical abuse is a leading cause of death in children in the United States. Because rib fractures are highly predictive of child abuse and chest radiographs are commonly performed for multiple indications, pediatric chest radiographs can have a critical role in the identification of abuse. Detection of rib fractures on pediatric radiographs is challenging and a high percentage of fractures are missed, particularly in imaging centers with limited pediatric radiology experience. Currently, there are no viable computer assisted strategies for rib fracture detection on chest radiographs. The purpose of this proposal is to develop machine learning methodology to detect rib fractures on pediatric radiographs using images from a network of hospitals. These methods will rely on a two-stage approach including a thoracic cavity segmentation stage followed by a fracture detection stage. We will explore two fracture detection strategies using novel supervised learning approaches: a heterogeneous U-net and a multi-modal regional-convolutional neural network. These methods will be trained and tested with a large set of fracture-absent radiographs (N=1000) from Seattle Children's Hospital and a diverse set of labelled fracture-present radiographs (N=500) from collaborating sites. These methods will be developed with an intentionally diverse set of radiographs, representative of the variety of fracture presentations and image quality in clinical practice, in order to position this rib fracture detection method for rapid translation to clinical practice. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to provide a computer assisted rib fracture assessment tool that would be a rapid and widely-available add-on to all pediatric chest radiograph exams, improving detection of rib fractures and potentially leading to improved identification of child abuse. NARRATIVE Automatic Rib Fracture Detection in Pediatric Radiography to Identify Non-Accidental Trauma PI: Adam M. Alessio Child abuse is a leading cause of death in children and rates of abuse are increasing.

"Secondary data analysis of universal autism screening in a large primary care network: The impact of early autism screening on age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention (R03) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently highlighted the lack of studies examining universal autism screening in primary care and whether it leads to earlier diagnosis and treatment. This gap prevented them from being able to recommend universal autism screening until there is more evidence. CHOP has successfully implemented universal autism screening in primary care – 83% screening compliance in 2016, and has both screening and follow-up primary care available in the electronic health record. This proposal is for a secondary analysis of this data to directly answer the question of whether universal screening results in earlier identification and earlier treatment entry for children with autism. Preliminary analyses on 13,503 children found the sensitivity of the M-CHAT was surprisingly low -- 40% (specificity 94%, positive predictive value 16%, and negative predictive value of 98%). These results show that, with only one screen, more children with autism screened negative (n=198) than screened positive (n=128). This project will include a sample double this size (as more children age into the 4-6 year age range), and include the wealth of data within the EHR to accomplish two aims. Aim 1 will determine the age of diagnosis and entry into early intervention for children in a universal autism screening program. Many factors contribute to the age of diagnosis and intervention, but this dataset can answer three important questions: First, to determine the age of diagnosis and entry to intervention for children with autism who screened positive as toddlers at the first v. second screen (“true positives”). Second, to determine the age of diagnosis and early intervention for children who screened negative but went on to be diagnosed with autism (“false negatives”), since negative screening results can still lead to heightened awareness of milestones. Third, to explore the age of diagnosis and intervention for screened v. unscreened children, since a subset of children were not screened (approximately 17% of well-child visits, as well as some number of children who received sick care but did not present for well-child visits). Aim 2 will identify factors that would improve screening accuracy, and then create and validate a clinical decision tree. Pediatricians use clinical judgment to interpret screening results—this project can provide much needed evidence. Variables such as autism risk factors (e.g., family history); child demographic, medical, and developmental factors; family variables including socio-economic status and parent concerns; and practice-level variables including patient population demographics, provider years of experience, provider compliance with screening, and provider rates of referrals, could inform clinical judgment. Upon successful completion, this project will contribute the exact type of evidence from universal screening in primary care requested by the USPSTF, as well as provide guidance for pediatricians on how to fine tune their interpretation of screening results. This can significantly impact the age of diagnosis and intervention, by revealing for whom screening is and is not working well. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will analyze existing data from the highly successful universal autism screening program in our large primary care network. Our data can answer critical questions about the age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention for children screened in primary care. We can also determine whether child, family, provider, and practice variables can be used to more accurately interpret early autism screening results.","Secondary data analysis of universal autism screening in a large primary care network: The impact of early autism screening on age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention (R03)",9762199,R03MH116356,"['Academy', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'American', 'Awareness', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Industry Standard', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Philadelphia', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States', 'Visit', 'aged', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'classification trees', 'control trial', 'decision tree learning', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'group intervention', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'patient population', 'pediatrician', 'premature', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'regression trees', 'rural setting', 'screening', 'screening program', 'secondary analysis', 'standard of care', 'urban setting']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R03,2019,86000,-0.020920024642648676
"Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data, Modeling, and Coordination Center (DMCC) for the NHLBI's Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network. The objective of PrecISE is to conduct sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials with precision interventions in stratified patient with severe asthma populations. Patients with severe asthma are heterogeneous, and thus a hard to treat population. Precision medicine interventions, which focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients instead of the best treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this complex patient population. The PrecISE Network is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating Clinical Center investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for PrecISE trials. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include PrecISE information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other key features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to PrecISE by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the PrecISE Network. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for the execution of high-impact, sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials in the PrecISE Network, which can lead to the establishment of potential personalized treatment approaches for patients with severe and/or exacerbation-prone asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe asthma affects 10% of people worldwide, and despite currently available treatments, asthma remains poorly controlled for many patients. The National Institutes of Health is funding a new iteration of previous high- impact asthma clinical trials networks, which will take a personalized medicine approach to identify new therapies for severe asthma, tailored to an individual patient using data-based treatment algorithms that leverage information on his/her individual disease and treatment history. Our proposal is to provide leadership and statistical research support to this network.","Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network",9762973,U24HL138998,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calendar', 'Case Report Form', 'Certification', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Files', 'Data Reporting', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Gills', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Online Systems', 'Operations Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Writing', 'asthma exacerbation', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'data management', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'material transfer agreement', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'random forest', 'recurrent neural network', 'repository', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2019,3319382,0.04675424901581135
"Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings Abstract Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare resources. Treatment of diarrhea is mostly empiric, with antibiotic use mostly based on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from antibiotic use, and inappropriate use leads to toxicity and resistance. Furthermore, despite the increasing availability of rapid molecular testing, there is little data to base a decision of whom or when to test. Our overarching goal is to develop and validate clinical decision tools for management of diarrheal illnesses in children of both high and low resource settings. We will utilize prospectively-collected data from two recently-completed multicenter cohort studies of pediatric diarrhea. These studies feature extensive etiologic testing, well-characterized clinical elements, and longitudinal outcome data. We have assembled a team with expertise in pediatric diarrhea, clinical prediction rules, and machine learning methods. In Aim 1, we will use domestic data to develop and validate: a) a score for bacterial etiology, and b) a score for which patients are likely to benefit from further testing. We will derive the scores using data from IMPACT, an NIH-sponsored study of 1200 children from 5 US Emergency Departments, and validate using electronic health records from the Utah Intermountain Health System. In Aim 2, we will use international data to develop and validate: a) a diagnostic score for bacterial etiology, and b) a prognostic score for risk stratification of children who go on to poor outcomes. We will derive the scores using data from GEMS, a study of over 9400 children across 7 low-resource countries, and validate using VIDA study of children in 3 African countries. Completion of the Aims will result in the availability of a number of clinical tools that healthcare workers worldwide can use for evidence-based care of children with diarrhea. Project Narrative Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The management of childhood diarrhea often depend on what type of pathogen is responsible, but in many cases testing is not affordable or feasible.

"Validation of Physiologic CPR Quality Using NOn-inVasive Waveform Analytics (CPR-NOVA) Project Abstract  Pediatric cardiac arrest affects thousands of children each year. Progressive heart and lung failure is a predisposing cause in many of these events. Despite improvements in survival outcomes over the past two decades, more than half of these children still do not survive. As new brain injury complicates care among survivors, the burden to these children and the public's health is substantial.  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) – the medical procedure of providing chest compressions and ventilations during cardiac arrest – saves lives, and higher quality CPR is more effective at doing so. One method to improve CPR quality is through the use of CPR quality monitoring defibrillators. By providing real- time feedback on CPR mechanics targets such as chest compression depth and rate, they represent the best patient care option currently available to improve CPR performance. Unfortunately, most of these devices are either not approved for children or use pads that are too large for many pediatric patients. Thus, current technology limits the benefit of meaningful CPR quality monitoring to a small percentage of the children who suffer a cardiac arrest. Given the strong association between pediatric CPR quality and outcomes, new methods to monitor CPR quality are urgently needed to improve the care of this vulnerable population.  Physiologic-directed CPR is a promising technique that uses the hemodynamic response of the patient to guide the ongoing resuscitation effort. This approach overcomes the technological limitations of existing CPR quality monitoring technology by using data from patient monitors. Unfortunately, because many patients do not have intra-arterial lines in place at the time of arrest to guide CPR, its clinical impact has been limited. To overcome this limitation, the objective of this ancillary application is to leverage the existing infrastructure of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-funded Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) and the unique hemodynamic waveform database of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded parent R01 – the ICU-Resuscitation (ICU-RESUS) Project – to validate two noninvasive physiologic CPR monitors applicable to nearly every pediatric cardiac arrest: 1) end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2); and 2) PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) obtained via pulse oximetry. Using sophisticated machine learning methods, a prospective observational analytic investigation is proposed with the following Aims: 1) Evaluate ETCO2 as a noninvasive CPR quality monitor among children receiving at least 1 minute of CPR in a CPCCRN intensive care unit; and 2) Using novel machine learning classification algorithms, evaluate PPG and other candidate physiologic waveforms as noninvasive CPR quality monitors.  By leveraging the substantial infrastructure of the CPCCRN, the novel hemodynamic waveform database of ICU-RESUS, and advanced machine learning analytics, this submission represents a unique opportunity to validate two noninvasive physiologic pediatric CPR quality monitors to improve clinical care and save lives. !

"Optimizing Usability of the Orally Rehydrate Children at Home Mobile Application - Optimize ORCAH Project Summary/Abstract Acute gastroenteritis (AGE)--infectious diarrhea—is a common condition that is costly in the US and high- mortality in developing nations. The cornerstone of AGE management is oral rehydration therapy (ORT), an evidence-based technique that has saved over 54 million lives in the 50 years since its introduction. The problem we aim to address is ORT’s underuse in developed countries—specifically in the home setting. If widely adopted, ORT could reduce 80% of AGE-related healthcare visits and costs among children, eliminating 1.3 million emergency department visits and $1.5 billion in hospital costs annually. The product of this Phase I proposal is a minimum viable product of a mobile health application (app)--ORCAH (Orally Rehydrate Children at Home)—that guides caregivers of dehydrated children through administering ORT in the home. ORCAH's innovation is in the use of the mobile device's native functions for analytics, database parameters, timers, notifications, and process state—for a novel aim: making ORT accessible in the home setting in developed countries. We hypothesize we will achieve an effectiveness (percentage of ORT tasks completed) of 80%. We will achieve our objective through 3 Aims: Aim 1. Use key informant interviews with card sort testing to explicitly understand subjects’ prioritization of ORT workflow tasks and how to deliver these in a user- centered design interface, and thereby develop the optimal information architecture of ORCAH. Aim 2. Perform cycles of iterative, user-centered design using a synchronous remote platform to optimize the app’s usability. Aim 3. Pilot test ORCAH in a simulation context to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a trial of the app using synchronous online methods. Based on the impact of ORT in developing settings, the gap presented by the absence of an intervention for improving home ORT use in developing countries, and the match between the key advantages of mobile health apps and the ORT underuse problem, we expect that the ORCAH app will provide a usability-optimized, effective and efficient technology for supporting home ORT delivery that will ultimately allow users to avoid costly and inconvenient ED visits. Objectives for Phase II include trialing ORCAH’s efficacy compared to usual care and further developing ORCAH to include a cloud-based machine learning algorithm that will continuously optimize the parameters of ORT dosing for each user based on patient- generated data and will provide generalizable evidence about ORT dosing. The long-term goals are to further develop the machine-learning functionalities to update best practices for ORT, and to develop ORCAH for developing settings. The market for ORCAH—caregivers of children with AGE—represents a promising commercial potential, as about 57.9 million children in the US experience an AGE episode annually of at least 24 hours duration. Data2Care’s commercialization strategy includes direct business-to-consumer marketing, as well as co-marketing with business partners including after-hours advice centers, rehydration fluid companies and urgent care centers. Project Narrative  Acute gastroenteritis—infectious diarrhea—is a high-mortality condition in developing nations, where a public health intervention called oral rehydration therapy (ORT) has saved over 54 million lives and is considered the cornerstone of management; however, ORT is underused in developed nations including the United States, resulting in an estimated excess of 1.3 million emergency department visits by children and $1.5 billion in hospital costs for children annually. Through developing a mobile health application—ORCAH (Orally Rehydrate Children at Home)—that guides caregivers of dehydrated children through giving ORT in the household setting, we expect that this application will enhance health and reduce illness in the short term by enabling users to avoid costly and inconvenient emergency department visits, and the associated costs. In the long term, through adding a cloud-based machine learning algorithm to ORCAH that will continuously optimize the parameters of ORT dosing for each user based on patient-generated data, we expect to generate generalizable evidence about ORT dosing parameters that will improve the science, delivery and efficacy of ORT.",Optimizing Usability of the Orally Rehydrate Children at Home Mobile Application - Optimize ORCAH,9906781,R41HD101158,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colorado', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diarrhea', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Fostering', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Visit', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Household', 'IV Fluid', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Notification', 'Oral', 'Oral Rehydration Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Engineering', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'User-Computer Interface', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatric trauma', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health intervention', 'recruit', 'simulation', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'urgent care', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NICHD,"DATA2CARE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R41,2019,145682,0.021171442857102422
"Perinatal Origins of Asthma Project Abstract  Early in life many children develop wheezing which can be a sign of early-onset asthma. Yet, not all children who experience wheezing episodes develop asthma. Predicting asthma that begins early in life is important as those who develop early-onset asthma are more likely to have persistent symptoms and structural changes to the lung. Identification and early intervention of high risk individuals could prevent long term lung function abnormalities and provide an alternative to costly treatment. To date, risk prediction models for early- onset asthma are limited mainly to clinical history and presentation. Additionally, no one model contains both reliable sensitivity and specificity or clinically valid serological predictors for early-onset asthma.  Our laboratory has focused previously on immunologic responses to common asthmatic triggers, house dust mite (HMD) and cockroach allergens, between individuals and how these responses differ between populations and outcomes. We have identified increased lymphoproliferation and cytokine response (IL-13) in allergen-stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) derived from individuals who are atopic or African- Americans. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan, stimulate the cytokine production of IL-13 and IFN-γ. In this proposal our preliminary data indicate that the production of IL-13 after allergen exposure in CBMCs is associated with exposure to different microbiota. In addition, early exposure to Moraxellaceae greatly enhances IL-13 production by CBMCs after exposure to HDM. Taken together, our data suggest that early-life bacterial exposure may enhance the production of cytokines that can alter host physiology and immunity.  In this translational medicine proposal, we will build a predictive model for early-onset asthma that will be applicable to general and high risk populations. Our approach will include high-throughput techniques to assess bacterial exposure and immunologic response in the perinatal time period. We will integrate the large amount of data generated into a pipeline with machine learning algorithms that will be regulated specifically for the prediction of later onset of disease. In addition, we will assess bacterial exposure in association with mothers who carry risks for asthma development in their children. The proposed studies will address both the need of predictive model for early-onset asthma and identify bacterial-host interactions associated with high risk populations (e.g. maternal risk factors). Together, these studies form the platform for multidisciplinary training in microbe- immune interactions, predictive risk for asthma, bioinformatics and form a solid foundation to launch a successful career as a physician- scientist. Project Narrative Asthma is the most common chronic disorder of childhood. Early-onset asthma, if left untreated, leads to long term respiratory dysfunction, and currently, no clinical tools reliably aid in prediction of asthma. Therefore, this proposal aims to develop a predictive model for asthma involving microbial and immune interactions that will be applicable to the general and high risk populations.",Perinatal Origins of Asthma,9755494,F30HL136001,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic rhinitis', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Bacterial DNA', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dictyoptera', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemophilus', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Interferon Type II', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mononuclear', 'Moraxella', 'Moraxellaceae', 'Mothers', 'Obesity', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Peptidoglycan', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Pyroglyphidae', 'Recording of previous events', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Solid', 'Streptococcus', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States', 'Wheezing', 'airway remodeling', 'asthma model', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'care costs', 'career', 'cockroach allergen', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'individual response', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiota', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'persistent symptom', 'predictive modeling', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'respiratory colonization', 'respiratory health', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'smoking during pregnancy', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F30,2019,50016,0.08854984363204584
"An unobtrusive monitoring device used for tracking asthma symptoms and lung function variability Project Summary/Abstract The application's broad, long-term objective is to develop, evaluate and commercialize a device for continuous monitoring of a child's asthma components (symptoms, lung function variability, nighttime awakenings, etc.) over a few weeks. Asthma is the most common pediatric chronic condition in the US. It affects 6 million children, causes 0.8 million emergency department (ED) visits, 0.13 million hospitalizations and $18 billion annually in healthcare costs. To reduce the burden of uncontrolled asthma, NHLBI evidence-based guidelines require periodic assessment of the child's asthma risk/impairment, and corresponding adjustments to treatment, until asthma control has been established. When assessing asthma impairment, pediatricians depend heavily on the self-report, which is unfortunately unreliable. This leads to underestimation of asthma impairment, undertreatment, and long paths to achieving control. To efficiently and effectively establish asthma control, a wearable device could be used to provide pediatricians an accurate, recent history of asthma components. Currently, no practical solutions exist for weeks-long monitoring of symptom frequency and lung function variability, both of which are critical components for assesing asthma impairment. Via the following Specific Aims, this application will use advances in embedded systems and machine learning to develop a small, wearable device for monitoring asthma symptoms that is (1) acceptable to patients; (2) able to robustly detect cough and wheeze symptoms; and (3) able to passively measure lung function variability. Specific Aim 1: Train and evaluate an algorithm to detect pediatric asthma symptoms (cough and wheeze) on a low power, small form factor wearable device. Specifications: 90% sensitivity; false alarm rate: 1 cough epsiode/day or 1 wheeze episode/day. Evaluate algorithm against medical expert (physician) scoring using the two best available asthma scoring tools (AS: asthma score; PRAM: Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure). Specific Aim 2: Design and evaluate algorithm to detect lung function variability on a low power, small form factor wearable device. Specifications: Using respiratory signals from sensor patch, detect variations ≥ 10% in forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC). Evaluate algorithm against spirometry gold standard. Project Narrative Uncontrolled pediatric asthma is a serious public health concern. There are proven therapies and management guidelines to achieve asthma control in most patients, but poor patient self-report of asthma daily symptoms and components has made this an elusive goal in practice. This project will develop and evaluate a wearable device that provides physicians with an accurate report of their patient's recent asthma symptoms and pulmonary function variability.",An unobtrusive monitoring device used for tracking asthma symptoms and lung function variability,9774468,R41HL146027,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Coughing', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'New England', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Office Visits', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Periodicity', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spirometry', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Vital capacity', 'Wheezing', 'asthmatic patient', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'design', 'diaries', 'efficacy study', 'evidence based guidelines', 'follow-up', 'monitoring device', 'off-patent', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatrician', 'phase 2 study', 'preference', 'programs', 'prototype', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NHLBI,"CLAIRWAYS, LLC",R41,2019,204205,0.07936577096892737
"A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors PROJECT ABSTRACT Advances in acute care have decreased short-term mortality of sepsis, resulting in an increasing number of survivors who experience significant morbidity and mortality. Recurrent infections account for 60% of hospital readmissions after sepsis and are an important cause of long-term mortality. Identifying sepsis survivors at risk for infections and understanding predisposing factors are therefore important first steps to develop personalized interventions to improve long-term outcomes. The overall research goal is to develop innovative targeted interventions to improve long-term outcomes after sepsis. This proposal focuses on identifying subgroups of sepsis survivors (phenotypes) at high risk for infection-related hospital readmissions and deaths. It is hypothesized that the combination of host factors, disease characteristics, and interventions prior to and during sepsis will identify distinct phenotypes that are captured by clinical data. These clinical phenotypes likely have distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms (e.g., immunosuppression), predispose to different outcomes (e.g., recurrent infections), and patients with the same phenotype may respond similarly to targeted interventions such as immunomodulation. In Aim 1, three nationally representative datasets of sepsis survivors will be assembled and analyzed by machine learning techniques to identify valid clinical sepsis phenotypes. In Aim 2, phenotypes at high-risk for infection-related readmissions and deaths at 6 months will be identified, and underlying biomarker profiles for these phenotypes analyzed. In Aim 3, these high-risk phenotypes will be used to conceptualize and simulate an adaptive platform trial designed to test the efficacy of three different immunomodulatory drugs. An adaptive trial design was chosen, because it can test multiple interventions simultaneously and reduces the chances of exposing patients to ineffective or harmful interventions. The research plan is augmented by expert mentoring and rigorous didactic training. Together, this will provide the candidate with essential career development skills in the science of precision medicine, including machine learning methodologies, Bayesian statistics, and innovate clinical trial design. This proposal has potentially groundbreaking implications for the future treatment of sepsis survivors, because it deviates from the current “one-size fits all” approach and attempts to create the framework for personalized interventions. This framework sets the stage for future independent investigator (RO1) applications evaluating personalized treatments in adaptive clinical trials, and will uniquely position the candidate as a future leader in the field of long-term outcomes after critical illness. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is important for public health because sepsis is a life-threatening infection that affects 30 million people worldwide each year. Long-term outcomes for patients who survive a hospital admission for sepsis are poor, and many patients develop new disabilities or worsening of preexisting health conditions. This proposal supports the NIH’s mission to enhance health and reduce illness and disability by trying to identify interventions for sepsis survivors at highest risk for poor outcomes.",A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors,9718511,K23GM132688,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Interleukin-7', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Outcome', 'PDCD1LG1 gene', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Recombinants', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Sepsis', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'trial design']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2019,189327,0.03741072850853936
"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design. The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis. ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",9626417,R01HD087363,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergent care', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data registry', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electronic registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient registry', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'risk prediction model', 'septic patients', 'support tools', 'wasting']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,616807,0.02067065845989951
"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration. Project Narrative Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases remains a leading cause of death in both children and adults worldwide, yet no clinical tools have ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. The proposed research will both develop and validate an innovative new mobile phone based platform for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents, and older children with acute diarrhea. This new mobile health tool will help physicians, nurses, and other providers worldwide to determine the best management strategies for patients with acute diarrhea, potentially improving and rationalizing care for the hundreds of millions of patients each year presenting to healthcare facilities around the world with acute diarrhea.",Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease,9771462,R01DK116163,"['5 year old', 'Acute Diarrhea', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bangladesh', 'Beds', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'IV Fluid', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'International Unit', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Provider', 'Rehydration Solutions', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diarrheal disease', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'international center', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2019,556605,0.016142454255505447
"Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood PROJECT SUMMARY This K08 proposal describes a comprehensive training program tailored to the career development of the candidate. The candidate is a physician who recently completed a clinical fellowship in Allergy and Immunology and whose research contributions to date have addressed early-life risk factors for childhood asthma and allergy with a focus on the diet and intestinal microenvironment. Asthma and environmental allergies have increased in prevalence and asthma is now the most common chronic disease in children. The increased occurrence of asthma and allergy has been attributed to changes including dietary shifts and dysbiosis, though contributory factors are incompletely defined and interventions to prevent asthma and allergy remain elusive. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (FA) have well-defined immunologic effects, and the ratio of omega-6:omega-3 FA intake has increased concurrently with the increase in allergic disease. However, reported associations of PUFA with asthma and allergy in childhood are inconsistent. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that effects of PUFA are impacted by host genotype and the intestinal microbiota. Our scientific goal is to examine these omics to identify determinants of when a safe and inexpensive intervention, intake of PUFA, is effective in reducing asthma and allergy in childhood. We will utilize data from 6- and 7-year-old participants in three study populations: Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), Project Viva and Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC). We have three specific aims: (1) Identify gene by omega-3 FA interactions in asthma and allergy in childhood; (2): Define the contributions of intestinal bacteria and metabolites to associations of omega-3 FA dietary intake with asthma and allergy in childhood; and (3) Characterize clinically relevant childhood plasma PUFA profiles using unsupervised classification methods and integrative machine learning algorithms. Our findings could lead to cost-effective and personalized approaches to asthma and allergy reduction by elucidating which individuals benefit from dietary PUFA supplementation and whether microbiota-modifying therapies could boost protective responses to PUFA. The candidate proposes to execute this research plan alongside a training and development plan including hands-on bioinformatics instruction and preparation for independent mechanistic and clinical R01-level follow-up projects. The proposed work will be mentored by Dr. Scott Weiss, a Professor at Harvard Medical School and a leader in environmental, nutritional and genetic asthma risk factors. The candidate will obtain additional scientific input and career guidance from a team including a co-mentor and three scientific advisors with expertise in asthma epidemiology, lipid mediators of allergic inflammation, multi-omics analysis and translational research methods. This proposal represents a natural continuation of the candidate’s prior experience and will provided the support needed for her to become an independent investigator with a focus on precision medicine approaches to asthma and allergy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are dietary fats with effects on immune function and inflammation, and the genes that a person is born with or the bacteria that live in one’s gut could influence how the body processes and responds to PUFA. We will study children to see if having particular gene variants or specific gut bacteria or chemicals impacts how PUFA intake relates to risk of asthma and allergy. Understanding how genetic, microbial, and other factors influence PUFA processing and asthma and allergies could lead to new cost- effective ways to prevent and treat these increasingly common and clinically burdensome diseases.",Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood,9804142,K08HL148178,"['3 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergic inflammation', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Asthma', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Availability', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary Fatty Acid', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Fellowship', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Instruction', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Multiomic Data', 'Omega-3 Fatty Acids', 'Omega-6 Fatty Acids', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D supplementation', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Wheezing', 'Work', 'antenatal', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'defined contribution', 'dysbiosis', 'environmental allergy', 'experience', 'fatty acid supplementation', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'immune function', 'learning strategy', 'lipid mediator', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'metabolome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multiple omics', 'nutrition related genetics', 'personalized approach', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'professor', 'response', 'skills', 'study population', 'western diet']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2019,170640,0.09893111179924126
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9650623,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical predictors', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'stroke risk', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2019,535600,0.021643949912048356
"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,9717307,R01MH104030,"['Advertisements', 'Age', 'Anniversary', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'brain abnormalities', 'caudate nucleus', 'comparison group', 'critical period', 'dexterity', 'follow-up', 'habit learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical attention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomenological models', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'secondary analysis', 'vector']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,683541,0.026603378336026936
"Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia Reading instruction prompts the emergence of neural circuits that are specialized for rapidly translating printed symbols into sound and meaning. Understanding how these circuits differ in children with dyslexia, and change with learning, is an important scientific challenge that holds practical implications for education. The proposed research employs longitudinal measurements in children with dyslexia over the course of a highly effective intervention program to: (a) determine how brain structure and function change in response to reading instruction; and (b) investigate neurobiological factors that predispose a child to struggle or succeed in the intervention. Thus, this proposal seeks to determine both how education shapes brain development, and how a child’s unique neurobiology predicts educational outcomes. Aim 1) White matter plasticity and learning – White matter was previously considered static infrastructure; it is now known that many cellular properties of the white matter change with learning. Reading interventions provide a powerful tool to study experience-dependent plasticity in the human brain. Based on novel quantitative MRI and diffusion MRI measurements developed by the PI and collaborators, it is now possible to quantify changes in cell density, intra-axonal water and myelination at millimeter resolution. Longitudinal measurements collected before, during, and after the intervention will be used to model the time-course of white matter plasticity associated with improvements in reading skills, and investigate the biological mechanisms that underlie differences in learning among children. Aim 2) Bottom-up and top-down computations in the reading circuit - When our eyes fixate upon a word, a cascade of neural processes is initiated, beginning in the visual system and progressing through a series of computations that translate the visual representation into sound and meaning. We have developed the first model of the neural computations performed by critical components of the brain’s reading circuitry. Based on this new understanding of computations in the literate adult brain, we will investigate how computations differ in children with dyslexia, and change in response to reading instruction. Aim 3) Neural biomarkers of learning outcomes - Even in a controlled and intensive learning environment, some children show substantial improvements in reading skill, while others show limited change. What biological factors predispose a child to excel or struggle when provided a high-quality intervention? Pre- intervention MRI measurements will be examined as predictor variables for individual differences in intervention learning rate, and long-term, post-intervention outcomes. Aim 3 will capitalize machine learning to develop a model of the neuroanatomical factors that predict learning outcomes. Dyslexia, an impairment in accurate or fluent word recognition, is the most common learning disability affecting roughly ten percent of children. This proposal capitalizes on cutting edge neuroimaging methods, in combination with carefully controlled educational interventions and behavioral measurements, to generate a new understanding of how successful intervention shapes the development of the brain circuits that support skilled reading. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms of successful remediation of dyslexia, and individual differences in learning, will pave the way for personalized approaches to dyslexia treatment.",Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia,9815781,R01HD095861,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cell Density', 'Child', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Eye', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Myelin Sheath', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Water', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain remodeling', 'brain shape', 'cognitive task', 'density', 'educational atmosphere', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'intervention program', 'learning outcome', 'literate', 'millimeter', 'mouse model', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'phonology', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'successful intervention', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,535853,-0.008667811309133175
"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining longitudinal multimodal brain imaging and high- dimensional behavioral assessments in school-age children together with sophisticated data analytic techniques to increase precision when linking heterogeneous ECAs and child outcome with the goal of predicting mental health outcomes and identifying children who would benefit most from specific early interventions.  ",Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities,9731666,R01MH091864,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Orphanages', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'caregiving', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'foster care', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'middle childhood', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prepuberty', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'violence exposure']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2019,736672,0.035373138290661195
"Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED) PROJECT SUMMARY In this application, I am requesting support from a career development award to support my research proposal titled “Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction”. I will be undertaking this work with the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Gordon (Primary US mentor) at the Washington University, St Louis and Dr. Asad Ali (Primary LMIC mentor) at the Aga Khan University. This project builds on our existing studies of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The current application aims to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of EED by studying the evolution of gut microbial configuration in children who have clinical and histological evidence of EED. EED is common in children living in impoverished conditions with limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Histopathological changes of EED in small bowel mucosa include alteration in crypt to villous ratio along with lymphocytic infiltration of the villous epithelium and lamina propria. Although studies involving biopsies of small bowel mucosa are critical to study EED, these studies are uncommon because of logistic challenges involving performing endoscopies in field settings in LMICs. We have previously demonstrated in an ongoing BMGF funded study that we are able to safely obtain such biopsies, we now have a unique opportunity to study the relationship between gut microbiome evolution and EED in this cohort. The central hypothesis of the current application is that children with histological confirmation of EED have shared features of a bacterial community which is different from healthy controls and non-EED subjects, and that such changes in bacterial configuration are associated with enteric and systemic inflammation. For testing these hypotheses, evaluation of gut microbiome in healthy and stunted children will be carried out to identify the age discriminatory bacterial taxa in children with and without confirmation of EED. Dr. Gordon will be providing mentorship and experience in gut microbiome and microbiota analysis. Dr. Ali will provide the needed infrastructure of the field site and laboratory facilities, along with linking the microbiome analysis with clinical and histological outcomes of interest. The Aga Khan University is a leading regional research institute with multiple support systems for junior investigators which will be vital for my career transition as an independent scientist. My long term goal is to be the principal investigator of my own laboratory, focusing on studying the gut microbiome and its relationship with communicable and non-communicable diseases. I envision working on microbiota derived therapy for EED, and to find targets in the inflammatory pathways driven by changes in gut homeostasis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Globally, Pakistan has the third highest rate of stunting among children aged < 5 years. Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) is proposed to be a critical factor responsible for chronic growth faltering in children in resource limited settings. This research utilizes an innovative approach to study a program of postnatal gut microbiome development in children and its impact on child growth. This proposal will provide an ideal training platform for a translational scientist, covering the domains of mucosal immunology, histopathology, computational analysis, microbiome analysis and host immune responses. The skills learnt from this project will be critical for the capacity development of both the LMIC institution and the candidate herself.","Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED)",9712985,K43TW010697,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Duodenum', 'Endoscopy', 'Enteral', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Gut Mucosa', 'Height', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Homeostasis', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lamina Propria', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Small Intestines', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Sustainable Development', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Villous', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'drinking water', 'enteric pathogen', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'fecal microbiota', 'global health', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'host microbiome', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intestinal villi', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiota', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'skills', 'translational scientist']",FIC,AGA KHAN UNIVERSITY (PAKISTAN),K43,2019,64933,0.026634725756415935
"Secondary use of EMR for residency training in asthma care and documentation PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma is the most common chronic illness among children. In our preliminary study, we discovered significant variations in the volume and quality of clinical documentation on asthma in electronic medical records (EMRs) between pediatric residents and pediatric faculty. For example, although pediatric residents documented much more extensively than the pediatric faculty on asthma-related histories consistent with a diagnosis of asthma, the residents were less likely to make an actual diagnosis of asthma than their faculty counterparts. This variation in documenting asthma-related events in EMRs has two important implications: one is a proficiency issue related to the training of pediatric residents in achieving clinical competence in asthma care and documentation; the other is a data quality issue, which impacts the secondary use of EMR for downstream analyses. At present, little has been reported on the secondary use of EMR for residency training. The primary goal of this proposed study is to develop an informatics tool assessing residents' adherence to asthma guidelines (i.e., competence in asthma care) and documentation variation (i.e., competence in documentation) (Aim 1) and evaluate individual pediatric resident's competence in asthma care and documentation by conducting a population-based birth cohort study (Aim 2). The tool can be utilized to provide “individualized clinical effectiveness data” for residents enhancing their clinical competence in asthma care, as recommended by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). In Aim 1: We will develop an automated informatics tool assessing adherence to asthma guidelines and documentation variation in primary care settings. We will extract the necessary clinical elements from both structured data querying from our database and unstructured data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to assess adherence to guidelines and documentation variation. The performance of element extraction will be assessed against manual chart reviews as gold standard. In Aim 2: We will evaluate clinical competence of pediatric residents in asthma care and asthma diagnosis. We will assess clinical competence in asthma care for children with persistent asthma and examine clinical competence in asthma diagnosis from clinical documentation using the informatics tool developed in Aim 1. Expected outcomes: The proposed research is significant, innovative, and exploratory as little is known about the secondary use of EMR for residency training. If successful, the study results will: a) deliver individualized clinical effectiveness data report to pediatric residents to enhance their clinical training and documentation; and b) provide an informatics tool assessing adherence to asthma care guidelines in clinical practice settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma is the most common chronic illness among children that is frequently evaluated and managed by pediatric residents. No training tools are available that provide individualized feedback on residents' competence in asthma care and documentation from their clinical notes. We address this challenge by developing an automated tool to provide data-driven feedback to individual residents to enhance their competence in asthma care and documentation.",Secondary use of EMR for residency training in asthma care and documentation,9663484,R21AI142702,"['Accreditation', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Competence', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Competence', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'graduate medical education', 'individualized feedback', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'population based', 'practice setting', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'tool']",NIAID,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2019,238500,0.10097217526729012
"Multifactorial spatiotemporal analyses to evaluate environmental triggers and patient-level clinical characteristics of severe asthma exacerbations in children Asthma is a chronic heterogeneous airway disorder characterized by inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, airway hyperreactivity, and impaired airflow. Severe exacerbations of asthma occur frequently in children and require immediate use of systemic steroid therapy to prevent serious outcomes such as hospitalization or death. In addition to direct health risks, pediatric asthma exerts a substantial cost burden, as asthma exacerbations are a leading cause of emergency department visits, hospitalization, and missed school days. Multiple environmental factors are purported to play a role in asthma symptoms, including aeroallergens, pollutants, weather changes, and community viral outbreaks such as influenza. Additionally, asthma prevalence is greater in children of low socioeconomic status (SES) and in African-American and Hispanic/Latino children, suggesting both environmental and genetic effects on asthma incidence and severity. The existence of geographical asthma “hotspots” indicates that asthma prevalence and severity are influenced by place-based risks, including local air quality, built environment factors, access to health care providers, socioeconomic factors, culture, and behavior. To effectively prevent and treat pediatric asthma attacks, it is necessary to understand how patient-specific characteristics interact with environmental factors to render an individual susceptible to severe asthma exacerbations. Lacking sufficient power, previous studies have largely examined suspected asthma triggers in isolation; thus, there is a significant knowledge gap regarding how environmental factors interact with each other and with patient-level factors to promote severe asthma exacerbations in pediatric populations. We hypothesize that a longitudinal analysis of environmental exposures and patient-level factors will elucidate new multifactorial causes of severe asthma exacerbations. To elucidate the contributions and interactions of environmental and patient-level factors, we will apply machine learning approaches to a longitudinal (2007-2017) geocoded database of patient electronic health records detailing asthma-related health encounters and publicly available, overlapping spatiotemporal environmental data. Further, we will evaluate the interactions between person-level clinical factors, including obesity, history of premature birth/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and atopy, to determine their effects on susceptibility to selected environmental triggers. These analyses will 1) provide an analysis of the relative contribution and interactions of environmental factors to pediatric asthma exacerbations, 2) identify geographic hotspots of asthma prevalence and severity, and 3) determine how person-level clinical factors influence susceptibility to different asthma triggers. Our findings will provide new insights into risk factors for severe asthma exacerbations, spur new studies into the biological mechanisms that underlie the interactions between human biology and the environment, inform preventive strategies and patient education efforts, and serve as a model that can be expanded to larger cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma affects 1 in 10 children in the United States, and severe asthma exacerbations require immediate medical attention to prevent hospitalization or death. A wide variety of environmental triggers such as pollutants and allergens are associated with asthma symptoms, but the interaction between different environmental triggers and person-level characteristics such as obesity, allergy, and history of premature birth are unclear. These studies will use longitudinal, overlapping asthma patient and environmental data to understand the role of different environmental triggers in asthma exacerbations in order to develop new preventive and therapeutic strategies for asthma.",Multifactorial spatiotemporal analyses to evaluate environmental triggers and patient-level clinical characteristics of severe asthma exacerbations in children,9654855,R21HL145415,"['Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Air', 'Allergens', 'Asthma', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Fibrinogen', 'Food', 'Genetic', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Hispanics', 'Hormonal', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human Biology', 'Humidity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Influenza', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Latino', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Needs Assessment', 'Neighborhoods', 'North Carolina', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Pollen', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Steroid therapy', 'Symptoms', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Visit', 'Weather', 'airborne allergen', 'airway hyperresponsiveness', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'atopy', 'base', 'built environment', 'cohort', 'cost', 'demographics', 'deprivation', 'electronic data', 'health care availability', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'low socioeconomic status', 'medical attention', 'mucus hypersecretion', 'novel', 'pediatric emergency', 'pollutant', 'prevent', 'respiratory virus', 'response', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'urgent care', 'violent crime']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,120500,0.11160516510593747
"Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility. Project abstract Asthma and obesity are two of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and are increasing in prevalence in the US and worldwide. Obesity and asthma are linked: as body mass index increases, the risk of asthma also increases. Asthma is not a single disease, but a group of overlapping phenotypes caused by multiple distinct molecular mechanisms, many of which remain undefined. Obese asthmatics have a severe phenotype of asthma that is poorly responsive to standard medication regimens and often characterized by more severe exacerbations, most of which are due to viral infections. However, the underlying immunometabolic mechanism leading to immune dysfunction in obese asthma remains unclear. To address this and establish testable hypotheses, I conducted a pilot study of pediatric asthmatics (A), obese asthmatics (OA), obese (O) and healthy control (HC) patients using multiple high dimensional assays, including mass cytometry, metabolomics and serum cytokine measurements. This study showed that obese asthmatics have two forms of immune dysregulation that may impair anti-viral responses: increased type 2 immunity and CD8 T cell exhaustion. In addition, OA patients have alterations in serum metabolites, including increased levels of glutamate, which may underlie some of these alterations in T cell state. Here, I intend to tackle the fundamental and tractable question of the nature of immune dysregulation in obese asthma by testing hypotheses derived from my human data using relevant mouse models of disease. First, I will test whether elevated levels of serum glutamate, a serum metabolite increased in OA patients, directly increases type 2 immunity (Aim 1). Second, I will confirm the presence of increased CD8 T cell exhaustion in a mouse model of OA and assess the impact of T cell exhaustion on influenza infection by measuring the impact of abrogating a core exhaustion pathway, the PD-1 pathway (Aim 2). Both aims will utilize novel techniques, including mass cytometry and immunometabolic studies. I will receive training in bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to systems immunology, including machine learning, that will allow me to gain insight into these comprehensive, multifaceted datasets to establish the core pathways and targets that should be pursued as therapeutic targets in these complex patients. My proposal outlines a 5-year training program for my development as a physician-scientist in Pediatric Allergy Immunology. In particular, I will focus on gaining additional expertise in cutting-edge mass cytometry and systems immunology data analysis techniques, as well as mouse models of asthma and obesity. This will allow me to integrate complex human and mouse datasets, generating and testing mechanistic hypotheses with direct clinical applicability. I believe my training plan, within the remarkable environments in Dr. Wherry’s lab, CHOP and UPenn, will position me to become an independently funded physician scientist. Project Narrative Pediatric obese asthma is a severe disease that responds poorly to standard asthma medications and has higher rates of more severe viral asthma flares. Here, I have used a combination of advanced experimental methods and cutting-edge data analysis tools to uncover possible causes of immune system dysfunction in obese asthma that may play important roles in their poor anti-viral responses. Based on my data from patients, I will use mouse models of obese asthma to test whether changes in serum metabolites or immune exhaustion are important causes of the immune dysfunction observed in pediatric obese asthma.",Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility.,9665877,K08AI135091,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Allergens', 'Anti-Asthmatic Agents', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Antiviral Response', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Caring', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Flare', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Interleukin-13', 'Knockout Mice', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Obese Mice', 'Obesity', 'PD-1 pathway', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Activation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'T cell differentiation', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Th2 Cells', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Weights and Measures', 'Work', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'antiviral immunity', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthma model', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'atopy', 'base', 'career', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cytokine', 'dimensional analysis', 'drinking water', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pediatric patients', 'respiratory infection virus', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'translational approach']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K08,2019,186948,0.0733879572350772
"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,9606448,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,342009,-0.029573390187382777
"Identification and characterization of children with asthma-associated comorbidities through computational and immune phenotyping PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma, the most common chronic disease among children, is one of the five most burdensome diseases in the US. While current care and research efforts focus on symptom control and exacerbation risk, children with asthma may suffer from infectious and inflammatory diseases, ie, asthma-associated infectious and inflammatory disease comorbidities (AIICs) (eg, pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster, appendicitis, and celiac disease). Although AIICs pose serious threats to children with asthma, they are largely under-recognized, as evidenced by diabetes mellitus being widely recognized but a less common chronic illness with a magnitude similar to that for asthma. Presently, the mechanisms underlying AIICs are unknown. We postulate immunosenescence might be related, as AIICs coincide with cardinal immunosenescence features. AIICs are not clinically defined and a suitable tool has not been developed to identify children with AIICs. Thus, no strategies mitigating AIICs risks and outcomes exist. Addressing these knowledge gaps depends upon two key questions: (1) “How can asthmatic children subgroups with increased AIICs risk be identified at a population level using electronic medical records?” and (2) “What immune parameters characterize such children?” Answering these is this proposal's primary goal. To this end, our current R01 study successfully developed, validated, and implemented natural language processing (NLP)- empowered computational phenotyping algorithms for two existing criteria for childhood asthma (Predetermined Asthma Criteria, PAC and Asthma Predictive Index, API). NLP-empowered algorithm application to the 1997-2007 Olmsted County Birth Cohort (OCBC) enabled us to profile a subgroup of children with asthma at increased AIICs risk, disproportionately represented by children who met both NLP-PAC and NLP-API. Our new pilot data suggest asthma potentially accelerates immunosenescence leading to AIICs in a subgroup of asthmatic children. In this renewal proposal, we target this subgroup who meet both NLP-PAC and NLP-API. We will develop and apply NLP-empowered computational phenotyping algorithms for AIICs to identify such children at a population level, then characterize their immune parameters measuring immunosenescence. In Aim 1, we will develop new NLP-empowered computational phenotyping algorithms for recognized and unrecognized AIICs (NLP-AIIC) for children enrolled in Mayo Clinic `s 1997-2016 OCBC, then assess portability of NLP-AIIC at Sanford Children's Hospital, Sioux Falls, SD . In Aim 2, we will identify and characterize children with AIICs through new NLP-AIIC and NLP algorithms for asthma status, by utilizing clinical and immune parameters to measure immunosenescence. In Aim 3, we will assess changes (eg, waning adaptive immunity) over time in immune parameters measuring immunosenescence for 300 children in our R01 study, re-enrolling them for further characterization. This proposed study is indispensable to understanding why some children with asthma develop AIICs, while others do not. This knowledge will allow us to identify, manage, mitigate, and improve outcomes for AIICs among children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although asthma is the most common chronic disease among children in the United States, its impact on the risk of serious infections and inflammatory diseases is under-recognized. Presently, it is unknown 1) how to use electronic medical records to identify asthmatic children at increased risks of asthma-associated infectious and inflammatory disease comorbidities (AIICs) and 2) which immune parameters characterize such children. Addressing these two questions is this proposal's primary goal since this knowledge will help us strategize early identification of asthmatic children susceptible to AIICs, eventually mitigate risk of AIICs in children with asthma, and improve patient outcomes.",Identification and characterization of children with asthma-associated comorbidities through computational and immune phenotyping,9659471,R01HL126667,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Appendicitis', 'Asthma', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Birth', 'CD3 Antigens', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Celiac Disease', 'Cell Cycle', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Family history of', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Natural Immunity', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Pneumococcal Pneumonia', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sioux Falls', 'Site', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'United States', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'empowered', 'immunosenescence', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'meetings', 'portability', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'senescence', 'study population', 'tool']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,808123,0.1066384440513153
"Automated point-of-care identification of innocent Still's murmur in children PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of the proposed research and technology transfer effort is to develop a low-cost, point-of-care, mobile device-based technology for automated identification of Still's murmur, the most common innocent (benign and harmless) heart murmur of childhood. This novel technology could reduce the current rate of over half a million children unnecessarily referred to pediatric cardiologists by primary care providers each year in the United States. In Phase I, AusculTech Dx and Children's National Medical Center developed a machine-learning algorithm capable of identifying Still's murmur with high accuracy (90% sensitivity, 99% specificity). To enable digital recording, essential for computerized murmur analysis, we also developed a digital stethoscope that connects to a smartphone and is equivalent in performance to a commercial stethoscope. Our envisioned product, called StethAid, is a combination of this novel digital stethoscope and a smartphone application (app). Having successfully met the Phase I performance milestones, we now propose to fully develop StethAid and conduct a multicenter trial through the following three specific aims: (1) develop and test a clinical-grade digital stethoscope, (2) develop fully feature software app, (3) conduct a multicenter trial of automated Still's murmur identification. For the multicenter trial, we have expanded our collaboration to include Boston Children's Hospital and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Our deliverable for Phase II is a technology platform validated by leading pediatric cardiologists that is ready for seeking regulatory approvals, deployment at PCP offices, and commercialization. As a decision support system, StethAid could empower PCPs to identify Still's murmur accurately and thus reduce the huge number of unnecessary specialist referrals. This should save the healthcare system hundreds of millions of dollars annually, allow pediatric cardiologists to focus on patients with serious conditions, and protect healthy children and their families from the unnecessary anxiety, inconvenience, and expense of seeing a pediatric cardiologist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over half a million children are referred unnecessarily to pediatric cardiologists by general physicians for the evaluation of Still's murmur, a normal and harmless heart murmur. This project will develop and clinically validate a novel mobile technology for automated recognition of this murmur in order to reduce the current rate of such unnecessary referrals and associated costs and inconvenience.",Automated point-of-care identification of innocent Still's murmur in children,9680749,R42HL131081,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Apple', 'Benign', 'Bluetooth', 'Boston', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart murmur', 'Incidence', 'Legal patent', 'Libraries', 'Medical center', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'pediatric cardiologist', 'performance tests', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'smartphone Application', 'sound', 'tool', 'wasting', 'web interface']",NHLBI,"AUSCULTECH DX, LLC",R42,2019,764643,0.04604517844596768
"Early understanding of multi-digit numbers Place value concepts and multi-digit numbers are the foundations of mathematics; however, many  children struggle at acquiring this knowledge. Poor understanding of the place value concepts has  been linked to difficulties in mathematics learning through the elementary and middle school  grades, and it is present not only for children with learning disabilities but also for a large  proportion of normally developing children. It is, thus, important to understand the developmental  mechanisms of multi-digit number learning and potential sources of early experiences that allow  some children to readily grasp the concepts while others continue to struggle. Recent research on place value concepts has suggested that children have partial knowledge of  multi-digit numbers at the preschool period, before receiving formal training from schools. These  precursors of multi-digit number knowledge can serve as important stepping-stones for children to  master the concept of place value once entering schools. However, there are at least two gaps in  our current understanding of the development  of place value concepts. First, how does early  understanding of multi-digit numbers relate to formal school training of the place value concepts?  Second, how do children come to acquire partial knowledge of multi-digit numbers at such a young  age in the first place? The goal of the proposed research aims at filling these gaps in the  literature with three specific aims. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that early knowledge of multi-digit  numbers is predictive of later school learning of the place value concepts. I propose to conduct a  3-year longitudinal study to measure children’s early understanding of multi-digit numbers at the  start and end of kindergarten, 1st  and 2nd grades. The study will test how early knowledge of  number names and written numerals, as well as other individual difference measurements (e.g., age,  gender, SES, number sense, home exposures to numbers),  relate to the learning of base-10  principles in grade school. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that acquiring early knowledge of  multi-digit numbers is a form of statistical learning, during which children extract latent  structures that govern the mapping between number words and written numerals through sparse  co-occurrence data. A training study is designed to give children casual experiences with  multi-digit numbers in engaging and child- friendly activities (e.g., picture-book reading, ipad  games). The same children in the statistical learning training will also be given formal school  training afterward, allowing us to assess and provide causal evidence for the hypothesis that early  knowledge prepares children for formal school training of the place value concepts. The knowledge  gained from this research will have implications for: a) determining the role of early knowledge of  multi-digit numbers in preparing children to learn about base-10 notation at schools; b) linking  statistical learning from sparse co-occurrence data about number words and multi-digit numbers to  early partial knowledge of place value; c) documenting how differences in early learning  environment (or input) may contribute to developmental inequalities in later school performances. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims at understanding the early development of multi-digit numbers, its learning mechanisms and its impact on formal school training of place value concepts. The period of development studied here, from 3 to 5 years of age, is a period during which sizable individual differences in multi-digit number knowledge starts to emerge, which may contribute to early developmental inequalities that limit the development of some children even after entering school. The proposed work is relevant to public health in that it will shed light on how differences in early learning environment lead to individual differences in early understanding of multi-digit numbers, potentially serving as the foundation for future early mathematical training programs.",Early understanding of multi-digit numbers,9567447,F32HD090827,"['5 year old', '6 year old', 'Age', 'Books', 'Child', 'Consequentialism', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Digit structure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inequality', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Names', 'Nursery Schools', 'Only Child', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preschool Child', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'early experience', 'educational atmosphere', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first grade', 'formal learning', 'grasp', 'junior high school', 'kindergarten', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematics disability', 'second grade', 'socioeconomics', 'success']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F32,2019,59038,-0.009172398553991113
"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5  percent of school-­aged children in the US. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of children with FASD and their  families can access FASD-­informed interventions due to significant systems-­ and family-­level barriers.  Research suggests that self-­directed and peer-­to-­peer interventions are acceptable to families and can lead to  significant improvements in parenting, child behavior, and resource utilization. Advancements in technology  are facilitating more accessible and interactive methods for self-­directed education and support. The proposed  project will develop and evaluate the efficacy of a novel mobile health (mHealth) application (“app”) to directly  provide caregivers with evidence-­based content and peer-­moderated support they can easily access and use  to improve outcomes for their children and families. The app, currently called “FMF Connect,” will be derived  from the scientifically-­validated Families Moving Forward (FMF) Program and will build on existing frameworks  for the development of medical apps. This project will follow a systematic approach to the development and  evaluation of the FMF Connect mHealth intervention, including a small-­scale feasibility trial (n=30), and a  larger-­scale hybrid implementation-­effectiveness trial (n=120) with caregivers raising children (ages 3-­12) with  FASD. Implementation data will aid in identifying the patterns of app usage that relate to the greatest  improvements in child and caregiver outcomes. Study hypotheses are: 1) that caregivers will find the FMF  Connect intervention acceptable, with easy to access content and encouraging support from peer-­moderators;;  2) that greater usage of specific intervention components will relate to larger improvements in child and  caregiver outcomes;; 3) that caregivers who receive the FMF Connect intervention will have larger gains on  child and caregiver outcomes relative to a waitlist comparison group;; and 4) that an increase in  neurodevelopmental attributions for behavior will mediate intervention-­related improvements in parenting  efficacy and child behavior. Project findings will guide further app development both in terms of content and  technological advances to optimize intervention effects. Results of this study will further the overall strategic  aims of the Collaborative Initiative on FASD (CIFASD), which are to inform and develop effective interventions  for FASD. This project will also benefit from resources and collaborations within CIFASD to carry out the  proposed work, including recruitment of a diverse sample, diagnostic support, and outreach and dissemination.  This is one of the first studies to empirically test an mHealth intervention delivered by parents with peer-­

"Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use across different clinical centers; (2) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post- surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a multi-center study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 focus on relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology, developed at Texas Children's Hospital, which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor,9728036,R01HL142994,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Ventricle', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'news', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,573724,0.054204317510767465
"Technology and Parent-Child Interaction PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Radesky is a board-certified Developmental Behavioral Pediatrician whose prior research and clinical work has focused on the importance of early childhood experiences in shaping long-term developmental and behavioral outcomes, particularly in low-income children. Her research has examined how digital media – including television and mobile devices such as smartphones – interacts with the early-parent child relationship, both being shaped by, and shaping, parenting behaviors and child social-emotional development. This mentored career development award will allow her to learn additional methodologies for assessing parent- child interaction and mobile device usage by parents. She has identified a comprehensive, trans-disciplinary mentoring team at the University of Michigan Departments of Pediatrics, Health Behavior and Health Education, Psychiatry, Psychology, Communications, and Informatics, as well as the Center for Human Growth and Development, to provide methodological and content expertise, including: Julie Lumeng, MD; Alison Miller, PhD; Katherine Rosenblum, PhD; Scott W. Campbell, PhD; and Mark Newman, PhD. This team of mentors and advisors will help guide her towards the following Training and Career Goals: 1. Develop working knowledge of theoretical models of parent-child interaction 2. Develop skills in using mobile devices to collect usage data and ecologic momentary assessment of parent  emotional states 3. Develop skills in research methods to assess parent-child interaction, including:  a) Behavioral coding of parent-child interaction from videotape  b) Language Environment Analysis (LENA) audiorecording to measure parent-child verbal interaction 4. Learn statistical analytic techniques unique to assessing parent-child interaction 5. Develop familiarity with the field of information science/human-computer interaction to inform future studies. Healthy social-emotional development in young children relies on sensitive, responsive parent-child interactions, particularly in children growing up in adversity. Screen media use is a highly prevalent behavior that may be a modifiable barrier to responsive parent-child interactions. Despite rapid increases in the use of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) by families with young children, there is a paucity of research examining associations between mobile device use and parent-child interactions. This research plan focuses on testing a conceptual model that parent and child traits predict how parents use mobile devices during family activities, and that certain features of this device use (particularly their emotional response to it) predict changes in parent-child interaction. This model also examines temporal contingencies in parent-child interaction and mobile device use, in order to help clarify directionality. This conceptual model will be tested through 3 Specific Aims: Aim 1) Test the hypotheses that parent depressive symptoms, lower parenting self-efficacy, higher parenting stress, and child difficult temperament and lower child emotion regulation are associated with higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use. Aim 2) Test the hypotheses that higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use are associated with less parent-child verbal exchange, lower parental responsivity, more parent-child conflict, and lower parent ability to read child behavioral cues. Aim 3) Determine whether changes in parent-child interaction (changes in parent and child affect, verbal exchange, parent responsivity, parent-child conflict, or parent ability to read child behavioral cues) occur before or after parent mobile device use. These Specific Aims will be carried out in two complementary cohorts: A) 296 low-income mother-child dyads enrolled in an existing cohort study with previously collected videotapes of home mealtimes, during which mobile devices are commonly used; and B) 100 parent-child dyads from a range of socioeconomic status backgrounds who will be followed for 4 days of data collection with continuous mobile device-based passive sensing of the parent's mobile device use, coordinated with simultaneous audiorecording of parent-child interaction using Language Environment Analysis (LENA) technology. Future Implications: The results from this work will contribute to an evidence base about how families can use the explosion of new media in their households in the healthiest ways possible, both through the formation of clinical guidelines and future interventional approaches. PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Despite the rapidly increasing ownership and use of mobile technology by parents and evidence showing that older technologies such as television displace important parent-child interactions, remarkably little research has examined the effects of mobile device use on families. This proposal examines which parent-child dyads are at highest risk of disturbances in parent-child interaction from mobile devices, how parent mobile device use precedes or follows changes in parent-child interactions, and the behavioral mechanisms underlying these associations. We anticipate that our findings will be applied to clinical guidelines for mobile device use by families, interventions to help improve parent-child engagement in the highest risk families, and the development of technologies that might be better designed to not intrude upon family time.",Technology and Parent-Child Interaction,9702069,K23HD092626,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Attention', 'Audiotape', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Caregivers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communication', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Familiarity', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Hearing', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Sciences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Observational Study', 'Ownership', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Provider', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'career', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'digital media', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'irritation', 'mobile computing', 'pediatric department', 'pediatrician', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'skills', 'social', 'technology development', 'theories', 'trait']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2019,167319,0.01761997841373465
"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9699521,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', '3-Dimensional', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'ROC Curve', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'Treatment outcome', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiometabolism', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,743544,0.025287160055924133
"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate. In this application, we propose to develop and assess the validity of an in-home objective, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system, called FLASH that has the potential to revolutionize the measurement of screen use behaviors.",Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH,9693725,R01DK113269,"['10 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'Asses', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral outcome', 'college', 'computational platform', 'cost', 'diaries', 'field study', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity development', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'preservation', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'tv watching', 'validation studies']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,515083,-0.018679757357099928
"Images of Children and Adults for Health Research Abstract: This project's goal of expanding the extant archive for a major longitudinal study to include an innovative collection of images of children and adults is well-aligned with the initiative (PAR-16-149) to support the archiving of NICHD-funded data sets for secondary data analyses. The longitudinal study was funded through a U01 partnership with NICHD, and the images that will be added to its archive can take longitudinal and intergenerational health research in significantly new directions. As background, the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD) was a major investment of NICHD in a longitudinal study of children and parents. The observational, survey, medical, biological, and video data from the NICHD- sponsored data collection over 15 years are archived at the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), with data collection on the now-adult sample ongoing. A current R01 project by the PIs of this proposal has developed a systematic process for extracting and rating “short slice” images of children and parents from videos. This system has resulted in short slices of children at 11 time points, short slices of mothers at four time points, and ratings of the attractiveness of their faces and bodies at all these time points. The child ratings—along with a detailed codebook—are already being added to the SECCYD archive through the current R01 so that health scholars licensed with ICPSR can merge them with the SECCYD for analyses of child and adolescent development. The proposed R03 would allow a substantial and valuable expansion by also archiving the actual short slices of children, extracting short slices of mothers at the remaining time points, extracting the short slices of fathers at the five time points they were videotaped, and adding all of these short slices to the archive along with expanded codebooks. The PIs are partnering with ICPSR to open up their secure system for housing and organizing these images so that other researchers could use them for their own purposes and not have to travel to the ICSPR data enclave. Such an enterprise would exploit the original R01 project to realize substantial economies of scale in creating a resource for health research to inform a wide array of health and health-relevant literatures. Indeed, a substantial body of research has documented the valid and reliable ways that images of the face and body can be used. For example, scholars could access this expanded SECCYD archive to examine the development of health conditions (e.g., obesity), the corrosive effects of disadvantage on health (e.g., the physical toll of poverty), the link between social stigmas and health (e.g., colorism and depression), family health dynamics (e.g., disjunctures in health of parents and children), and other important questions concerning individual and population health. They can also go beyond human rating to exploit new machine scoring techniques that enable measurements beyond the human eye that provide insights into biological processes (e.g., hormone levels, sexual dimorphism). The codebooks will also provide a template for other scholars to expand their own NIH-funded data collections or to launch new ones. Project Narrative In response to a NICHD funding opportunity on archiving datasets, this project will significantly contribute to a number of fields of health research by archiving an expansive longitudinal set of images of the faces and bodies of children and their parents over a 15 year period. With a secure system to facilitate ease of access and use, such images can be human rated (e.g., perceived age, weight, skin color) and machine scored (e.g., biologically informative facial measurements) to measure continuity and change in physical development and health and to capture the physical toll of the environment on individual wellbeing. Extending a prior NICHD- funded project that rated 11 waves of videos from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development to longitudinally study children's appearance, this larger archive of images will provide a valuable resource for researchers aiming to conduct innovative research on health and health disparities.",Images of Children and Adults for Health Research,9745971,R03HD096203,"['Academic achievement', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Appearance', 'Archives', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Birds', 'Birth', 'Catalogs', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Corrosives', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline', 'Documentation', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Family health status', 'Fathers', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Guidelines', 'Half-Life', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health Status', 'Hormones', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investments', 'Licensing', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nose', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Social Environment', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'base', 'data archive', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'image archival system', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'middle age', 'population health', 'recruit', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sexual dimorphism', 'skin color', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social implication', 'social stigma', 'transmission process']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2019,78706,0.013765463400399362
"Inflammation Phenotypes in Pediatric Sepsis Induced Multiple Organ Failure Renewal Carcillo R01 Project Abstract Every year over 1 million American adults and children develop overwhelming infection leading to a rotting of their body we call ‘sepsis’, and death in up to 1 of 3 afflicted (www.nigms.nih.gov>NIGMS Home>Science Education). National efforts emphasizing early recognition, intravenous fluids to help organs, and antibiotics to kill infection, have reduced mortality so that now 1 of 4 die. We and others have asked the question “why do patients continue to die despite these national efforts?’ In the previous funding period we showed in 401 children with sepsis that those who developed organ shut down despite these efforts, did so because they were a) unable to fight germs causing unending infection, b) unable to stop clotting off their body causing kidney failure, and/or c) unable to kill viruses causing liver failure; all of which led to death from uncontrolled inflammation with clotting, bleeding and liver failure. Fortunately, each of these organ shutdown groups has hopeful treatments. With the new information we collected in the previous funding period we have already designed and started clinical trials testing these treatments including immune boosters for children unable to kill germs, plasma removal and replacement using plasma exchange for children unable to stop clotting, monoclonal antibodies to kill viruses and their homes to reverse liver failure in children unable to do so on their own, and anti-inflammatory proteins to reverse uncontrollable inflammation, in hopes of helping save many of the 1 of 4 children still dying from sepsis related organ shutdown. In this next funding period, we propose to use the clinical information and samples already obtained in our previous study to take advantage of the wonderful advances made this millenia in computer technology, big data, bioinformatics, and the study of human and virus genetics to perform Specific Aim 1) use a ‘Watson’ like approach to ask the computer to help us figure out if the children with sepsis have any other causes of organ shutdown that we can help, Specific Aim 2) use an ‘Ancestry.com’-like or ‘23 and me’-like approach to identify ‘precision medicine’ therapies for causes of organ shutdown that we can treat on a patient by patient basis, and Specific Aim 3) use a bedside molecular biology test approach to identify individualized therapies to kill DNA viruses and reduce cytokine inflammation. We think that DNA viruses are the unappreciated co-infection which causes uncontrolled cytokine inflammation and leads to organ shutdown. Our long term objective is to plan ‘precision’ medicine and ‘individualized’ medicine clinical trials testing therapies on an individual patient basis in order to further reduce death from sepsis organ shutdown in children. Carcillo R01 Narrative Statement Every year over 1 million American adults and children develop overwhelming infection leading to a rotting of their body we call ‘sepsis’, and death in up to 1 of 4 afflicted (www.nigms.nih.gov>NIGMS Home>Science Education). In our previous funding period we showed that this occurs when groups of patients are unable to kill germs, stop clotting or bleeding, or stop viruses from reproducing, and we have therefore designed and begun clinical trials to help these children do so. In this new funding period we are using ‘Watson’-like, ‘Twenty three and me’-like, and ‘Ancestry.com’-like approaches to figure out how to help each child with individually tailored treatments that are best at helping them live long and happy lives.",Inflammation Phenotypes in Pediatric Sepsis Induced Multiple Organ Failure Renewal,9883359,R01GM108618,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adenoviruses', 'Adult', 'American', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibiotics', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Coagulation Process', 'Complement', 'Computers', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'DNA', 'DNA Viruses', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Excision', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Germ', 'Hemorrhage', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Home environment', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Human Herpesvirus 6', 'IV Fluid', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Interleukin-1', 'Interleukin-18', 'Interleukin-6', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Liver Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Macrophage activation syndrome', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Natural Immunity', 'Organ', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Units', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Exchange', 'Precision medicine trial', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Viremia', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'exome', 'fighting', 'gene interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'recruit', 'science education', 'septic patients', 'targeted treatment', 'trial design', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,537434,0.04982520752120212
"A bench to population epidemiologic approach to investigating the effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child gut inflammation, growth, and development PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Lin is a research scientist at the University of California, Berkeley in Professor John (Jack) Colford's group. She completed her PhD in Microbiology and Immunology at Stanford University in 2012. Since 2010, she has worked as the coordinating microbiologist for the WASH Benefits study, a large-scale, multi- country cluster randomized trial evaluating the impact of water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutritional interventions on child health, with a focus on gut inflammation. This research and training plan builds on her strong interdisciplinary background at the nexus of microbiology, immunology, and global health. Gaining experience in epidemiology and biostatistics will facilitate her transition to a `bench to population' independent investigator at UC Berkeley and will ultimately enable her to achieve her long-term career goal to become a global health leader in the evaluation of antenatal and early life interventions to improve child health. Environment: UC Berkeley has a long history of conducting innovative and groundbreaking research advancing epidemiological and biostatistical theory and application in international health. To achieve her career goal, Dr. Lin seeks training in (1) epidemiology, with a focus on causal inference methods (in particular, marginal structural models for direct and indirect effects and targeted maximum likelihood estimation) (2) biostatistics and (3) child stress and development. To achieve these goals, Dr. Lin has assembled a unique interdisciplinary training and mentoring team based at UC Berkeley. Jack Colford (primary mentor) will guide her training in epidemiological theory and application. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor) will guide her training in biostatistics and causal inference methods including models for direct and indirect effects and targeted maximum likelihood estimation. Lia Fernald (co-mentor) will guide her training in child development and stress. Research Project: Early life linear growth faltering is associated with impaired development, but its underlying pathogenesis is poorly understood. Subclinical intestinal inflammation and damage affects children living in low-income countries and is increasingly recognized as a potential main contributor to the vicious cycle of early life malnutrition and oral vaccine failure. Little is known about the pregnancy risk factors associated with gut inflammation and the impact of these antenatal factors on linear growth and neurodevelopment. In Aim 1, Dr. Lin will determine the association between maternal stress and inflammation during pregnancy and subsequent measures of child gut inflammation and permeability. In Aim 2, she will evaluate the relationship between antenatal stress and inflammation and future child linear growth and development. She proposes to use modern causal inference methods to elucidate the potential pathways from antenatal stress and inflammation to child gut inflammation, linear growth faltering, and poor development. Ultimately, this mentored research will prepare Dr. Lin for a successful R01-level application to investigate potential downstream effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child stress, inflammation, and susceptibility to infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Widely pervasive subclinical inflammation and damage of the small intestine is observed in children living in low-income countries and is increasingly recognized as a potential main contributor to the vicious cycle of early life malnutrition and oral vaccine failure. Little is known about the pregnancy risk factors associated with gut inflammation and permeability and the impact of these antenatal factors on linear growth and neurodevelopment in infants from low-income countries. Understanding these critical pathways will be an important contribution to public health because it will enable the identification of key biological markers to identify prospectively at-risk children, to evaluate the efficacy of interventions, and to suggest potential intervention targets to improve child linear growth and development trajectories; we propose to use modern causal inference methods to elucidate these critical pathways in children living in rural Bangladesh.","A bench to population epidemiologic approach to investigating the effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child gut inflammation, growth, and development",9662744,K01AI136885,"['5 year old', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'C-reactive protein', 'California', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Country', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'F2-Isoprostanes', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hygiene', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Lactulose', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Mannitol', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neopterin', 'Nutritional', 'Observational Study', 'Orosomucoid', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peroxidases', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Small Intestines', 'Stress', 'Structural Models', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Villous Atrophy', 'Water', 'Work', 'absorption', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin', 'antenatal', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'career', 'cytokine', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'global health', 'improved', 'innovation', 'low income country', 'maternal stress', 'neurodevelopment', 'oral vaccine', 'prevent', 'professor', 'prospective', 'repository', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'therapy development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2019,138842,0.026191490210086637
"Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record Project Summary/Abstract Sepsis is a critical illness syndrome characterized by infection leading to life-threatening organ failure. Affecting over 200,000 individuals in the United States each year, sepsis accounts for nearly half of all hospital deaths and over $20 billion in yearly US hospital costs. Despite the development and dissemination of evidence-based guidelines, most patients with sepsis do not consistently receive recommended care, resulting in preventable morbidity and mortality. Consequently, there is increasing interest in implementing health policies designed to incentivize quality improvement at the hospital level. The largest and most prominent of these policies to date is the new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) quality reporting initiative, known as SEP-1. SEP-1 requires hospitals to report their compliance with a variety of evidence-based care processes, including timely antibiotic administration, timely volume resuscitation, and routine monitoring of the clinical response to therapy. SEP-1 is unique among quality measures in the CMS Inpatient Quality Reporting Program, both because it is the only measure based on a critical illness syndrome and because it is of unparalleled complexity, requiring the coordinated efforts of multiple health care providers across the acute care spectrum. As a consequence, it is essential to understand how SEP-1 has affected patient care and clinical outcomes. To address this need, we propose to comprehensively evaluate the impact of the SEP-1 measure using the electronic health record (EHR) of a large multihospital health system. An EHR-based approach will allow us to understand the impact of the policy in exceptional detail, yielding actionable data not only for policy makers seeking to refine SEP-1 but also for health systems seeking to respond to SEP-1 in a way that maximizes the potential benefits. First, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis recognition and documentation using natural language processing of clinical notes. Second, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis care processes using structured data elements such as vital signs, laboratory values, and medication administration. Third, we will evaluate the impact of the program on patient mortality, length of stay, and requirement for organ support. In all aims we will examine both overall effects and hospital-specific effects, providing an understanding of how hospitals and health systems implement quality improvement in the context of a novel reporting mandate. Together, these aims will yield important new insights into how clinicians and hospitals implement new quality reporting programs. At the same time, through a program of structured mentorship, career development, and stakeholder involvement, this project will provide the principal investigator with new skills in the use of the EHR to evaluate health care quality and the impact of system-level health policies, uniquely positioning him to lead future efforts to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate EHR-based performance interventions for critically ill patients. NARRATIVE Sepsis is a life-threatening response to infection and accounts for significant morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs in the United States. In this proposal, we will use data from the electronic health record of a large health system to evaluate the effects of a novel sepsis quality reporting program on sepsis recognition, treatment, and outcomes. Our findings will yield important early information on the quality reporting program’s impact, helping to guide policy makers as they seek to refine the program and yielding novel insights into strategies to improve sepsis quality in US hospitals.",Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record,9731455,K08HS025455,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K08,2019,148308,0.002888315622045058
"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance  Pediatric septic shock, a leading cause of childhood death, is often recognized late, causing preventable morbidity, and improved early diagnostic approaches would improve the timeliness of sepsis diagnosis, accelerate treatment and improve outcomes. This proposal will provide mentored research training to use predictive modeling to improve early diagnosis of pediatric sepsis, and test the delivery of clinical decision support to clinicians through the electronic health record in an implementation trial. This proposal responds to the AHRQ priorities of improving health care quality through use of information systems, improving safety and quality of care by synthesizing and communicating evidence to health care professionals, advances knowledge generation in a learning health system and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs.",Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED),9747879,K08HS025696,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K08,2019,148539,0.03596269304957286
"Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children Project Summary Access to diagnosis of autism and to invaluable early interventional therapy is severely hampered by the imbalance between the number of children needing care and the inadequate number of clinical practitioners who can deliver that care. This numerical imbalance is unlikely to change in the near future, and therefore there is an urgent need and an exciting opportunity to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers of children at risk for or with a diagnosis of autism, and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Using machine learning and large-scale data mining, we have built a mobile system to quantify and track the severity of autism that takes only minutes of a caregiver’s time and that has promise for repeat use at home due to its speed, accuracy and mobility. We have concomitantly developed a machine-learning system for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glass and delivers real time social cues to individuals with autism in that child’s natural environment. Our goal in this research program is to work with our clinical colleagues at Stanford’s Autism Center to test and refine these complementary machine-learning systems for accuracy and optimal use by families and their child with autism from their natural environments. We will then combine the two systems in a multi-month longitudinal trial designed to harness our mobilized machine learning tool to quantitatively measure the efficacy of our Autism Glasses as a therapeutic assistant that functions in real time and within the child’s natural environment. Our proposed experiments with at least 40 subjects at risk for developmental delay promise to demonstrate how to leverage digital health technologies to improve, mobilize and quicken the detection and treatment of autism. The work also will result in a new and unique dataset that validates the ability to bring the social learning process outside of the clinic and into the real world, leading to a faster, more fluid way for children with autism to gain social skills. We also expect our work to show how measurable indicators of behavioral improvement during therapy will facilitate the process of tracking progress on an increasingly more granular scale, and hopefully set the stage for more effective, precise and personalized treatment. Project Narrative There is a growing and striking imbalance between the number of clinical care providers and the number of children at risk for or managing an autism diagnosis, creating an urgent need to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Our research proposal is focused on building two complementary machine learning tools – one for rapid, mobile measurement of the autism phenotype and one for at-home social learning on Google Glasses – that we believe will open the diagnostic bottleneck and provide a valuable form of behavioral therapy that can be used at home and outside of the clinical setting.",Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children,9524706,R21HD091500,"['Address', 'Age', 'Android', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Therapeutics Program', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operating System', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Self-Direction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'handheld equipment', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intervention program', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'prototype', 'social', 'social learning', 'social skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable device']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,235500,-0.03323238632255933
"Using clinical treatment data in a machine learning approach for sepsis detection Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project, we propose to develop novel software, “HindSight”, that will improve InSight, a machine-learning based clinical decision support (CDS) system for sepsis prediction and detection. HindSight will identify clinicians’ sepsis-related decisions in the records of former patients; it will then use these events to supply InSight with labeled examples of sepsis cases, incorporating clinicians’ judgement to demonstrate appropriate and inappropriate alarms. Together with an online training module that accordingly refines InSight’s predictors, this capability will enable InSight to quickly adapt to the idiosyncrasies of a particular clinical deployment, reduce false or irrelevant alarms, and do both without explicit human supervision. Research Question: Can a machine-learning-based, retrospective labeler learn to autonomously label sepsis and sepsis treatments by integrating the total clinical record, thereby providing many high-quality examples and labels for training a sepsis CDS? In concert with an online learning algorithm, can this labeler facilitate online, supervised learning without explicit human intervention? Prior Work: We have developed InSight for application in a number of sepsis prediction settings. Existing InSight classifiers attain an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.88 for sepsis detection, and 0.74 for 4-hour early sepsis prediction. Specific Aims: To identify patients who were evaluated for sepsis, treated for sepsis, or who actually had sepsis using the retrospective clinical patient record and label them accordingly (Aim 1); to use these labels with an online learning algorithm to implement autonomous, supervised learning of alert behavior which reflects clinician judgement (Aim 2). Methods: We will identify evaluated, treated, and septic patients using a machine learning labeler trained on retrospective data from patients’ electronic health records (EHR) at time of discharge. Using a set of 100 test cases (≥ 20 septic) hand-annotated by our clinician investigators, we will assess the labeler’s performance. Labeling AUROC ≥ 0.95 will constitute success in Aim 1. We will develop an online learning algorithm which enables InSight to continuously retrain during deployment. With Aim 1’s labeler, we will simulate a deployment with online learning, producing a learning curve of predictive AUROC on a held-out test set versus number of observed patients. Aim 2 will be successful if the online training results in superior area under the learning curve versus the initial model and periodic retraining. All experiments will be executed using the MIMIC-III data set. Future Directions: Following the proposed work, the InSight system with an online, HindSight-based retraining module will be deployed at partner hospitals for prospective studies. Narrative Clinical decision support (CDS) systems present critical information to medical professionals by examining patient data and providing alerts. Machine learning is a powerful method for creating CDS tools, but it requires labels which reflect the desired alert behavior. We will develop software that examines discharged patients’ electronic health records (EHR), identifies clinicians’ sepsis treatment decisions and patient outcomes, and passes these labeled examples to an online algorithm for retraining InSight, our machine-learning-based CDS tool for real-time sepsis prediction.",Using clinical treatment data in a machine learning approach for sepsis detection,9557659,R43TR002309,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Drops', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pythons', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'research clinical testing', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'software development', 'success', 'support tools']",NCATS,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,324971,0.008050114669116773
"Pediatric sepsis prediction: a machine learning solution for patient diversity Abstract  Significance:  In  this  SBIR  project,  we  propose  to  predict  and  detect  pediatric  severe  sepsis  by  developing  a  machine-­learning-­based  clinical  decision  support  system  for  electronic  health  record  (EHR)  pediatric  sepsis  screening. The pediatric population is underserved, with fundamental research and understanding of pediatric  sepsis  syndromes  lagging  behind  that  of  the  adult  population.  The  proposed  work  will  develop  machine  learning sepsis predictions on the highly heterogeneous pediatric population, by combining multi-­task learning  methods with expert clinical knowledge of how pediatric sepsis presentation is dependent on age and on pre-­ existing  conditions.  The  multi-­task  learning  approach  will  use  age  or  comorbidities  to  define  “tasks,”  each  one  associated  with  prediction  on  a  particular  subpopulation,  and  then  link  the  learning  process  together  between  tasks. Research Questions: Which methods of using these task-­defining parameters are most effective? How  can  we  most  effectively  learn  the  degree  of  similarity  between  pediatric  subpopulations  and  leverage  this  to  improve classification performance? Prior Work: InSight was originally developed to predict sepsis and septic  shock from adult EHR data. After retraining on pediatric cases, in preliminary experiments with a retrospective  set  of  pediatric  (2-­17  yr)  inpatient  encounters  (n  =  11,127;;  103  [0.9%]  severely  septic),  at  the  University  of  California  San  Francisco  (UCSF),  InSight  achieved  an  AUROC  0.912  and  0.727  for  the  detection  and  4-­hour  pre-­onset  prediction  of  sepsis.  This  performance  can  be  improved  for  better  pediatric  sepsis  prediction.  Specific  Aims:  To  empirically  evaluate  different  learning  schemes  using  age  with  and  without  multi-­task  methods,  within  the  UCSF  pediatric  severe  sepsis  data  set  (Aim  1).  To  exploit  an  expert-­proposed  network  graph  structure  for  comorbidity-­described  pediatric  subpopulations  that  provides  superior  predictive  performance  over  naïve  methods  and  graphs,  both  for  the  overall  population  and  for  underserved  subpopulations  (Aim  2).  Methods:  We  propose  to  use  multi-­task  methods  that  penalize  deviations  between  classifiers  on  neighboring  tasks  and  that  iteratively  learn  the  strength  of  these  links.  These  methods  will  be  compared with total task independence, or passing age into classifier training as an ordinary input. Criteria for  Success:  Success  will  be  shown  by  4-­hour  pre-­onset  AUROC  gains  of  0.02  (overall  population)  and  0.03  for  the previously weakest of three age subpopulations (2-­5, 6-­12, and 13-­17 yrs;; 4-­hour pre-­onset prediction, p <  0.05, McNemar’s test, 4-­fold cross-­validation). The best structure for mapping similarities between comorbidity  tasks will improve the overall AUROC by 0.03 (p < 0.05) and by 0.07 for ≥ 2 comorbidity subpopulations of ≥ 100 patients (p < 0.05). Outcome: These improvements will enable InSight to deliver strong sepsis predictive  performance across the widely heterogeneous pediatric population.         Narrative  Pediatric  sepsis  can  be  difficult  to  diagnose,  in  part  because the  pediatric  population  is  highly  heterogeneous;;  clinical  decision  support  (CDS)  systems  have  the  potential  to  aid  in  the  diagnosis  and  prediction  of  pediatric  sepsis, if the underlying diversity of the pediatric population is correctly addressed. We will develop a machine-­ learning-­based  sepsis  CDS  system  by  using  multi-­task  learning  techniques  to  define  a  set  of  “tasks,”  each  corresponding  to  predicting  severe  sepsis  in  a  clinically  distinct  subpopulation  of  pediatric  inpatients,  together  with  a  set  of  inter-­task  connections  that  share  information  between  similar  subpopulations.    This  will  enable  improved sepsis prediction across the widely heterogeneous and underserved pediatric patient population.     ",Pediatric sepsis prediction: a machine learning solution for patient

"LemurDx - Objectivity,  precision, and clinical utility in hyperactivity measurement for childhood ADHD using smartwatches and machine learning algorithms. Project Summary / Abstract ADHD is the most common behavioral diagnosis in early childhood, affecting around 5% of all American children. Although hyperactivity is a core symptom of ADHD, there are no objective measures that are widely used in practice settings. LemurDx is a concept for a software system for smartwatches and mobile tablets, optimized for clinical use, that uses state-of-the-art, yet relatively low-cost, sensor technology to measure hyperactivity, with the clinical goal of differentiating children with ADHD-hyperactive presentation or ADHD combined presentation from children with typical levels of activity. LemurDx will passively collect data from smartwatch sensors. Clinicians will ask a child to wear a smartwatch with the LemurDx application for one day and then collect the de-identified data. The data will be transmitted to a HIPAA-compliant secure server. Machine learning (ML) algorithms will be used to differentiate children with clinical levels of hyperactivity from those with typical levels of activity, providing clinicians with immediate results. LemurDx is superior to research-focused tools such as traditional actigraphy in a number of ways. Along with the improved precision afforded by modern smartwatch sensors (many of which are not available on actigraphy devices) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, the team is carefully designing a complete system based on the unique needs of clinicians. This includes a comprehensive system of secure HIPAA-compliant servers, automated state-of-the- art ML algorithms, pre-programmed mobile tablets and smartwatches for clinical use, a secure and de- identified data architecture, and a simple user interface that eliminates any technological burden on clinicians. Aim 1 of the project is to develop a commercial grade prototype of LemurDx following principles of user- centered design, with feedback from focus groups including children, parents, and clinicians. Aim 2 of the project is to test the feasibility of collecting, storing, and analyzing data from 30 children (ages 6-11) who will wear a smartwatch with LemurDx technology for one day. Aim 3 of the project is to test and refine several ML algorithms to achieve a high level of sensitivity and specificity to accurately classify children with and without ADHD. LemurDx is significant as there is no objective and commercially available measure of hyperactivity to assist in the diagnosis of ADHD, despite a great need in settings including pediatric primary-care practices, children’s hospitals, and behavioral health clinics. The project is consistent with NICHD’s mission to ensure, “that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives.” Innovations include a combination of reliable, inexpensive measurement technology combined with accurate ML algorithms to consistently and objectively measure hyperactivity in a system that is designed for clinical users. We will show that LemurDx has commercialization potential by demonstrating accuracy, cost effectiveness, and user adherence, and will lay the foundation for the development of a scalable clinical delivery system. Project Narrative ADHD is the most common behavioral diagnosis in early childhood affecting around 5% of all American children. Although hyperactivity is a core symptom of ADHD, there are no objective measures that are widely used in practice settings that can assist in accurate diagnostics. This project will develop a prototype for a software system for smartwatches to measure hyperactivity with objectivity and precision using state-of-the-art sensors and machine learning algorithms.","LemurDx - Objectivity,  precision, and clinical utility in hyperactivity measurement for childhood ADHD using smartwatches and machine learning algorithms.",9558075,R41MH119644,"['Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Consumer Satisfaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Hour', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'actigraphy', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'commercialization', 'computer human interaction', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'early childhood', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'practice setting', 'product development', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'societal costs', 'software systems', 'standardize measure', 'stimulant abuse', 'success', 'teacher', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'wearable technology']",NIMH,NURELM E-BUSINESS SOFTWARE,R41,2018,221917,0.013470581609214468
"Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings Abstract Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare resources. Treatment of diarrhea is mostly empiric, with antibiotic use mostly based on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from antibiotic use, and inappropriate use leads to toxicity and resistance. Furthermore, despite the increasing availability of rapid molecular testing, there is little data to base a decision of whom or when to test. Our overarching goal is to develop and validate clinical decision tools for management of diarrheal illnesses in children of both high and low resource settings. We will utilize prospectively-collected data from two recently-completed multicenter cohort studies of pediatric diarrhea. These studies feature extensive etiologic testing, well-characterized clinical elements, and longitudinal outcome data. We have assembled a team with expertise in pediatric diarrhea, clinical prediction rules, and machine learning methods. In Aim 1, we will use domestic data to develop and validate: a) a score for bacterial etiology, and b) a score for which patients are likely to benefit from further testing. We will derive the scores using data from IMPACT, an NIH-sponsored study of 1200 children from 5 US Emergency Departments, and validate using electronic health records from the Utah Intermountain Health System. In Aim 2, we will use international data to develop and validate: a) a diagnostic score for bacterial etiology, and b) a prognostic score for risk stratification of children who go on to poor outcomes. We will derive the scores using data from GEMS, a study of over 9400 children across 7 low-resource countries, and validate using VIDA study of children in 3 African countries. Completion of the Aims will result in the availability of a number of clinical tools that healthcare workers worldwide can use for evidence-based care of children with diarrhea. Project Narrative Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The management of childhood diarrhea often depend on what type of pathogen is responsible, but in many cases testing is not affordable or feasible. We propose studies to develop clinical scores to make it easier for healthcare workers to decide how to manage children with diarrhea.",Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings,9596046,R01AI135114,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Africa', 'African', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Case Management', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Enteral', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Income', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sample Size', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Utah', 'Vaccines', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical diagnostics', 'evidence base', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'microbial', 'molecular diagnostics', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2018,457033,0.05525216187229451
"A computational approach to early sepsis detection Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project, we propose to improve the performance of InSight, a machine-learning- based sepsis screening system, in situations of limited training data from the target clinical site. The proposed work will make possible prospective clinical deployments to sites which are smaller or lack clinical data repositories, by significantly reducing the amount of training data necessary down to a few weeks of clinical observation. Classically, a machine-learning-based system like InSight requires complete retraining for each new clinical setting, in turn requiring a new and large collection of data from each target deployment site. We will circumvent this requirement via transfer learning techniques, which transfer knowledge acquired previously in a source clinical setting to a new, target setting. Research Questions: Which transfer learning methods and paired classification algorithms are most suitable for use with InSight, requiring minimal target-site training data while maintaining strong performance? Are these methods and algorithms robust across the several common sepsis-spectrum definitions? Prior Work: We have developed InSight using the MIMIC-III retrospective data set, on which it attains an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.88 for sepsis detection, and 0.74 for 4-hour early sepsis prediction. We have also conducted pilot transfer learning  ≥ experiments in a different clinical task, mortality forecasting, in which transfer learning yields a 10-fold reduction in the amount of target-site training data required to achieve AUROC 0.80. Specific Aims: Aim 1 - to implement and assess side-by-side four diverse transfer learning methods for a retrospective clinical sepsis prediction task, where the source data set is MIMIC-III and the simulated clinical target is a data set drawn from UCSF. Aim 2 - to determine which among the best methods from Aim 1 also provide robust performance when applied to two additional sepsis-spectrum gold standards. Methods: We will prepare implementations of transfer learning methods which use instance transfer, residual learning and/or feature augmentation, kernel length scale transfer, and feature transfer. We will test these methods with applicable classifiers on subsets of the UCSF set, using cross-validation and quantifying discrimination performance in terms of AUROC. The best method/classifier pairs will require no more than 30 examples of septic patients from the target set and attain AUROC superiorities of 0.05 in 0- and 4-hour pre-onset sepsis prediction/detection, relative to the best tested alternative screening systems (Aim 1). The top three pairs will then be tested for robustness to gold standard choice, using septic shock (0- and 4-hour) and SIRS-based sepsis (0-hour) gold standards; in these tests, at least one pair must again attain 0.05 margin of superiority in AUROC versus the alternative screening systems (Aim 2). Future Directions: The results of these experiments will enable InSight to be robustly deployed to diverse clinical sites, yielding high performance without the need for extensive target-site data acquisition. Narrative Clinical decision support (CDS) systems present critical information to medical professionals by examining patient data and providing relevant information. Machine learning is a powerful method for creating CDS tools, but accessing its full strength requires re-training with retrospective data from each target clinical site. We will use transfer learning techniques to dramatically reduce the amount of target-site training data required by InSight, our machine-learning-based CDS tool for sepsis prediction, and empirically evaluate several such methods on a patient data set, using three different sepsis-related gold standards.",A computational approach to early sepsis detection,9557664,R43TR002221,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Collection', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Discrimination', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'performance site', 'portability', 'prospective', 'screening', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'success', 'support tools']",NCATS,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,310782,0.014663934404169155
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"The Home Evaluation, Assessment, Rating and Training of Gait (HEART-Gait) System for Monitoring Toe-Walking Severity in Children with Cerebral Palsy 1 Project Summary  2 Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a group of disorders attributed to non-progressive alterations occurring in the brain dur-  3 ing fetal and newborn development. These alterations affect movement, development and posture, causing  4 significant lifetime functional limitations. CP is the most common motor disorder in children, affecting 500,000  5 individuals in the US alone. Children with CP are commonly affected by gait impairments. One of the most  6 common impairments is equinus gait, or “toe-walking”, which is characterized by predominantly plantarflexed  7 feet during the whole gait cycle. Different interventions are available to treat equinus gait in children with CP  8 and include physical therapy, orthoses, botulinum toxin injections and surgery. To determine which intervention  9 is most appropriate to restore mobility for a given patient, periodic gait evaluations are performed in the clinic. 10 This Phase I SBIR proposal will develop a wearable system (Home Evaluation, Assessment, Rating and Train- 11 ing of Gait, HEART-Gait system) that continuously monitors and analyses simple gait parameters in children 12 with CP outside the clinical laboratory and during normal daily activities, which will provide clinically useful out- 13 comes data not currently available and critical diagnostic data for determining intervention timing. With access 14 to continuous data, the medical team is better informed and can effectively plan treatment, thus improving the 15 quality of care and the lives of children with CP and their families. Specific Aims are 16 Aim 1. Develop working prototype of HEART-Gait: Milestones are: 17 MS1: Veristride will optimize sensor selection and placement; construct prototype data acquisition hardware, 18 firmware and software. Months 1-2. 19 Aim 2. Iteratively design HEART-Gait system: Milestones are: 20 MS2: Veristride and the Spaulding team will work closely to modify the prototype system to make it suitable for 21 monitoring toe-walking in children with CP. Months 2-5. 22 MS3: The Spaulding team will interview 10 clinicians (unaffiliated with the project) and 10 families (guardians 23 and children) to gather their feedback about the HEART-Gait system. Months 2-5. 24 Aim 3. Evaluate the feasibility of HEART-Gait: Milestones are: 25 MS4: The Spaulding team will recruit 20 children (5-12 years) with CP and toe-walking pattern. Data will be 26 collected simultaneously from HEART-Gait and camera-based motion capture. Months 5-10. 27 MS5. The Spaulding team will derive a clinical index of the severity of toe-walking based on ankle biomechan- 28 ics data collected using the camera-based motion capture system. Months 6-11. 29 MS6. Veristride will collaborate with Spaulding team to develop machine-learning algorithms to estimate toe- 30 walking severity and characterize accuracy. Months 7-12. 31 Narrative Equinus gait, or “toe-walking”, is commonly observed in children with cerebral palsy (CP), and can be treated by a variety of treatments. This SBIR proposal will develop a wearable system that continuously monitors and analyses simple gait parameters in children with CP outside the clinical laboratory and during normal daily activities, which will provide clinically useful outcomes data not currently available and critical diagnostic data for determining intervention timing. With access to continuous data, the medical team is better informed and can effectively plan treatment, thus improving the quality of care and the lives of children with CP and their families.","The Home Evaluation, Assessment, Rating and Training of Gait (HEART-Gait) System for Monitoring Toe-Walking Severity in Children with Cerebral Palsy",9467293,R43LM013104,"['Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Biomechanics', 'Boston', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Services', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Gait', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Newborn Infant', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthotic Devices', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Physicians', 'Posture', 'Prevalence', 'Quality of Care', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Severities', 'Shoes', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toes', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'data acquisition', 'fetal', 'foot', 'gait rehabilitation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'iterative design', 'monitoring device', 'motor disorder', 'physical therapist', 'pressure', 'primary outcome', 'prototype', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'treatment planning', 'wearable technology']",NLM,"VERISTRIDE, INC.",R43,2018,224740,0.027846493197410598
"Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use across different clinical centers; (2) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post- surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a multi-center study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 focus on relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology, developed at Texas Children's Hospital, which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor,9577420,R01HL142994,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Ventricle', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'mortality', 'news', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,644011,0.054204317510767465
"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design. The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis. ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",9419932,R01HD087363,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergent care', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data registry', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electronic registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient registry', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'septic patients', 'support tools', 'wasting']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,623932,0.02067065845989951
"Nasal biomarkers of asthma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects 9.3% of children and 8.0% of adults in the US. Mild to moderate asthma can be difficult to diagnose and manage given waxing and waning symptoms. The airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation that underlie asthma are challenging to assess regularly and easily. Given the accessibility of the nose for assessment and monitoring, it is clinically and scientifically compelling to identify nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. To date, several lower airway pathogens have been associated with asthma. In separate studies, host gene expression in the airway has been associated with asthma. Host and microbes undoubtedly interact in asthma. A nasal biomarker that could accurately identify mild/moderate asthma and provide information on host vs. microbial contributions and their relative causality to disease would be highly useful for clinical care and research. We hypothesize that causal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma can be identified through network-based examination of nasal gene expression and microbiota. We will recruit subjects with mild/moderate asthma, severe asthma, and controls from whom we will generate the first paired system-wide profiles of host and microbiome in asthma. In Aim 1, we will focus on host characterization and identify nasal transcript biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma by RNA-sequence profiling of nasal brushings, differential gene expression analysis, and machine learning. In Aim 2, we will perform the first study of the nasal microbiome in asthma to identify nasal microbial biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. We will generate 16S rRNA data from nasal swabs to identify bacterial taxa associated with mild/moderate asthma, apply metagenomic inference to ascertain their functions, perform metagenomic sequencing for identification of non-bacterial taxa, and apply machine learning to distinguish microbial classifiers of mild/moderate asthma. We will be the first to reconstruct bacterial functions associated with asthma through metagenomic inference, and the first to apply metagenomic sequencing to well- characterized asthmatics. In Aim 3, we will identify causal nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma through data-driven, network approaches that integrate genetic, transcriptome, microbiome, and clinical data. We will link host to microbiome by constructing interaction networks, characterize the association between genetic variation and gene expression by eQTL detection, and infer causal drivers of mild/moderate asthma through Bayesian network construction. We will project asthma-specific subnetworks onto our networks, and compare our networks to those for other respiratory diseases to identify coherent modules of genes and microbes dysregulated in asthma. In all aims, we will assess for relevance to asthma more broadly by testing for the identified biomarkers in nasal and bronchial samples from severe asthmatics. We expect that our results will lead to the development of a nasal test that can be used for the clinical management and investigation of mild/moderate asthma, a prevalent disease that is currently suboptimally diagnosed and managed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma impairs quality of life and leads to emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and sometimes death in people of all ages and walks of life. To identify noninvasive, predictive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we will comprehensively profile and examine nasal gene expression and the nasal microbial community in subjects with mild/moderate and severe asthma. We will use computational biology to construct networks that reflect the interactions and interconnectivity of host and microbes in asthma, and identify nasal biomarker candidates that we expect will lead to a nasal test for asthma.",Nasal biomarkers of asthma,9472205,R01AI118833,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Network-based', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Waxes', 'airway inflammation', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'bronchial epithelium', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'epidemiologic data', 'forest', 'fungus', 'genetic analysis', 'host microbiome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'nasal microbiome', 'nasal microbiota', 'pathogen', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus identification']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,714746,0.09796373503614768
"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,9395904,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,352587,-0.029573390187382777
"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration. Project Narrative Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases remains a leading cause of death in both children and adults worldwide, yet no clinical tools have ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. The proposed research will both develop and validate an innovative new mobile phone based platform for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents, and older children with acute diarrhea. This new mobile health tool will help physicians, nurses, and other providers worldwide to determine the best management strategies for patients with acute diarrhea, potentially improving and rationalizing care for the hundreds of millions of patients each year presenting to healthcare facilities around the world with acute diarrhea.",Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease,9593233,R01DK116163,"['5 year old', 'Acute Diarrhea', 'Admission activity', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bangladesh', 'Beds', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'IV Fluid', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'International Unit', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Provider', 'Rehydration Solutions', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'international center', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2018,544336,0.016142454255505447
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9418100,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2018,551823,0.021643949912048356
"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,9503067,R01MH104030,"['Advertisements', 'Age', 'Anniversary', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'brain abnormalities', 'caudate nucleus', 'comparison group', 'critical period', 'dexterity', 'follow-up', 'habit learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical attention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomenological models', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'secondary analysis', 'vector']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,636092,0.026603378336026936
"Perinatal Origins of Asthma Project Abstract  Early in life many children develop wheezing which can be a sign of early-onset asthma. Yet, not all children who experience wheezing episodes develop asthma. Predicting asthma that begins early in life is important as those who develop early-onset asthma are more likely to have persistent symptoms and structural changes to the lung. Identification and early intervention of high risk individuals could prevent long term lung function abnormalities and provide an alternative to costly treatment. To date, risk prediction models for early- onset asthma are limited mainly to clinical history and presentation. Additionally, no one model contains both reliable sensitivity and specificity or clinically valid serological predictors for early-onset asthma.  Our laboratory has focused previously on immunologic responses to common asthmatic triggers, house dust mite (HMD) and cockroach allergens, between individuals and how these responses differ between populations and outcomes. We have identified increased lymphoproliferation and cytokine response (IL-13) in allergen-stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) derived from individuals who are atopic or African- Americans. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan, stimulate the cytokine production of IL-13 and IFN-γ. In this proposal our preliminary data indicate that the production of IL-13 after allergen exposure in CBMCs is associated with exposure to different microbiota. In addition, early exposure to Moraxellaceae greatly enhances IL-13 production by CBMCs after exposure to HDM. Taken together, our data suggest that early-life bacterial exposure may enhance the production of cytokines that can alter host physiology and immunity.  In this translational medicine proposal, we will build a predictive model for early-onset asthma that will be applicable to general and high risk populations. Our approach will include high-throughput techniques to assess bacterial exposure and immunologic response in the perinatal time period. We will integrate the large amount of data generated into a pipeline with machine learning algorithms that will be regulated specifically for the prediction of later onset of disease. In addition, we will assess bacterial exposure in association with mothers who carry risks for asthma development in their children. The proposed studies will address both the need of predictive model for early-onset asthma and identify bacterial-host interactions associated with high risk populations (e.g. maternal risk factors). Together, these studies form the platform for multidisciplinary training in microbe- immune interactions, predictive risk for asthma, bioinformatics and form a solid foundation to launch a successful career as a physician- scientist. Project Narrative Asthma is the most common chronic disorder of childhood. Early-onset asthma, if left untreated, leads to long term respiratory dysfunction, and currently, no clinical tools reliably aid in prediction of asthma. Therefore, this proposal aims to develop a predictive model for asthma involving microbial and immune interactions that will be applicable to the general and high risk populations.",Perinatal Origins of Asthma,9707680,F30HL136001,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic rhinitis', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Bacterial DNA', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dictyoptera', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemophilus', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Interferon Type II', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mononuclear', 'Moraxella', 'Moraxellaceae', 'Mothers', 'Obesity', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Peptidoglycan', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Pyroglyphidae', 'Recording of previous events', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Solid', 'Streptococcus', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States', 'Wheezing', 'airway remodeling', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'care costs', 'career', 'cockroach allergen', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'individual response', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiota', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'persistent symptom', 'predictive modeling', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'respiratory colonization', 'respiratory health', 'response', 'smoking during pregnancy', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F30,2018,49524,0.08854984363204584
"Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data, Modeling, and Coordination Center (DMCC) for the NHLBI's Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network. The objective of PrecISE is to conduct sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials with precision interventions in stratified patient with severe asthma populations. Patients with severe asthma are heterogeneous, and thus a hard to treat population. Precision medicine interventions, which focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients instead of the best treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this complex patient population. The PrecISE Network is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating Clinical Center investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for PrecISE trials. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include PrecISE information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other key features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to PrecISE by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the PrecISE Network. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for the execution of high-impact, sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials in the PrecISE Network, which can lead to the establishment of potential personalized treatment approaches for patients with severe and/or exacerbation-prone asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe asthma affects 10% of people worldwide, and despite currently available treatments, asthma remains poorly controlled for many patients. The National Institutes of Health is funding a new iteration of previous high- impact asthma clinical trials networks, which will take a personalized medicine approach to identify new therapies for severe asthma, tailored to an individual patient using data-based treatment algorithms that leverage information on his/her individual disease and treatment history. Our proposal is to provide leadership and statistical research support to this network.","Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network",9571016,U24HL138998,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Calendar', 'Case Report Form', 'Certification', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Files', 'Data Reporting', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Gills', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Online Systems', 'Operations Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Writing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'data management', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'material transfer agreement', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'repository', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2018,12971526,0.04675424901581135
"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining longitudinal multimodal brain imaging and high- dimensional behavioral assessments in school-age children together with sophisticated data analytic techniques to increase precision when linking heterogeneous ECAs and child outcome with the goal of predicting mental health outcomes and identifying children who would benefit most from specific early interventions.  ",Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities,9552270,R01MH091864,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Orphanages', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'caregiving', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'foster care', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'middle childhood', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prepuberty', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'violence exposure']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2018,753980,0.035373138290661195
"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS This application is being submitted to PA-18-591 in accordance with NOT-OD-18-194. The proposed supplement INCLUDE project is entitled: “Upper Airway Structure and Function and Risk for OSA in Children with Down Syndrome”. The project is within the scope of R01 HL130468 entitled: “A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS” that focuses on implementing state-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during wake and sleep conditions (Aim 1A) using analytical and machine learning techniques to determine the static (3D) and dynamic (4D) architecture and tissue characteristics of the upper airway in wake and sleep conditions (Aim 1B). These methods are coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) (Aim 2A) and biomechanical modeling (Aim 2B) to establish the biomechanical basis of OSAS in children with obesity. The parent grant also evaluates the impact of treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on airway mechanics (Aim 3A) and the clinical utility of image-based airway mechanical parameters in OSAS (Aim 3B). The tools and methodologies used in the parent project will be integrated in all Aims of this INCLUDE project. The proposed project addresses 2 important IC-specific priorities of NHLBI: 1) “Incorporation of individuals with Down syndrome into existing disease cohorts and clinical trials directed toward sleep apnea. This could include collection of tissue or blood specimens and -omics data generation and analysis, imaging, and computational modeling”, 2) Identification of potential risk and resilience factors that make individuals with Down syndrome susceptible to transient or persistent blood disorders and congenital heart disease”. The problem: Down syndrome (DS) (trisomy 21) is the most common genetic cause of developmental disability and mental retardation with an incidence of 1/800 live births (1). The prevalence of OSA in these children is very high and estimated between 50-95% (2-5), and much higher than the 1-4% prevalence in the general pediatric population (6). OSA has detrimental consequences in children, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and cognitive effects (6). This is particularly true for children with Down syndrome who are already predisposed to congenital heart anomalies and developmental delay. Therefore, the American Academy of pediatrics (AAP) emphasizes the need to screen for OSA within the first 6 months of life in all children with Down syndrome and continue to evaluate for the disorder on all medical encounters thereafter throughout childhood (7). Anatomical factors related to the Down syndrome phenotype have been attributed to the causation of OSA in this group. These include midfacial and mandibular hypoplasia (8-11), enlarged tongue (12, 13), adenoid and tonsilar hypertrophy (13, 14), laryngo-tracheal anomalies (15), and obesity (16-19). In addition, reduced neuromuscular tone has been suspected of having a role in the development of OSA in these subjects (3). Traditional methods to evaluate the upper airway in children with DS include plain lateral neck radiograph, cephalometric measurements, airway fluoroscopy, and nasal pharyngoscopy (8, 15, 20, 21). However, these methods provide only limited information regarding the entire upper airway structure. During the years our group has developed,applied, and published seminal work on the upper airway structure and function of children using MRI methodology (22-35). This body of work on normal children and children with craniofacial abnormalities including DS created a large MRI database that is the basis for the current proposal. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9772627,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', 'Academy', 'Address', 'Airway Resistance', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Coupled', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Etiology', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematological Disease', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Live Birth', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mandible', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Mental Retardation', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neck', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nose', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Tonsil', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiometabolism', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'design', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'neuromuscular', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'parent grant', 'parent project', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'shear stress', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2018,420407,-0.002000091470354591

"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9481329,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'ROC Curve', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'Treatment outcome', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiometabolism', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2018,123110,0.025287160055924133
"Technology and Parent-Child Interaction PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Radesky is a board-certified Developmental Behavioral Pediatrician whose prior research and clinical work has focused on the importance of early childhood experiences in shaping long-term developmental and behavioral outcomes, particularly in low-income children. Her research has examined how digital media – including television and mobile devices such as smartphones – interacts with the early-parent child relationship, both being shaped by, and shaping, parenting behaviors and child social-emotional development. This mentored career development award will allow her to learn additional methodologies for assessing parent- child interaction and mobile device usage by parents. She has identified a comprehensive, trans-disciplinary mentoring team at the University of Michigan Departments of Pediatrics, Health Behavior and Health Education, Psychiatry, Psychology, Communications, and Informatics, as well as the Center for Human Growth and Development, to provide methodological and content expertise, including: Julie Lumeng, MD; Alison Miller, PhD; Katherine Rosenblum, PhD; Scott W. Campbell, PhD; and Mark Newman, PhD. This team of mentors and advisors will help guide her towards the following Training and Career Goals: 1. Develop working knowledge of theoretical models of parent-child interaction 2. Develop skills in using mobile devices to collect usage data and ecologic momentary assessment of parent  emotional states 3. Develop skills in research methods to assess parent-child interaction, including:  a) Behavioral coding of parent-child interaction from videotape  b) Language Environment Analysis (LENA) audiorecording to measure parent-child verbal interaction 4. Learn statistical analytic techniques unique to assessing parent-child interaction 5. Develop familiarity with the field of information science/human-computer interaction to inform future studies. Healthy social-emotional development in young children relies on sensitive, responsive parent-child interactions, particularly in children growing up in adversity. Screen media use is a highly prevalent behavior that may be a modifiable barrier to responsive parent-child interactions. Despite rapid increases in the use of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) by families with young children, there is a paucity of research examining associations between mobile device use and parent-child interactions. This research plan focuses on testing a conceptual model that parent and child traits predict how parents use mobile devices during family activities, and that certain features of this device use (particularly their emotional response to it) predict changes in parent-child interaction. This model also examines temporal contingencies in parent-child interaction and mobile device use, in order to help clarify directionality. This conceptual model will be tested through 3 Specific Aims: Aim 1) Test the hypotheses that parent depressive symptoms, lower parenting self-efficacy, higher parenting stress, and child difficult temperament and lower child emotion regulation are associated with higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use. Aim 2) Test the hypotheses that higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use are associated with less parent-child verbal exchange, lower parental responsivity, more parent-child conflict, and lower parent ability to read child behavioral cues. Aim 3) Determine whether changes in parent-child interaction (changes in parent and child affect, verbal exchange, parent responsivity, parent-child conflict, or parent ability to read child behavioral cues) occur before or after parent mobile device use. These Specific Aims will be carried out in two complementary cohorts: A) 296 low-income mother-child dyads enrolled in an existing cohort study with previously collected videotapes of home mealtimes, during which mobile devices are commonly used; and B) 100 parent-child dyads from a range of socioeconomic status backgrounds who will be followed for 4 days of data collection with continuous mobile device-based passive sensing of the parent's mobile device use, coordinated with simultaneous audiorecording of parent-child interaction using Language Environment Analysis (LENA) technology. Future Implications: The results from this work will contribute to an evidence base about how families can use the explosion of new media in their households in the healthiest ways possible, both through the formation of clinical guidelines and future interventional approaches. PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Despite the rapidly increasing ownership and use of mobile technology by parents and evidence showing that older technologies such as television displace important parent-child interactions, remarkably little research has examined the effects of mobile device use on families. This proposal examines which parent-child dyads are at highest risk of disturbances in parent-child interaction from mobile devices, how parent mobile device use precedes or follows changes in parent-child interactions, and the behavioral mechanisms underlying these associations. We anticipate that our findings will be applied to clinical guidelines for mobile device use by families, interventions to help improve parent-child engagement in the highest risk families, and the development of technologies that might be better designed to not intrude upon family time.",Technology and Parent-Child Interaction,9538823,K23HD092626,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Attention', 'Audiotape', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Caregivers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communication', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Familiarity', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Hearing', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Sciences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Observational Study', 'Ownership', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Provider', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Speech', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'career', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'digital media', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'irritation', 'mobile computing', 'pediatric department', 'pediatrician', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'skills', 'social', 'technology development', 'theories', 'trait']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2018,167319,0.01761997841373465
"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate. In this application, we propose to develop and assess the validity of an in-home objective, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system, called FLASH that has the potential to revolutionize the measurement of screen use behaviors.",Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH,9461051,R01DK113269,"['10 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'Asses', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral outcome', 'college', 'cost', 'diaries', 'field study', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity development', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'tv watching', 'validation studies']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,435074,-0.018679757357099928
"Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED) PROJECT SUMMARY In this application, I am requesting support from a career development award to support my research proposal titled “Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction”. I will be undertaking this work with the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Gordon (Primary US mentor) at the Washington University, St Louis and Dr. Asad Ali (Primary LMIC mentor) at the Aga Khan University. This project builds on our existing studies of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The current application aims to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of EED by studying the evolution of gut microbial configuration in children who have clinical and histological evidence of EED. EED is common in children living in impoverished conditions with limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Histopathological changes of EED in small bowel mucosa include alteration in crypt to villous ratio along with lymphocytic infiltration of the villous epithelium and lamina propria. Although studies involving biopsies of small bowel mucosa are critical to study EED, these studies are uncommon because of logistic challenges involving performing endoscopies in field settings in LMICs. We have previously demonstrated in an ongoing BMGF funded study that we are able to safely obtain such biopsies, we now have a unique opportunity to study the relationship between gut microbiome evolution and EED in this cohort. The central hypothesis of the current application is that children with histological confirmation of EED have shared features of a bacterial community which is different from healthy controls and non-EED subjects, and that such changes in bacterial configuration are associated with enteric and systemic inflammation. For testing these hypotheses, evaluation of gut microbiome in healthy and stunted children will be carried out to identify the age discriminatory bacterial taxa in children with and without confirmation of EED. Dr. Gordon will be providing mentorship and experience in gut microbiome and microbiota analysis. Dr. Ali will provide the needed infrastructure of the field site and laboratory facilities, along with linking the microbiome analysis with clinical and histological outcomes of interest. The Aga Khan University is a leading regional research institute with multiple support systems for junior investigators which will be vital for my career transition as an independent scientist. My long term goal is to be the principal investigator of my own laboratory, focusing on studying the gut microbiome and its relationship with communicable and non-communicable diseases. I envision working on microbiota derived therapy for EED, and to find targets in the inflammatory pathways driven by changes in gut homeostasis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Globally, Pakistan has the third highest rate of stunting among children aged < 5 years. Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) is proposed to be a critical factor responsible for chronic growth faltering in children in resource limited settings. This research utilizes an innovative approach to study a program of postnatal gut microbiome development in children and its impact on child growth. This proposal will provide an ideal training platform for a translational scientist, covering the domains of mucosal immunology, histopathology, computational analysis, microbiome analysis and host immune responses. The skills learnt from this project will be critical for the capacity development of both the LMIC institution and the candidate herself.","Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED)",9549157,K43TW010697,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Duodenum', 'Endoscopy', 'Enteral', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Gut Mucosa', 'Height', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Homeostasis', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Institution', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lamina Propria', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Small Intestines', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Sustainable Development', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Villous', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'drinking water', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'fecal microbiota', 'forest', 'global health', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'host microbiome', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intestinal villi', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiota', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'skills', 'translational scientist']",FIC,AGA KHAN UNIVERSITY (PAKISTAN),K43,2018,62726,0.026634725756415935
"SCH: kHealth: Semantic Multisensory Mobile Approach to Personalized Asthma Care ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The proliferation of smartphones and sensors has made continuous monitoring of physiology, environment, and public health notifications possible. However, personalized digital health and patient empowerment will become reality only if massive multisensory and multimodal observational data is processed within patient context and made actionable to enable early detection; better diagnosis, effective prevention and treatment of the disease; and improve the quality of life. This research will be performed in the context of asthma, which affects 300 million people and claims over 250,000 lives worldwide annually. According to CDC, 9.3% of US children have asthma. Understanding asthma and its management is challenging; it is a multifactorial disease with subjective causes and symptoms, and extant diagnosis and treatment guidelines can be improved using evidence-based action recommendation. With the advent of mobile and connected sensors, timely information about asthma triggers has become available, and its exploitation requires precisely understanding and quantifying the sensed data's role for preventive and proactive assessment of asthma. In this application led by computer scientists and a practicing clinician, we address the central problem of deriving actionable information from data monitored using kHealth technology. Through a pilot study, we have tested our kHealth kit equipped on several pediatric patients under the guidance of a clinical doctor for reliable data collection and patient operation, with promising initial results. We build on this foundation by addressing the problem of semantic representation, integration, abstraction, and personalized interpretation of heterogeneous observations spanning physiological, environmental data, and online data in the context of medical knowledge. Our primary hypothesis is that an evidence-based approach to asthma can help doctors determine more precisely the cause, severity and control of asthma, and can alert patients to seek timely clinical assistance to better manage asthma. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This application direclty relates to NICHD mission of improving health of children, with focus on asthma that affects a significant population. The kHealth system uses multiple sensors, mobile application and intelligent, personalized processing to predict health risks associated with asthma in children to develop a preventative and proactive approach to asthma management.",SCH: kHealth: Semantic Multisensory Mobile Approach to Personalized Asthma Care,9526514,R01HD087132,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Albuterol', 'Algorithms', 'Ambrosia', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Big Data', 'Biological Sciences', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clupeidae', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dust', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Environment', 'Environment and Public Health', 'Environmental Wind', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Finding by Cause', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Communication', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Hydrocarbons', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Inhalators', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molds', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nebulizer', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Notification', 'Office Visits', 'Ontology', 'Ozone', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Perception', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pollen', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Serinus', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Wheezing', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'asthma prevention', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'empowered', 'empowerment', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'grass pollen', 'handheld mobile device', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'member', 'men', 'mid-career faculty', 'mobile application', 'multimodality', 'multisensory', 'operation', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'sound', 'statistics', 'treatment guidelines', 'tree pollen', 'trend', 'web services']",NICHD,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,295924,0.11307976732856947
"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,9553779,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA analysis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'dysbiosis', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'fecal microbiome', 'fecal microbiota', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gene complementation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'stool sample', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,619708,0.01726785952632485
"Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record Project Summary/Abstract Sepsis is a critical illness syndrome characterized by infection leading to life-threatening organ failure. Affecting over 200,000 individuals in the United States each year, sepsis accounts for nearly half of all hospital deaths and over $20 billion in yearly US hospital costs. Despite the development and dissemination of evidence-based guidelines, most patients with sepsis do not consistently receive recommended care, resulting in preventable morbidity and mortality. Consequently, there is increasing interest in implementing health policies designed to incentivize quality improvement at the hospital level. The largest and most prominent of these policies to date is the new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) quality reporting initiative, known as SEP-1. SEP-1 requires hospitals to report their compliance with a variety of evidence-based care processes, including timely antibiotic administration, timely volume resuscitation, and routine monitoring of the clinical response to therapy. SEP-1 is unique among quality measures in the CMS Inpatient Quality Reporting Program, both because it is the only measure based on a critical illness syndrome and because it is of unparalleled complexity, requiring the coordinated efforts of multiple health care providers across the acute care spectrum. As a consequence, it is essential to understand how SEP-1 has affected patient care and clinical outcomes. To address this need, we propose to comprehensively evaluate the impact of the SEP-1 measure using the electronic health record (EHR) of a large multihospital health system. An EHR-based approach will allow us to understand the impact of the policy in exceptional detail, yielding actionable data not only for policy makers seeking to refine SEP-1 but also for health systems seeking to respond to SEP-1 in a way that maximizes the potential benefits. First, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis recognition and documentation using natural language processing of clinical notes. Second, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis care processes using structured data elements such as vital signs, laboratory values, and medication administration. Third, we will evaluate the impact of the program on patient mortality, length of stay, and requirement for organ support. In all aims we will examine both overall effects and hospital-specific effects, providing an understanding of how hospitals and health systems implement quality improvement in the context of a novel reporting mandate. Together, these aims will yield important new insights into how clinicians and hospitals implement new quality reporting programs. At the same time, through a program of structured mentorship, career development, and stakeholder involvement, this project will provide the principal investigator with new skills in the use of the EHR to evaluate health care quality and the impact of system-level health policies, uniquely positioning him to lead future efforts to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate EHR-based performance interventions for critically ill patients. NARRATIVE Sepsis is a life-threatening response to infection and accounts for significant morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs in the United States. In this proposal, we will use data from the electronic health record of a large health system to evaluate the effects of a novel sepsis quality reporting program on sepsis recognition, treatment, and outcomes. Our findings will yield important early information on the quality reporting program’s impact, helping to guide policy makers as they seek to refine the program and yielding novel insights into strategies to improve sepsis quality in US hospitals.",Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record,9526083,K08HS025455,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K08,2018,148403,0.002888315622045058
"Secondary data analysis of universal autism screening in a large primary care network: The impact of early autism screening on age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention (R03) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently highlighted the lack of studies examining universal autism screening in primary care and whether it leads to earlier diagnosis and treatment. This gap prevented them from being able to recommend universal autism screening until there is more evidence. CHOP has successfully implemented universal autism screening in primary care – 83% screening compliance in 2016, and has both screening and follow-up primary care available in the electronic health record. This proposal is for a secondary analysis of this data to directly answer the question of whether universal screening results in earlier identification and earlier treatment entry for children with autism. Preliminary analyses on 13,503 children found the sensitivity of the M-CHAT was surprisingly low -- 40% (specificity 94%, positive predictive value 16%, and negative predictive value of 98%). These results show that, with only one screen, more children with autism screened negative (n=198) than screened positive (n=128). This project will include a sample double this size (as more children age into the 4-6 year age range), and include the wealth of data within the EHR to accomplish two aims. Aim 1 will determine the age of diagnosis and entry into early intervention for children in a universal autism screening program. Many factors contribute to the age of diagnosis and intervention, but this dataset can answer three important questions: First, to determine the age of diagnosis and entry to intervention for children with autism who screened positive as toddlers at the first v. second screen (“true positives”). Second, to determine the age of diagnosis and early intervention for children who screened negative but went on to be diagnosed with autism (“false negatives”), since negative screening results can still lead to heightened awareness of milestones. Third, to explore the age of diagnosis and intervention for screened v. unscreened children, since a subset of children were not screened (approximately 17% of well-child visits, as well as some number of children who received sick care but did not present for well-child visits). Aim 2 will identify factors that would improve screening accuracy, and then create and validate a clinical decision tree. Pediatricians use clinical judgment to interpret screening results—this project can provide much needed evidence. Variables such as autism risk factors (e.g., family history); child demographic, medical, and developmental factors; family variables including socio-economic status and parent concerns; and practice-level variables including patient population demographics, provider years of experience, provider compliance with screening, and provider rates of referrals, could inform clinical judgment. Upon successful completion, this project will contribute the exact type of evidence from universal screening in primary care requested by the USPSTF, as well as provide guidance for pediatricians on how to fine tune their interpretation of screening results. This can significantly impact the age of diagnosis and intervention, by revealing for whom screening is and is not working well. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will analyze existing data from the highly successful universal autism screening program in our large primary care network. Our data can answer critical questions about the age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention for children screened in primary care. We can also determine whether child, family, provider, and practice variables can be used to more accurately interpret early autism screening results.","Secondary data analysis of universal autism screening in a large primary care network: The impact of early autism screening on age of diagnosis, referral, and entry into intervention (R03)",9507401,R03MH116356,"['Academy', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'American', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Awareness', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Industry Standard', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Philadelphia', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Visit', 'aged', 'base', 'control trial', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'group intervention', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'patient population', 'pediatrician', 'premature', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rural setting', 'screening', 'screening program', 'secondary analysis', 'standard of care', 'urban setting']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R03,2018,86000,-0.020920024642648676
"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance  Pediatric septic shock, a leading cause of childhood death, is often recognized late, causing preventable morbidity, and improved early diagnostic approaches would improve the timeliness of sepsis diagnosis, accelerate treatment and improve outcomes. This proposal will provide mentored research training to use predictive modeling to improve early diagnosis of pediatric sepsis, and test the delivery of clinical decision support to clinicians through the electronic health record in an implementation trial. This proposal responds to the AHRQ priorities of improving health care quality through use of information systems, improving safety and quality of care by synthesizing and communicating evidence to health care professionals, advances knowledge generation in a learning health system and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs.",Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED),9595012,K08HS025696,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K08,2018,147838,0.03596269304957286
"Rule-based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Effective Clinical Decision Support (CDS): A Pediatric Severe Sepsis Case Study using ICU Data The recognition, diagnosis, and management of sepsis remain among the greatest challenges in pediatric critical care medicine. The diagnosis of pediatric severe sepsis is particularly challenging since it is time-critical and frequently must rely on clinician interpretation of an equivocal, non-specific, age-dependent constellation of clinical signs and symptoms that occur in association with an infection or other inciting events. Currently available EMR data screening tools designed to identify pediatric severe sepsis using consensus-based guidelines criteria have poor sensitivity/specificity and/or positive predictive value that can result in poor perceived usability. Recent studies show that, in general, sepsis CDS alert fatigue is common, either in the form of false positives or false negatives (e.g. alerting focused on the most severely ill with unequivocal signs of sepsis). As a result such tools are, at best, modestly clinically effective in improving early detection of unrecognized pediatric sepsis and, in infants, can result in antibiotic administration to large numbers of uninfected newborns. We believe significant improvement in CDS usability can only be achieved with a significant improvement in sensitivity/specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) operating at a clinician-specified level of risk. This will require alerting algorithms that leverage the combined analytic power of computerized semantic models (rules, natural language processing) embodied in consensus pediatric sepsis guidelines, pediatric critical care clinician expertise, and retrospective analytics over existing large repositories of clinical encounter data using machine learning algorithms. Late last year we were awarded a SBIR Phase 1 NIH research grant focused on the use of advanced ontological models combined with “big data” predictive analytics/machine learning (ML) techniques over ICU data as a foundation for an adult sepsis CDS. We demonstrated an AUC of 98% and PPV in excess of 85% for our sepsis detection tool for a patient sample of 15,811. We will leverage these results to establish exceptionally sensitive and specific tool that monitors PICU data to accurately predict pediatric patients at risk for impending acute clinical deterioration due to severe sepsis/septic shock. Our goal is to commercially deploy highly useable technology that achieves high levels of clinician acceptance and demonstrably influences timely treatment and pediatric patient outcomes. Our product development concept will employ human factors engineering to achieve highly synchronicity with clinical workflows, combined with a clinician-centered design of the interfaces between our CDS and the institutional pediatric sepsis protocols and EMR data sources. Our product vision is an early sepsis detection CDS with actionable accuracy and usability, compatible with any modern EMR in use at a client hospital, that is effective in reducing pediatric sepsis mortality in both critical and non-critical care settings. Even with the advent of powerful computer system technologies and modern antibiotics/antivirals used in hospitals, one-third of children who die in U.S. tertiary care pediatric intensive care units have severe sepsis. The goal of this research is to develop and validate a real-time pediatric severe sepsis surveillance software system that can be routinely used in conjunction with electronic medical record systems in hospitals to detect early stages of this syndrome. Our approach uses modern artificial intelligence techniques including cognitive reasoning, machine learning and natural language processing to dramatically reduce preventable mortality in hospitalized neonates and children.",Rule-based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Effective Clinical Decision Support (CDS): A Pediatric Severe Sepsis Case Study using ICU Data,9254171,R43GM122154,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Case Study', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysuria', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exanthema', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newborn Infant', 'Onset of illness', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Parents', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Units', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Premature Infant', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'adverse outcome', 'age related', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computerized', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'neonate', 'patient stratification', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'product development', 'prototype', 'repository', 'screening', 'software systems', 'symposium', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIGMS,"COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2017,147475,0.048649477126395536
"SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions}: According to the 2010 US census (http://www.census.gov/prod/2011 pubs/acsbr1 0-12. pdf) 2.8 million school-aged children (aged 5 to 17) suffer from some form of mental and/or physical disability. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) guarantees such children equal access to education. However, children aged 1 to 5, while even more in need of early rehabilitation therapy and social interaction, do not receive the same attention. This proposal describes a plan for developing a new paradigm for pediatric rehabilitation. The paradigm involves robots that interact socially with special needs children, within a closed feedback control loop. Its components include new methods for modeling and representation of children motion, visual activity recognition, machine learning and behavior adaptation, and general-sum game-theoretic analysis of human-robot interaction. The research groups in the two collaborating institutions, University of Delaware (UD) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), have produced preliminary results and evidence which suggest that the envisioned technical innovations in the domains mentioned above are feasible, and that physical implementation is possible.  There are three intertwined research thrusts in the proposed activity, that address specific long-standing challenges in each area: 1. pediatric rehabilitation: develop a robot-assisted, pediatric rehabilitation environment which combines motor training with social interaction; 2. computer vision and perception: develop interpretable perception and machine learning algorithms for adaptive activity recognition; 3. robot control: develop the control and coordination algorithms to enable directed and purposeful human-robot interaction. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Each year, 10 000 infants in the U.S. develop cerebral palsy and 4 000 infants have birth defects of the spine and the brain. The motor delays for these infants have lifelong consequences. This gap in mobility is a significant secondary impairment. We propose a new portable motor rehabilitation system with social robotic interfaces that maximizes rehabilitation dosage. The project will provide insights into motor development in special needs children suggesting a new early intervention paradigm for children with motor disabilities.",SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation,9348402,R01HD087133,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Dancing', 'Data', 'Delaware', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disabled Persons', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Feedback', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Perception', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Visual', 'aged', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cognitive disability', 'computer game', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'educational atmosphere', 'equipment training', 'human-robot interaction', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'motor rehabilitation', 'neuromuscular', 'peer', 'personalized medicine', 'physical therapist', 'portability', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'skeletal', 'social']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2017,477276,0.015573940714889479
"Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children Project Summary Access to diagnosis of autism and to invaluable early interventional therapy is severely hampered by the imbalance between the number of children needing care and the inadequate number of clinical practitioners who can deliver that care. This numerical imbalance is unlikely to change in the near future, and therefore there is an urgent need and an exciting opportunity to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers of children at risk for or with a diagnosis of autism, and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Using machine learning and large-scale data mining, we have built a mobile system to quantify and track the severity of autism that takes only minutes of a caregiver’s time and that has promise for repeat use at home due to its speed, accuracy and mobility. We have concomitantly developed a machine-learning system for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glass and delivers real time social cues to individuals with autism in that child’s natural environment. Our goal in this research program is to work with our clinical colleagues at Stanford’s Autism Center to test and refine these complementary machine-learning systems for accuracy and optimal use by families and their child with autism from their natural environments. We will then combine the two systems in a multi-month longitudinal trial designed to harness our mobilized machine learning tool to quantitatively measure the efficacy of our Autism Glasses as a therapeutic assistant that functions in real time and within the child’s natural environment. Our proposed experiments with at least 40 subjects at risk for developmental delay promise to demonstrate how to leverage digital health technologies to improve, mobilize and quicken the detection and treatment of autism. The work also will result in a new and unique dataset that validates the ability to bring the social learning process outside of the clinic and into the real world, leading to a faster, more fluid way for children with autism to gain social skills. We also expect our work to show how measurable indicators of behavioral improvement during therapy will facilitate the process of tracking progress on an increasingly more granular scale, and hopefully set the stage for more effective, precise and personalized treatment. Project Narrative There is a growing and striking imbalance between the number of clinical care providers and the number of children at risk for or managing an autism diagnosis, creating an urgent need to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Our research proposal is focused on building two complementary machine learning tools – one for rapid, mobile measurement of the autism phenotype and one for at-home social learning on Google Glasses – that we believe will open the diagnostic bottleneck and provide a valuable form of behavioral therapy that can be used at home and outside of the clinical setting.",Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children,9297669,R21HD091500,"['Address', 'Age', 'Android', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Therapeutics Program', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotions', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operating System', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Self-Direction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'care delivery', 'clinical care', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'handheld equipment', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intervention program', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'prototype', 'social', 'social learning', 'social skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'trial design']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,196250,-0.03323238632255933
"Nasal biomarkers of asthma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects 9.3% of children and 8.0% of adults in the US. Mild to moderate asthma can be difficult to diagnose and manage given waxing and waning symptoms. The airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation that underlie asthma are challenging to assess regularly and easily. Given the accessibility of the nose for assessment and monitoring, it is clinically and scientifically compelling to identify nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. To date, several lower airway pathogens have been associated with asthma. In separate studies, host gene expression in the airway has been associated with asthma. Host and microbes undoubtedly interact in asthma. A nasal biomarker that could accurately identify mild/moderate asthma and provide information on host vs. microbial contributions and their relative causality to disease would be highly useful for clinical care and research. We hypothesize that causal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma can be identified through network-based examination of nasal gene expression and microbiota. We will recruit subjects with mild/moderate asthma, severe asthma, and controls from whom we will generate the first paired system-wide profiles of host and microbiome in asthma. In Aim 1, we will focus on host characterization and identify nasal transcript biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma by RNA-sequence profiling of nasal brushings, differential gene expression analysis, and machine learning. In Aim 2, we will perform the first study of the nasal microbiome in asthma to identify nasal microbial biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. We will generate 16S rRNA data from nasal swabs to identify bacterial taxa associated with mild/moderate asthma, apply metagenomic inference to ascertain their functions, perform metagenomic sequencing for identification of non-bacterial taxa, and apply machine learning to distinguish microbial classifiers of mild/moderate asthma. We will be the first to reconstruct bacterial functions associated with asthma through metagenomic inference, and the first to apply metagenomic sequencing to well- characterized asthmatics. In Aim 3, we will identify causal nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma through data-driven, network approaches that integrate genetic, transcriptome, microbiome, and clinical data. We will link host to microbiome by constructing interaction networks, characterize the association between genetic variation and gene expression by eQTL detection, and infer causal drivers of mild/moderate asthma through Bayesian network construction. We will project asthma-specific subnetworks onto our networks, and compare our networks to those for other respiratory diseases to identify coherent modules of genes and microbes dysregulated in asthma. In all aims, we will assess for relevance to asthma more broadly by testing for the identified biomarkers in nasal and bronchial samples from severe asthmatics. We expect that our results will lead to the development of a nasal test that can be used for the clinical management and investigation of mild/moderate asthma, a prevalent disease that is currently suboptimally diagnosed and managed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma impairs quality of life and leads to emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and sometimes death in people of all ages and walks of life. To identify noninvasive, predictive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we will comprehensively profile and examine nasal gene expression and the nasal microbial community in subjects with mild/moderate and severe asthma. We will use computational biology to construct networks that reflect the interactions and interconnectivity of host and microbes in asthma, and identify nasal biomarker candidates that we expect will lead to a nasal test for asthma.",Nasal biomarkers of asthma,9259911,R01AI118833,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Network-based', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Sequences', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Waxes', 'airway inflammation', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'bronchial epithelium', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'epidemiologic data', 'forest', 'fungus', 'genetic analysis', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'pathogen', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus identification']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,841388,0.09796373503614768
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design. The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis. ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",9239711,R01HD087363,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergent care', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data registry', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electronic registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient registry', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'support tools', 'wasting']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,735263,0.02067065845989951
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9283910,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2017,544529,0.021643949912048356
"Perinatal Origins of Asthma Project Abstract  Early in life many children develop wheezing which can be a sign of early-onset asthma. Yet, not all children who experience wheezing episodes develop asthma. Predicting asthma that begins early in life is important as those who develop early-onset asthma are more likely to have persistent symptoms and structural changes to the lung. Identification and early intervention of high risk individuals could prevent long term lung function abnormalities and provide an alternative to costly treatment. To date, risk prediction models for early- onset asthma are limited mainly to clinical history and presentation. Additionally, no one model contains both reliable sensitivity and specificity or clinically valid serological predictors for early-onset asthma.  Our laboratory has focused previously on immunologic responses to common asthmatic triggers, house dust mite (HMD) and cockroach allergens, between individuals and how these responses differ between populations and outcomes. We have identified increased lymphoproliferation and cytokine response (IL-13) in allergen-stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) derived from individuals who are atopic or African- Americans. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan, stimulate the cytokine production of IL-13 and IFN-γ. In this proposal our preliminary data indicate that the production of IL-13 after allergen exposure in CBMCs is associated with exposure to different microbiota. In addition, early exposure to Moraxellaceae greatly enhances IL-13 production by CBMCs after exposure to HDM. Taken together, our data suggest that early-life bacterial exposure may enhance the production of cytokines that can alter host physiology and immunity.  In this translational medicine proposal, we will build a predictive model for early-onset asthma that will be applicable to general and high risk populations. Our approach will include high-throughput techniques to assess bacterial exposure and immunologic response in the perinatal time period. We will integrate the large amount of data generated into a pipeline with machine learning algorithms that will be regulated specifically for the prediction of later onset of disease. In addition, we will assess bacterial exposure in association with mothers who carry risks for asthma development in their children. The proposed studies will address both the need of predictive model for early-onset asthma and identify bacterial-host interactions associated with high risk populations (e.g. maternal risk factors). Together, these studies form the platform for multidisciplinary training in microbe- immune interactions, predictive risk for asthma, bioinformatics and form a solid foundation to launch a successful career as a physician- scientist. Project Narrative Asthma is the most common chronic disorder of childhood. Early-onset asthma, if left untreated, leads to long term respiratory dysfunction, and currently, no clinical tools reliably aid in prediction of asthma. Therefore, this proposal aims to develop a predictive model for asthma involving microbial and immune interactions that will be applicable to the general and high risk populations.",Perinatal Origins of Asthma,9395534,F30HL136001,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic rhinitis', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Bacterial DNA', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dictyoptera', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemophilus', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Interferon Type II', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mononuclear', 'Moraxella', 'Moraxellaceae', 'Mothers', 'Obesity', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Peptidoglycan', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Pyroglyphidae', 'Recording of previous events', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Smoking', 'Solid', 'Streptococcus', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States', 'Wheezing', 'airway remodeling', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'career', 'cockroach allergen', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiota', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'persistent symptom', 'predictive modeling', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'respiratory health', 'response', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F30,2017,49044,0.08854984363204584
"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,9216965,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,388615,-0.029573390187382777
"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,9311704,R01MH104030,"['Advertisements', 'Age', 'Anniversary', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'brain abnormalities', 'caudate nucleus', 'comparison group', 'critical period', 'dexterity', 'follow-up', 'habit learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical attention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomenological models', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'secondary analysis', 'vector']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,721638,0.026603378336026936
"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining longitudinal multimodal brain imaging and high- dimensional behavioral assessments in school-age children together with sophisticated data analytic techniques to increase precision when linking heterogeneous ECAs and child outcome with the goal of predicting mental health outcomes and identifying children who would benefit most from specific early interventions.  ",Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities,9384268,R01MH091864,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Orphanages', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Violence', 'Visit', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'caregiving', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'foster care', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'middle childhood', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prepuberty', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'sex', 'socioeconomics']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2017,782745,0.035373138290661195
"Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data, Modeling, and Coordination Center (DMCC) for the NHLBI's Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network. The objective of PrecISE is to conduct sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials with precision interventions in stratified patient with severe asthma populations. Patients with severe asthma are heterogeneous, and thus a hard to treat population. Precision medicine interventions, which focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients instead of the best treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this complex patient population. The PrecISE Network is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating Clinical Center investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for PrecISE trials. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include PrecISE information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other key features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to PrecISE by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the PrecISE Network. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for the execution of high-impact, sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials in the PrecISE Network, which can lead to the establishment of potential personalized treatment approaches for patients with severe and/or exacerbation-prone asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe asthma affects 10% of people worldwide, and despite currently available treatments, asthma remains poorly controlled for many patients. The National Institutes of Health is funding a new iteration of previous high- impact asthma clinical trials networks, which will take a personalized medicine approach to identify new therapies for severe asthma, tailored to an individual patient using data-based treatment algorithms that leverage information on his/her individual disease and treatment history. Our proposal is to provide leadership and statistical research support to this network.","Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network",9404235,U24HL138998,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Calendar', 'Case Report Form', 'Certification', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Files', 'Data Reporting', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Gills', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Online Systems', 'Operations Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Writing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'material transfer agreement', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2017,991019,0.04675424901581135
"Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is defined as a severe infection with dangerous physiologic changes, organ dysfunction or death, which hospitalizes over 1.6 million people in the U.S. annually. Sepsis is a priority for the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services due to its healthcare impact, incidence and staggering annual cost, which exceed $20 billion and 5% of all U.S. hospital costs. All sepsis patients, even those with mild sepsis are at risk for in- hospital complications and death, but have improved outcomes if identified early. Sepsis recognition, however, is challenging due to the heterogeneity of patients who may manifest a wide array of clinical presentations. Electronic medical record (EMR) linked computer programs, known as clinical decision support (CDS) tools, have become ubiquitous to assist providers, including identifying sepsis patients. Unfortunately, all CDS tools in the literature miss 20-30% of sepsis patients and frequently misidentify non-sepsis patients as sepsis patients. Inaccurate CDS tools generate far too many false positive alerts, creating the dangerous condition of “alert fatigue” in which providers become habituated to all alerts, threatening patient safety and even leading to fatal consequences.  The PI and Co-I of this proposal collaboratively developed a CDS software called Sepsis-Alert for adult emergency department (ED) patients. It was fully implemented into Detroit Medical Center's (DMC) EMR live environment and has now been continually operational to provide real-time ongoing monitoring of all ED patients at Sinai Grace Hospital of DMC since October 2014. Our analysis of 25,000 ED visits reveals that while Sepsis-Alert's performance exceeds any reported performance, it still remains unacceptably inaccurate. All the CDS tools, including ours, have two limitations: (1) they lack a mechanism to learn from their past erroneous decisions and consequently repeat the same mistakes again and again, and (2) their decision- making process is fixed and treats all patients in the same way even in face of high heterogeneity of patients,  The main thrust of this research project is to develop an innovative prototype CDS software that functions like Sepsis-Alert but without the two limitations for the same ED sepsis screening purpose. We will develop the software system by utilizing data extracted from the EMR and will test and fine tune the system in over 35,000 retrospective and prospective patients at Sinai Grace Hospital. The proposed prototype, Intelligent Sepsis Alert, will have the cutting edge capabilities of recognizing the subtleties of sepsis, categorizing patients and learning from its own mistakes to avoid repeat them. CDS tools of the future can and must be better. Machine learning is the solution to optimizing patient care without creating a harmful environment. The final deliverable of this project will be a highly accurate and advanced program readily adoptable by any health system or hospital to improve sepsis care and create a safer healthcare environment. 1 Project Narrative  Sepsis is a toxic response to a severe infection and represents a healthcare epidemic, which afflicts millions of people and accounts for 5% of all hospital costs and over $20 billion in the U.S. annually. This project's objective is to develop a cutting edge computer based tool, called Intelligent Sepsis Alert, with the power of machine intelligence (a form of artificial intelligence) and the ability to learn that will accurately identify sepsis patients for healthcare providers extremely early in their hospital course to ensure that patients receive all of the necessary life-saving interventions they need. Intelligent Sepsis Alert will be readily adoptable by other hospitals and health systems and by providing the critical real-time, bedside support for early sepsis identification will translate into multitudes of deaths prevented, abundant intensive care unit admissions avoided, hundreds of thousands of dollars saved and thousands of wasted nursing and physician man-hours eliminated.",Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning,9280871,R21HS024750,[' '],AHRQ,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,149851,0.018571270286194905
"Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome disease in the United States. Despite this, epidemiologic investigations into childhood asthma are limited by variations in asthma diagnosis across sites and inefficient utilization of electronic medical records (EMRs) to facilitate large- scale studies. Algorithms based on structured data (e.g., ICD-9 codes) have shown strong specificity, but lack the sensitivity required for population-based studies for asthma. Manual EMR reviews allow application of well- recognized criteria-based definitions such as the Asthma Predictive Index (API) or the Predetermined Asthma Criteria (PAC), but are labor-intensive and expensive, and therefore not feasible for population-level studies. Because of the lack of consistent, reproducible, and efficient asthma ascertainment methods, the use of inconsistent a. asthma criteria, b. ascertainment processes, and c. sampling frames results in inconsistent asthma cohorts and study results for clinical trials or other studies. This inconsistency causes confusion, delayed translation of important study findings into clinical practice, and may obscure the true heterogeneity of asthma. Our long-term goal is to advance research and clinical care for asthma, by developing a robust software tool to streamline the process of automatic medical record ascertainment of asthma based on the asthma criteria (PAC and API). We propose to augment traditional structured data criteria with natural language processing (NLP) techniques to account for unstructured text. Thus, the main goal of this proposal is to develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for automating API, and apply the NLP algorithms for both PAC and API to identify a cohort of children with asthma. In addition, we will use the tools to characterize children with asthma thereby demonstrating its usefulness in epidemiological investigations and also possibly in asthma management. We hypothesize that asthma criteria-based NLP algorithms applied to the EMR will allow us to identify and characterize asthma status accurately, consistently, and efficiently. In Aim 1, we will develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for API. In Aim 2, we will apply both NLP-API (developed under Aim 1) and NLP-PAC (our recently developed PAC-based NLP algorithm) to two evaluation cohorts. In Aim 3, we will characterize the subgroups of children with asthma identified under Aim 2 by assessing the association of NLP-ascertained asthma status with lung function and biomarkers for asthma. The expected outcomes of the proposed study are: (i) enhanced research capabilities for asthma by enabling more consistent, reproducible, and efficient large-scale asthma ascertainment, sampling frames, and timing estimations; (ii) a basis for improving timely asthma diagnosis and care through clinical decision support systems; and (iii) advancement of the use of NLP techniques for clinical studies. Successful completion of this project will provide an accurate, consistent, and efficient tool for addressing the significant burden of asthma in children and a framework for extension to other chronic diseases and adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome diseases in the United States. However, conducting research on and developing quality improvement initiatives around asthma management at the population level is difficult, primarily due to the inconsistent identification of who has asthma and who doesn't. Identification of asthma status from review of medical records is very time consuming and expensive. Thus, researchers and clinicians often use more easily available but potentially inconsistent ways to determine asthma status, such as review of diagnostic billing codes. This results in varied cohorts of people defined as having asthma that are associated with inconsistent study outcomes in asthma such as risk of asthma or asthma control. We will use natural language processing, a computer based search of electronic medical records (clinical notes), to efficiently determine who has asthma, what kind of asthma, and the onset of recognizable asthma symptoms that identify asthma efficiently, accurately, and consistently. An algorithm that robustly ascertains the status of asthma, and by extension possibly other chronic diseases, will accelerate scientific discoveries on asthma, enhance translation of research findings into clinical practice, and ultimately improve patient care.",Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records,9246341,R01HL126667,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'ICD-9', 'Information Centers', 'Information Retrieval', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Laboratories', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence based guidelines', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'longitudinal dataset', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2017,377370,0.10701432351383669
"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5  percent of school-­aged children in the US. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of children with FASD and their  families can access FASD-­informed interventions due to significant systems-­ and family-­level barriers.  Research suggests that self-­directed and peer-­to-­peer interventions are acceptable to families and can lead to  significant improvements in parenting, child behavior, and resource utilization. Advancements in technology  are facilitating more accessible and interactive methods for self-­directed education and support. The proposed  project will develop and evaluate the efficacy of a novel mobile health (mHealth) application (“app”) to directly  provide caregivers with evidence-­based content and peer-­moderated support they can easily access and use  to improve outcomes for their children and families. The app, currently called “FMF Connect,” will be derived  from the scientifically-­validated Families Moving Forward (FMF) Program and will build on existing frameworks  for the development of medical apps. This project will follow a systematic approach to the development and  evaluation of the FMF Connect mHealth intervention, including a small-­scale feasibility trial (n=30), and a  larger-­scale hybrid implementation-­effectiveness trial (n=120) with caregivers raising children (ages 3-­12) with  FASD. Implementation data will aid in identifying the patterns of app usage that relate to the greatest  improvements in child and caregiver outcomes. Study hypotheses are: 1) that caregivers will find the FMF  Connect intervention acceptable, with easy to access content and encouraging support from peer-­moderators;;  2) that greater usage of specific intervention components will relate to larger improvements in child and  caregiver outcomes;; 3) that caregivers who receive the FMF Connect intervention will have larger gains on  child and caregiver outcomes relative to a waitlist comparison group;; and 4) that an increase in  neurodevelopmental attributions for behavior will mediate intervention-­related improvements in parenting  efficacy and child behavior. Project findings will guide further app development both in terms of content and  technological advances to optimize intervention effects. Results of this study will further the overall strategic  aims of the Collaborative Initiative on FASD (CIFASD), which are to inform and develop effective interventions

"Early understanding of multi-digit numbers Place value concepts and multi-digit numbers are the foundations of mathematics; however, many  children struggle at acquiring this knowledge. Poor understanding of the place value concepts has  been linked to difficulties in mathematics learning through the elementary and middle school  grades, and it is present not only for children with learning disabilities but also for a large  proportion of normally developing children. It is, thus, important to understand the developmental  mechanisms of multi-digit number learning and potential sources of early experiences that allow  some children to readily grasp the concepts while others continue to struggle. Recent research on place value concepts has suggested that children have partial knowledge of  multi-digit numbers at the preschool period, before receiving formal training from schools. These  precursors of multi-digit number knowledge can serve as important stepping-stones for children to  master the concept of place value once entering schools. However, there are at least two gaps in  our current understanding of the development  of place value concepts. First, how does early  understanding of multi-digit numbers relate to formal school training of the place value concepts?  Second, how do children come to acquire partial knowledge of multi-digit numbers at such a young  age in the first place? The goal of the proposed research aims at filling these gaps in the  literature with three specific aims. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that early knowledge of multi-digit  numbers is predictive of later school learning of the place value concepts. I propose to conduct a  3-year longitudinal study to measure children’s early understanding of multi-digit numbers at the  start and end of kindergarten, 1st  and 2nd grades. The study will test how early knowledge of  number names and written numerals, as well as other individual difference measurements (e.g., age,  gender, SES, number sense, home exposures to numbers),  relate to the learning of base-10  principles in grade school. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that acquiring early knowledge of  multi-digit numbers is a form of statistical learning, during which children extract latent  structures that govern the mapping between number words and written numerals through sparse  co-occurrence data. A training study is designed to give children casual experiences with  multi-digit numbers in engaging and child- friendly activities (e.g., picture-book reading, ipad  games). The same children in the statistical learning training will also be given formal school  training afterward, allowing us to assess and provide causal evidence for the hypothesis that early  knowledge prepares children for formal school training of the place value concepts. The knowledge  gained from this research will have implications for: a) determining the role of early knowledge of  multi-digit numbers in preparing children to learn about base-10 notation at schools; b) linking  statistical learning from sparse co-occurrence data about number words and multi-digit numbers to  early partial knowledge of place value; c) documenting how differences in early learning  environment (or input) may contribute to developmental inequalities in later school performances. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims at understanding the early development of multi-digit numbers, its learning mechanisms and its impact on formal school training of place value concepts. The period of development studied here, from 3 to 5 years of age, is a period during which sizable individual differences in multi-digit number knowledge starts to emerge, which may contribute to early developmental inequalities that limit the development of some children even after entering school. The proposed work is relevant to public health in that it will shed light on how differences in early learning environment lead to individual differences in early understanding of multi-digit numbers, potentially serving as the foundation for future early mathematical training programs.",Early understanding of multi-digit numbers,9394832,F32HD090827,"['5 year old', '6 year old', 'Age', 'Books', 'Child', 'Consequentialism', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Digit structure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inequality', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Names', 'Nursery Schools', 'Only Child', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preschool Child', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'early experience', 'educational atmosphere', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first grade', 'formal learning', 'grasp', 'junior high school', 'kindergarten', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematics disability', 'second grade', 'socioeconomics', 'success']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F32,2017,56694,-0.009172398553991113
"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9327032,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'ROC Curve', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'Treatment outcome', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2017,757906,0.025287160055924133
"Technology and Parent-Child Interaction PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Radesky is a board-certified Developmental Behavioral Pediatrician whose prior research and clinical work has focused on the importance of early childhood experiences in shaping long-term developmental and behavioral outcomes, particularly in low-income children. Her research has examined how digital media – including television and mobile devices such as smartphones – interacts with the early-parent child relationship, both being shaped by, and shaping, parenting behaviors and child social-emotional development. This mentored career development award will allow her to learn additional methodologies for assessing parent- child interaction and mobile device usage by parents. She has identified a comprehensive, trans-disciplinary mentoring team at the University of Michigan Departments of Pediatrics, Health Behavior and Health Education, Psychiatry, Psychology, Communications, and Informatics, as well as the Center for Human Growth and Development, to provide methodological and content expertise, including: Julie Lumeng, MD; Alison Miller, PhD; Katherine Rosenblum, PhD; Scott W. Campbell, PhD; and Mark Newman, PhD. This team of mentors and advisors will help guide her towards the following Training and Career Goals: 1. Develop working knowledge of theoretical models of parent-child interaction 2. Develop skills in using mobile devices to collect usage data and ecologic momentary assessment of parent  emotional states 3. Develop skills in research methods to assess parent-child interaction, including:  a) Behavioral coding of parent-child interaction from videotape  b) Language Environment Analysis (LENA) audiorecording to measure parent-child verbal interaction 4. Learn statistical analytic techniques unique to assessing parent-child interaction 5. Develop familiarity with the field of information science/human-computer interaction to inform future studies. Healthy social-emotional development in young children relies on sensitive, responsive parent-child interactions, particularly in children growing up in adversity. Screen media use is a highly prevalent behavior that may be a modifiable barrier to responsive parent-child interactions. Despite rapid increases in the use of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) by families with young children, there is a paucity of research examining associations between mobile device use and parent-child interactions. This research plan focuses on testing a conceptual model that parent and child traits predict how parents use mobile devices during family activities, and that certain features of this device use (particularly their emotional response to it) predict changes in parent-child interaction. This model also examines temporal contingencies in parent-child interaction and mobile device use, in order to help clarify directionality. This conceptual model will be tested through 3 Specific Aims: Aim 1) Test the hypotheses that parent depressive symptoms, lower parenting self-efficacy, higher parenting stress, and child difficult temperament and lower child emotion regulation are associated with higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use. Aim 2) Test the hypotheses that higher frequency, longer duration, and more negative parent emotional response to parent mobile device use are associated with less parent-child verbal exchange, lower parental responsivity, more parent-child conflict, and lower parent ability to read child behavioral cues. Aim 3) Determine whether changes in parent-child interaction (changes in parent and child affect, verbal exchange, parent responsivity, parent-child conflict, or parent ability to read child behavioral cues) occur before or after parent mobile device use. These Specific Aims will be carried out in two complementary cohorts: A) 296 low-income mother-child dyads enrolled in an existing cohort study with previously collected videotapes of home mealtimes, during which mobile devices are commonly used; and B) 100 parent-child dyads from a range of socioeconomic status backgrounds who will be followed for 4 days of data collection with continuous mobile device-based passive sensing of the parent's mobile device use, coordinated with simultaneous audiorecording of parent-child interaction using Language Environment Analysis (LENA) technology. Future Implications: The results from this work will contribute to an evidence base about how families can use the explosion of new media in their households in the healthiest ways possible, both through the formation of clinical guidelines and future interventional approaches. PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Despite the rapidly increasing ownership and use of mobile technology by parents and evidence showing that older technologies such as television displace important parent-child interactions, remarkably little research has examined the effects of mobile device use on families. This proposal examines which parent-child dyads are at highest risk of disturbances in parent-child interaction from mobile devices, how parent mobile device use precedes or follows changes in parent-child interactions, and the behavioral mechanisms underlying these associations.

"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate. In this application, we propose to develop and assess the validity of an in-home objective, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system, called FLASH that has the potential to revolutionize the measurement of screen use behaviors.",Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH,9288252,R01DK113269,"['10 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'Asses', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child health care', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral outcome', 'college', 'cost', 'diaries', 'field study', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'tv watching', 'validation studies']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,450361,-0.018679757357099928
"Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED) PROJECT SUMMARY In this application, I am requesting support from a career development award to support my research proposal titled “Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction”. I will be undertaking this work with the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Gordon (Primary US mentor) at the Washington University, St Louis and Dr. Asad Ali (Primary LMIC mentor) at the Aga Khan University. This project builds on our existing studies of Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED), funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The current application aims to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of EED by studying the evolution of gut microbial configuration in children who have clinical and histological evidence of EED. EED is common in children living in impoverished conditions with limited access to clean drinking water and sanitation. Histopathological changes of EED in small bowel mucosa include alteration in crypt to villous ratio along with lymphocytic infiltration of the villous epithelium and lamina propria. Although studies involving biopsies of small bowel mucosa are critical to study EED, these studies are uncommon because of logistic challenges involving performing endoscopies in field settings in LMICs. We have previously demonstrated in an ongoing BMGF funded study that we are able to safely obtain such biopsies, we now have a unique opportunity to study the relationship between gut microbiome evolution and EED in this cohort. The central hypothesis of the current application is that children with histological confirmation of EED have shared features of a bacterial community which is different from healthy controls and non-EED subjects, and that such changes in bacterial configuration are associated with enteric and systemic inflammation. For testing these hypotheses, evaluation of gut microbiome in healthy and stunted children will be carried out to identify the age discriminatory bacterial taxa in children with and without confirmation of EED. Dr. Gordon will be providing mentorship and experience in gut microbiome and microbiota analysis. Dr. Ali will provide the needed infrastructure of the field site and laboratory facilities, along with linking the microbiome analysis with clinical and histological outcomes of interest. The Aga Khan University is a leading regional research institute with multiple support systems for junior investigators which will be vital for my career transition as an independent scientist. My long term goal is to be the principal investigator of my own laboratory, focusing on studying the gut microbiome and its relationship with communicable and non-communicable diseases. I envision working on microbiota derived therapy for EED, and to find targets in the inflammatory pathways driven by changes in gut homeostasis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Globally, Pakistan has the third highest rate of stunting among children aged < 5 years. Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) is proposed to be a critical factor responsible for chronic growth faltering in children in resource limited settings. This research utilizes an innovative approach to study a program of postnatal gut microbiome development in children and its impact on child growth. This proposal will provide an ideal training platform for a translational scientist, covering the domains of mucosal immunology, histopathology, computational analysis, microbiome analysis and host immune responses. The skills learnt from this project will be critical for the capacity development of both the LMIC institution and the candidate herself.","Microbiota, Inflammation and Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (MiEED)",9402123,K43TW010697,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Duodenum', 'Endoscopy', 'Enteral', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Height', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Homeostasis', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lamina Propria', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Small Intestines', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Sustainable Development', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Villous', 'Washington', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'drinking water', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'forest', 'global health', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'immune activation', 'immune function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intestinal villi', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'skills', 'translational scientist']",FIC,AGA KHAN UNIVERSITY (PAKISTAN),K43,2017,57663,0.026634725756415935
"SCH: kHealth: Semantic Multisensory Mobile Approach to Personalized Asthma Care ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The proliferation of smartphones and sensors has made continuous monitoring of physiology, environment, and public health notifications possible. However, personalized digital health and patient empowerment will become reality only if massive multisensory and multimodal observational data is processed within patient context and made actionable to enable early detection; better diagnosis, effective prevention and treatment of the disease; and improve the quality of life. This research will be performed in the context of asthma, which affects 300 million people and claims over 250,000 lives worldwide annually. According to CDC, 9.3% of US children have asthma. Understanding asthma and its management is challenging; it is a multifactorial disease with subjective causes and symptoms, and extant diagnosis and treatment guidelines can be improved using evidence-based action recommendation. With the advent of mobile and connected sensors, timely information about asthma triggers has become available, and its exploitation requires precisely understanding and quantifying the sensed data's role for preventive and proactive assessment of asthma. In this application led by computer scientists and a practicing clinician, we address the central problem of deriving actionable information from data monitored using kHealth technology. Through a pilot study, we have tested our kHealth kit equipped on several pediatric patients under the guidance of a clinical doctor for reliable data collection and patient operation, with promising initial results. We build on this foundation by addressing the problem of semantic representation, integration, abstraction, and personalized interpretation of heterogeneous observations spanning physiological, environmental data, and online data in the context of medical knowledge. Our primary hypothesis is that an evidence-based approach to asthma can help doctors determine more precisely the cause, severity and control of asthma, and can alert patients to seek timely clinical assistance to better manage asthma. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This application direclty relates to NICHD mission of improving health of children, with focus on asthma that affects a significant population.

"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,9349480,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA analysis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gene complementation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,619708,0.01726785952632485
"Enhanced Ascertainment of Asthma Status Via Natural Language Processing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that almost one-half of Americans suffer from chronic diseases, yet epidemiologic investigations are limited by the difficulty of ascertaining disease status at scale, even in the era of electronic medical records (EMRs). For example, algorithms based on structured data (e.g., ICD-9 codes) for asthma lack the sensitivity required for population-based studies, while manual medical record reviews of EMRs are labor-intensive and thus inefficient for population-scale ascertainment of disease status. The lack of efficient ways to ascertain disease status has severely restricted the scope of investigation for chronic diseases such as asthma. Furthermore, there is a temporal progression of a patient's true disease status, and this may not be reflected in the clinical diagnosis of that disease. We previously reported that two-thirds of children with asthma had a delay in their diagnosis (median: 3.3 years), with subsequent conditions like remission or relapse largely unreported. Such information about disease progression may be recorded during manual medical record review, but, again, manual review limits investigations and conclusions to small-scale studies. Our long term goal is to accelerate epidemiological investigations of chronic diseases and their temporal progression by streamlining medical record review. The main goal of this proposal is to extend a preliminary NLP-based system for asthma status ascertainment by identifying time-situated classifications of asthma onset, remission, and relapse. We will validate this system in a population health setting and release it as an open-source tool. We hypothesize that NLP methods in the EMR allow us to ascertain asthma status and to track asthma disease progression with greater accuracy and efficiency than conventional approaches (billing codes or manual medical record review). In Aim 1, we will extend our preliminary NLP system to ascertain the patient-level disease progression of asthma. Most significantly, we will ascertain time-situated asthma remission and relapse, two important events in the natural history of asthma. We will also improve methods of aggregating events, employ temporal expression and relation extraction, include structured data sources, and implement automatic feature selection. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the NLP system for its accuracy in ascertaining asthma onset, relapse, and remission. We will also verify the epidemiological (construct) validity against existing studies, and disseminate the NLP system as an open-source project, Adept (Aggregation of Disease Evidence for Patient Timelines). Expected Outcomes: The proposed NLP system will: (i) orient clinical NLP techniques toward time-situated patient-level solutions; (ii) expand the scale of research capabilities for asthma; and (iii) provide a basis for decision support and other applications. Successful completion of this project would provide an open-source tool for ascertaining the disease progression of asthma with a general approach to aggregating evidence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children, yet studying asthma in large populations is difficult because it is costly to read through medical records to determine who has asthma and when they got it. We aim to use electronic medical records (especially clinical notes) to efficiently determine who has asthma and track its progression over time. An algorithm that tracks disease status over time will potentially enable further research on chronic diseases, and will ultimately improve patient care.",Enhanced Ascertainment of Asthma Status Via Natural Language Processing,8995191,R21AI116839,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'ICD-9', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'open source', 'population based', 'population health', 'response', 'tool']",NIAID,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2016,238500,0.0423730668154882
"SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions}: According to the 2010 US census (http://www.census.gov/prod/2011 pubs/acsbr1 0-12. pdf) 2.8 million school-aged children (aged 5 to 17) suffer from some form of mental and/or physical disability. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) guarantees such children equal access to education. However, children aged 1 to 5, while even more in need of early rehabilitation therapy and social interaction, do not receive the same attention. This proposal describes a plan for developing a new paradigm for pediatric rehabilitation. The paradigm involves robots that interact socially with special needs children, within a closed feedback control loop. Its components include new methods for modeling and representation of children motion, visual activity recognition, machine learning and behavior adaptation, and general-sum game-theoretic analysis of human-robot interaction. The research groups in the two collaborating institutions, University of Delaware (UD) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), have produced preliminary results and evidence which suggest that the envisioned technical innovations in the domains mentioned above are feasible, and that physical implementation is possible.  There are three intertwined research thrusts in the proposed activity, that address specific long-standing challenges in each area: 1. pediatric rehabilitation: develop a robot-assisted, pediatric rehabilitation environment which combines motor training with social interaction; 2. computer vision and perception: develop interpretable perception and machine learning algorithms for adaptive activity recognition; 3. robot control: develop the control and coordination algorithms to enable directed and purposeful human-robot interaction. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Each year, 10 000 infants in the U.S. develop cerebral palsy and 4 000 infants have birth defects of the spine and the brain. The motor delays for these infants have lifelong consequences. This gap in mobility is a significant secondary impairment. We propose a new portable motor rehabilitation system with social robotic interfaces that maximizes rehabilitation dosage. The project will provide insights into motor development in special needs children suggesting a new early intervention paradigm for children with motor disabilities.",SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation,9146176,R01HD087133,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Dancing', 'Data', 'Delaware', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Feedback', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Perception', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Visual', 'Visual Motion', 'Weight', 'aged', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cognitive disability', 'computer game', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'educational atmosphere', 'equipment training', 'human-robot interaction', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'learned behavior', 'meetings', 'motor rehabilitation', 'neuromuscular', 'peer', 'personalized medicine', 'physical therapist', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'skeletal', 'social', 'technology training']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2016,477724,0.015573940714889479
"Nasal biomarkers of asthma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects 9.3% of children and 8.0% of adults in the US. Mild to moderate asthma can be difficult to diagnose and manage given waxing and waning symptoms. The airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation that underlie asthma are challenging to assess regularly and easily. Given the accessibility of the nose for assessment and monitoring, it is clinically and scientifically compelling to identify nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. To date, several lower airway pathogens have been associated with asthma. In separate studies, host gene expression in the airway has been associated with asthma. Host and microbes undoubtedly interact in asthma. A nasal biomarker that could accurately identify mild/moderate asthma and provide information on host vs. microbial contributions and their relative causality to disease would be highly useful for clinical care and research. We hypothesize that causal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma can be identified through network-based examination of nasal gene expression and microbiota. We will recruit subjects with mild/moderate asthma, severe asthma, and controls from whom we will generate the first paired system-wide profiles of host and microbiome in asthma. In Aim 1, we will focus on host characterization and identify nasal transcript biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma by RNA-sequence profiling of nasal brushings, differential gene expression analysis, and machine learning. In Aim 2, we will perform the first study of the nasal microbiome in asthma to identify nasal microbial biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. We will generate 16S rRNA data from nasal swabs to identify bacterial taxa associated with mild/moderate asthma, apply metagenomic inference to ascertain their functions, perform metagenomic sequencing for identification of non-bacterial taxa, and apply machine learning to distinguish microbial classifiers of mild/moderate asthma. We will be the first to reconstruct bacterial functions associated with asthma through metagenomic inference, and the first to apply metagenomic sequencing to well- characterized asthmatics. In Aim 3, we will identify causal nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma through data-driven, network approaches that integrate genetic, transcriptome, microbiome, and clinical data. We will link host to microbiome by constructing interaction networks, characterize the association between genetic variation and gene expression by eQTL detection, and infer causal drivers of mild/moderate asthma through Bayesian network construction. We will project asthma-specific subnetworks onto our networks, and compare our networks to those for other respiratory diseases to identify coherent modules of genes and microbes dysregulated in asthma. In all aims, we will assess for relevance to asthma more broadly by testing for the identified biomarkers in nasal and bronchial samples from severe asthmatics. We expect that our results will lead to the development of a nasal test that can be used for the clinical management and investigation of mild/moderate asthma, a prevalent disease that is currently suboptimally diagnosed and managed.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma impairs quality of life and leads to emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and sometimes death in people of all ages and walks of life.

We will use computational biology to construct networks that reflect the interactions and interconnectivity of host and microbes in asthma, and identify nasal biomarker candidates that we expect will lead to a nasal test for asthma.            ",Nasal biomarkers of asthma,9062381,R01AI118833,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Network-based', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Sequences', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Waxes', 'airway inflammation', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'bronchial epithelium', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'epidemiologic data', 'forest', 'fungus', 'genetic analysis', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'pathogen', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus identification']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2016,819475,0.09796373503614768
"Nasal biomarkers of asthma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects 9.3% of children and 8.0% of adults in the US. Mild to moderate asthma can be difficult to diagnose and manage given waxing and waning symptoms. The airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation that underlie asthma are challenging to assess regularly and easily. Given the accessibility of the nose for assessment and monitoring, it is clinically and scientifically compelling to identify nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. To date, several lower airway pathogens have been associated with asthma. In separate studies, host gene expression in the airway has been associated with asthma. Host and microbes undoubtedly interact in asthma. A nasal biomarker that could accurately identify mild/moderate asthma and provide information on host vs. microbial contributions and their relative causality to disease would be highly useful for clinical care and research. We hypothesize that causal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma can be identified through network-based examination of nasal gene expression and microbiota. We will recruit subjects with mild/moderate asthma, severe asthma, and controls from whom we will generate the first paired system-wide profiles of host and microbiome in asthma. In Aim 1, we will focus on host characterization and identify nasal transcript biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma by RNA-sequence profiling of nasal brushings, differential gene expression analysis, and machine learning. In Aim 2, we will perform the first study of the nasal microbiome in asthma to identify nasal microbial biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. We will generate 16S rRNA data from nasal swabs to identify bacterial taxa associated with mild/moderate asthma, apply metagenomic inference to ascertain their functions, perform metagenomic sequencing for identification of non-bacterial taxa, and apply machine learning to distinguish microbial classifiers of mild/moderate asthma.

"PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH NEW-ONSET TICS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders are often debilitating and are increasing in prevalence. Tourette Syndrome/Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD), we propose, has a course that lends itself especially well to discovering optimal strategies for early diagnosis and prevention of developmental disorders. Common clinical practice and epidemiological data suggest that a large fraction (10-25%) of all children manifest motor and/or vocal tics at some age. Yet only 1-3% of all children have tics for the full year required for diagnosis of TS/CTD. The objective of the proposed research is to understand the structural and functional neuroimaging features of children with new-onset tics (""New Tics""), as the neurobiology of this population has not been investigated. Studying children with New Tics should provide the most leverage in understanding why tics remit in some children but not others. This proposal compares neuroimaging features of New Tics to TS/CTD and to controls, implements machine-learning tools to predict whether children with New Tics will remit or develop TS/CTD, and utilizes longitudinal scans to identify within-subject changes that occur as tics remit or persist.  The proposed study will apply resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs fcMRI) and structural MRI methods to investigate children with New Tics. Neuroimaging will be conducted on children with current, new- onset tics, and comparisons will be made to existing MRI data from children with diagnosed TS/CTD and controls. Follow-up evaluation (1 year after tic onset) of New Tics will allow us to identify which children's tics remitted completely and whic were actually in the earliest stages of TS/CTD, thus sorting this group into Remitted Tics and Converted TS/CTD subgroups. Based on the epidemiological data, we expect most of New Tics subjects to fall in the Remitted Tics subgroup. Longitudinal scans of the New Tics children will enable us to assess within-subject changes that occur with remittance or persistence of tics. This study will also apply machine learning tools, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVMs), to characterize features that distinguish Remitted Tics and Existing TS/CTD groups. Those features will then be used to predict whether tics in the New Tics group will remit (Remitted Tics) or persist (Converted TS/CTD) on an individual patient basis. Thus, we will be poised to identify differences, and potentially early predictors, of remittance and TS/CTD.  This study will provide innovative, important data on a common clinical presentation: the child with New Tics. Completing our aims successfully will allow individual prediction of remission or progression, or at least will allow a New Tics sample to be enriched for high risk of developing TS/CTD, which would make prevention studies for TS/CTD feasible. We will also gain insight into the neurobiology of New Tics. Finally, this study is an essential first step towards a definitive longitudinal study that can improve diagnostic accuracy and settle questions of cause and effect. With successful completion of our aims, similar methods can be applied to other childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders, setting the stage for early treatment or prevention of chronicity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Roughly 1 out of 5 school age children will develop tics, i.e. repetitive, purposeless movements or noises. However, only about 3% of all children have a chronic tic disorder, such as Tourette syndrome (TS), so tics are transient (lasting less than 1 year) in most children with tics. Tics can cause significant morbidity and adversely affect quality of life. It is of great clinical and scientific interest to be able to predict which child with newonset of tics will go on to have morbidity from chronic tics, and understanding of the neurobiology of transient tics has an excellent chance of improving our ability to manage these patients and perhaps even prevent development of TS. More generally, this approach may give insights into how to approach other neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism.",PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH NEW-ONSET TICS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA,8995710,R21NS091635,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Remittance', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'School-Age Population', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Tic disorder', 'Transient Tics', 'Vocal Tics', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prevent', 'tool', 'unpublished works']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,190625,0.027580056606546405
"Real-Time Prediction of Acute Arrest in Infants with Single Ventricle Physiology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use; (2) To improve the performance of this algorithm by incorporating additional sensor technologies; (3) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post-surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a validation study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 and 3 focus on improving the detection accuracy of the algorithm using Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring, and relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Real-Time Prediction of Acute Arrest in Infants with Single Ventricle Physiology,9324456,R56HL131574,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Staging', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'infancy', 'mortality', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'technology/technique', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R56,2016,277123,0.04382798776230995
"Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is defined as a severe infection with dangerous physiologic changes, organ dysfunction or death, which hospitalizes over 1.6 million people in the U.S. annually. Sepsis is a priority for the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services due to its healthcare impact, incidence and staggering annual cost, which exceed $20 billion and 5% of all U.S. hospital costs. All sepsis patients, even those with mild sepsis are at risk for in- hospital complications and death, but have improved outcomes if identified early. Sepsis recognition, however, is challenging due to the heterogeneity of patients who may manifest a wide array of clinical presentations. Electronic medical record (EMR) linked computer programs, known as clinical decision support (CDS) tools, have become ubiquitous to assist providers, including identifying sepsis patients. Unfortunately, all CDS tools in the literature miss 20-30% of sepsis patients and frequently misidentify non-sepsis patients as sepsis patients. Inaccurate CDS tools generate far too many false positive alerts, creating the dangerous condition of “alert fatigue” in which providers become habituated to all alerts, threatening patient safety and even leading to fatal consequences.  The PI and Co-I of this proposal collaboratively developed a CDS software called Sepsis-Alert for adult emergency department (ED) patients. It was fully implemented into Detroit Medical Center's (DMC) EMR live environment and has now been continually operational to provide real-time ongoing monitoring of all ED patients at Sinai Grace Hospital of DMC since October 2014. Our analysis of 25,000 ED visits reveals that while Sepsis-Alert's performance exceeds any reported performance, it still remains unacceptably inaccurate. All the CDS tools, including ours, have two limitations: (1) they lack a mechanism to learn from their past erroneous decisions and consequently repeat the same mistakes again and again, and (2) their decision- making process is fixed and treats all patients in the same way even in face of high heterogeneity of patients,  The main thrust of this research project is to develop an innovative prototype CDS software that functions like Sepsis-Alert but without the two limitations for the same ED sepsis screening purpose. We will develop the software system by utilizing data extracted from the EMR and will test and fine tune the system in over 35,000 retrospective and prospective patients at Sinai Grace Hospital. The proposed prototype, Intelligent Sepsis Alert, will have the cutting edge capabilities of recognizing the subtleties of sepsis, categorizing patients and learning from its own mistakes to avoid repeat them. CDS tools of the future can and must be better. Machine learning is the solution to optimizing patient care without creating a harmful environment. The final deliverable of this project will be a highly accurate and advanced program readily adoptable by any health system or hospital to improve sepsis care and create a safer healthcare environment. 1 Project Narrative  Sepsis is a toxic response to a severe infection and represents a healthcare epidemic, which afflicts millions of people and accounts for 5% of all hospital costs and over $20 billion in the U.S. annually. This project's objective is to develop a cutting edge computer based tool, called Intelligent Sepsis Alert, with the power of machine intelligence (a form of artificial intelligence) and the ability to learn that will accurately identify sepsis patients for healthcare providers extremely early in their hospital course to ensure that patients receive all of the necessary life-saving interventions they need. Intelligent Sepsis Alert will be readily adoptable by other hospitals and health systems and by providing the critical real-time, bedside support for early sepsis identification will translate into multitudes of deaths prevented, abundant intensive care unit admissions avoided, hundreds of thousands of dollars saved and thousands of wasted nursing and physician man-hours eliminated.",Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning,9166164,R21HS024750,[' '],AHRQ,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,149836,0.018571270286194905
"Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome disease in the United States. Despite this, epidemiologic investigations into childhood asthma are limited by variations in asthma diagnosis across sites and inefficient utilization of electronic medical records (EMRs) to facilitate large- scale studies. Algorithms based on structured data (e.g., ICD-9 codes) have shown strong specificity, but lack the sensitivity required for population-based studies for asthma. Manual EMR reviews allow application of well- recognized criteria-based definitions such as the Asthma Predictive Index (API) or the Predetermined Asthma Criteria (PAC), but are labor-intensive and expensive, and therefore not feasible for population-level studies. Because of the lack of consistent, reproducible, and efficient asthma ascertainment methods, the use of inconsistent a. asthma criteria, b. ascertainment processes, and c. sampling frames results in inconsistent asthma cohorts and study results for clinical trials or other studies. This inconsistency causes confusion, delayed translation of important study findings into clinical practice, and may obscure the true heterogeneity of asthma. Our long-term goal is to advance research and clinical care for asthma, by developing a robust software tool to streamline the process of automatic medical record ascertainment of asthma based on the asthma criteria (PAC and API). We propose to augment traditional structured data criteria with natural language processing (NLP) techniques to account for unstructured text. Thus, the main goal of this proposal is to develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for automating API, and apply the NLP algorithms for both PAC and API to identify a cohort of children with asthma. In addition, we will use the tools to characterize children with asthma thereby demonstrating its usefulness in epidemiological investigations and also possibly in asthma management. We hypothesize that asthma criteria-based NLP algorithms applied to the EMR will allow us to identify and characterize asthma status accurately, consistently, and efficiently. In Aim 1, we will develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for API. In Aim 2, we will apply both NLP-API (developed under Aim 1) and NLP-PAC (our recently developed PAC-based NLP algorithm) to two evaluation cohorts. In Aim 3, we will characterize the subgroups of children with asthma identified under Aim 2 by assessing the association of NLP-ascertained asthma status with lung function and biomarkers for asthma. The expected outcomes of the proposed study are: (i) enhanced research capabilities for asthma by enabling more consistent, reproducible, and efficient large-scale asthma ascertainment, sampling frames, and timing estimations; (ii) a basis for improving timely asthma diagnosis and care through clinical decision support systems; and (iii) advancement of the use of NLP techniques for clinical studies. Successful completion of this project will provide an accurate, consistent, and efficient tool for addressing the significant burden of asthma in children and a framework for extension to other chronic diseases and adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome diseases in the United States. However, conducting research on and developing quality improvement initiatives around asthma management at the population level is difficult, primarily due to the inconsistent identification of who has asthma and who doesn't. Identification of asthma status from review of medical records is very time consuming and expensive. Thus, researchers and clinicians often use more easily available but potentially inconsistent ways to determine asthma status, such as review of diagnostic billing codes. This results in varied cohorts of people defined as having asthma that are associated with inconsistent study outcomes in asthma such as risk of asthma or asthma control. We will use natural language processing, a computer based search of electronic medical records (clinical notes), to efficiently determine who has asthma, what kind of asthma, and the onset of recognizable asthma symptoms that identify asthma efficiently, accurately, and consistently. An algorithm that robustly ascertains the status of asthma, and by extension possibly other chronic diseases, will accelerate scientific discoveries on asthma, enhance translation of research findings into clinical practice, and ultimately improve patient care.",Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records,9032521,R01HL126667,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'ICD-9', 'Information Retrieval', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'evidence based guidelines', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'tool']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2016,383120,0.10701432351383669
"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9176080,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', 'Adenoidal structure', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2016,788036,0.025287160055924133
"A preschool biomarker for literacy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as one in ten children have the poor reading and spelling skills that comprise developmental dyslexia. It is widely accepted that there is a neurological basis; however, the nature of that basis is hotly debated. Nevertheless, one consistent view is that poor phonological processing-the ability to access and manipulate the sound units of language-is involved in dyslexia. Indeed, a majority of children with reading deficits exhibit difficulties on an array of phonological processing tasks. A growing body of research has discovered that speech-sound transcription, as measured by electrophysiology, shows striking relationships with phonological processing skills and reading ability in school-age children. As such, we have developed a suite of subcortical and cortical physiological tests that probe some of the core deficits that researchers have postulated as the root elements of poor phonological processing. We will target the subcortical processing of time-varying signals and stimulus regularities, and cortical hemispheric specialization to both fast and slow signals. In a longitudinal cohort of four- to eight-year-olds, we will model the normal neurological speech transcription process, quantify its development, and examine its relationship with the development of literacy-related skills. Our intention is that by leveraging these electrophysiological probes to a pre-reading age group, a biomarker, in preschoolers, may be found that predicts a child's eventual reading skill as he/she progresses through the primary grades. If such a biomarker is found, it would pave the way for earlier and more effectively targeted intervention. As objective neurophysiological measures of literacy become available, a logical step is to apply what has been learned about subcortical and cortical physiology and their relationships with reading to young pre- readers. The outcome of the proposed work will be a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of literacy, particularly in pre-literate children, and a means to exploit objective biological responses as biomarkers of future literacy. This outcome will positively impact our understanding of the core deficits leading to poor reading, and has the potential to spur early intervention programs to head off the potential onset of developmental dyslexia.",A preschool biomarker for literacy,9032506,R01HD069414,"['4 year old', '8 year old', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Brainstem Responses', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Stem', 'Cerebral Dominance', 'Child', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental reading disorder', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Employee Strikes', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Financial cost', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Schools', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reading Disorder', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcription Process', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'age group', 'auditory pathway', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive skill', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'corticofugal fiber', 'experience', 'falls', 'intervention program', 'literacy', 'literate', 'neurophysiology', 'peer', 'phonology', 'reading ability', 'reading difficulties', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'sound', 'spelling', 'stimulus processing']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,373707,0.01937641698083258
"SCH: kHealth: Semantic Multisensory Mobile Approach to Personalized Asthma Care ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The proliferation of smartphones and sensors has made continuous monitoring of physiology, environment, and public health notifications possible. However, personalized digital health and patient empowerment will become reality only if massive multisensory and multimodal observational data is processed within patient context and made actionable to enable early detection; better diagnosis, effective prevention and treatment of the disease; and improve the quality of life. This research will be performed in the context of asthma, which affects 300 million people and claims over 250,000 lives worldwide annually. According to CDC, 9.3% of US children have asthma. Understanding asthma and its management is challenging; it is a multifactorial disease with subjective causes and symptoms, and extant diagnosis and treatment guidelines can be improved using evidence-based action recommendation. With the advent of mobile and connected sensors, timely information about asthma triggers has become available, and its exploitation requires precisely understanding and quantifying the sensed data's role for preventive and proactive assessment of asthma. In this application led by computer scientists and a practicing clinician, we address the central problem of deriving actionable information from data monitored using kHealth technology. Through a pilot study, we have tested our kHealth kit equipped on several pediatric patients under the guidance of a clinical doctor for reliable data collection and patient operation, with promising initial results. We build on this foundation by addressing the problem of semantic representation, integration, abstraction, and personalized interpretation of heterogeneous observations spanning physiological, environmental data, and online data in the context of medical knowledge. Our primary hypothesis is that an evidence-based approach to asthma can help doctors determine more precisely the cause, severity and control of asthma, and can alert patients to seek timely clinical assistance to better manage asthma. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This application direclty relates to NICHD mission of improving health of children, with focus on asthma that affects a significant population.

"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,9134726,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'routine care', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,653525,0.01726785952632485
"SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions}: According to the 2010 US census (http://www.census.gov/prod/2011 pubs/acsbr1 0-12. pdf) 2.8 million school-aged children (aged 5 to 17) suffer from some form of mental and/or physical disability. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) guarantees such children equal access to education. However, children aged 1 to 5, while even more in need of early rehabilitation therapy and social interaction, do not receive the same attention. This proposal describes a plan for developing a new paradigm for pediatric rehabilitation. The paradigm involves robots that interact socially with special needs children, within a closed feedback control loop. Its components include new methods for modeling and representation of children motion, visual activity recognition, machine learning and behavior adaptation, and general-sum game-theoretic analysis of human-robot interaction. The research groups in the two collaborating institutions, University of Delaware (UD) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), have produced preliminary results and evidence which suggest that the envisioned technical innovations in the domains mentioned above are feasible, and that physical implementation is possible.  There are three intertwined research thrusts in the proposed activity, that address specific long-standing challenges in each area: 1. pediatric rehabilitation: develop a robot-assisted, pediatric rehabilitation environment which combines motor training with social interaction; 2. computer vision and perception: develop interpretable perception and machine learning algorithms for adaptive activity recognition; 3. robot control: develop the control and coordination algorithms to enable directed and purposeful human-robot interaction. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Each year, 10 000 infants in the U.S. develop cerebral palsy and 4 000 infants have birth defects of the spine and the brain. The motor delays for these infants have lifelong consequences. This gap in mobility is a significant secondary impairment. We propose a new portable motor rehabilitation system with social robotic interfaces that maximizes rehabilitation dosage. The project will provide insights into motor development in special needs children suggesting a new early intervention paradigm for children with motor disabilities.",SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation,9067563,R01HD087133,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Dancing', 'Data', 'Delaware', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Feedback', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Perception', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Visual', 'Visual Motion', 'Weight', 'aged', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cognitive disability', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'learned behavior', 'meetings', 'neuromuscular', 'peer', 'personalized medicine', 'robot assistance', 'skeletal', 'social']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2015,503237,0.015573940714889479
"Enhanced Ascertainment of Asthma Status Via Natural Language Processing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that almost one-half of Americans suffer from chronic diseases, yet epidemiologic investigations are limited by the difficulty of ascertaining disease status at scale, even in the era of electronic medical records (EMRs). For example, algorithms based on structured data (e.g., ICD-9 codes) for asthma lack the sensitivity required for population-based studies, while manual medical record reviews of EMRs are labor-intensive and thus inefficient for population-scale ascertainment of disease status. The lack of efficient ways to ascertain disease status has severely restricted the scope of investigation for chronic diseases such as asthma. Furthermore, there is a temporal progression of a patient's true disease status, and this may not be reflected in the clinical diagnosis of that disease. We previously reported that two-thirds of children with asthma had a delay in their diagnosis (median: 3.3 years), with subsequent conditions like remission or relapse largely unreported. Such information about disease progression may be recorded during manual medical record review, but, again, manual review limits investigations and conclusions to small-scale studies. Our long term goal is to accelerate epidemiological investigations of chronic diseases and their temporal progression by streamlining medical record review. The main goal of this proposal is to extend a preliminary NLP-based system for asthma status ascertainment by identifying time-situated classifications of asthma onset, remission, and relapse. We will validate this system in a population health setting and release it as an open-source tool. We hypothesize that NLP methods in the EMR allow us to ascertain asthma status and to track asthma disease progression with greater accuracy and efficiency than conventional approaches (billing codes or manual medical record review). In Aim 1, we will extend our preliminary NLP system to ascertain the patient-level disease progression of asthma. Most significantly, we will ascertain time-situated asthma remission and relapse, two important events in the natural history of asthma. We will also improve methods of aggregating events, employ temporal expression and relation extraction, include structured data sources, and implement automatic feature selection. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the NLP system for its accuracy in ascertaining asthma onset, relapse, and remission. We will also verify the epidemiological (construct) validity against existing studies, and disseminate the NLP system as an open-source project, Adept (Aggregation of Disease Evidence for Patient Timelines). Expected Outcomes: The proposed NLP system will: (i) orient clinical NLP techniques toward time-situated patient-level solutions; (ii) expand the scale of research capabilities for asthma; and (iii) provide a basis for decision support and other applications. Successful completion of this project would provide an open-source tool for ascertaining the disease progression of asthma with a general approach to aggregating evidence.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children, yet studying asthma in large populations is difficult because it is costly to read through medical records to determine who has asthma and when they got it. We aim to use electronic medical records (especially clinical notes) to efficiently determine who has asthma and track its progression over time. An algorithm that tracks disease status over time will potentially enable further research on chronic diseases, and will ultimately improve patient care.                ",Enhanced Ascertainment of Asthma Status Via Natural Language Processing,8860691,R21AI116839,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'ICD-9', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Solutions', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'open source', 'population based', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NIAID,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2015,198750,0.0423730668154882
"Nasal biomarkers of asthma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects 9.3% of children and 8.0% of adults in the US. Mild to moderate asthma can be difficult to diagnose and manage given waxing and waning symptoms. The airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation that underlie asthma are challenging to assess regularly and easily. Given the accessibility of the nose for assessment and monitoring, it is clinically and scientifically compelling to identify nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. To date, several lower airway pathogens have been associated with asthma. In separate studies, host gene expression in the airway has been associated with asthma. Host and microbes undoubtedly interact in asthma. A nasal biomarker that could accurately identify mild/moderate asthma and provide information on host vs. microbial contributions and their relative causality to disease would be highly useful for clinical care and research. We hypothesize that causal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma can be identified through network-based examination of nasal gene expression and microbiota. We will recruit subjects with mild/moderate asthma, severe asthma, and controls from whom we will generate the first paired system-wide profiles of host and microbiome in asthma. In Aim 1, we will focus on host characterization and identify nasal transcript biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma by RNA-sequence profiling of nasal brushings, differential gene expression analysis, and machine learning. In Aim 2, we will perform the first study of the nasal microbiome in asthma to identify nasal microbial biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. We will generate 16S rRNA data from nasal swabs to identify bacterial taxa associated with mild/moderate asthma, apply metagenomic inference to ascertain their functions, perform metagenomic sequencing for identification of non-bacterial taxa, and apply machine learning to distinguish microbial classifiers of mild/moderate asthma. We will be the first to reconstruct bacterial functions associated with asthma through metagenomic inference, and the first to apply metagenomic sequencing to well- characterized asthmatics. In Aim 3, we will identify causal nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma through data-driven, network approaches that integrate genetic, transcriptome, microbiome, and clinical data. We will link host to microbiome by constructing interaction networks, characterize the association between genetic variation and gene expression by eQTL detection, and infer causal drivers of mild/moderate asthma through Bayesian network construction. We will project asthma-specific subnetworks onto our networks, and compare our networks to those for other respiratory diseases to identify coherent modules of genes and microbes dysregulated in asthma. In all aims, we will assess for relevance to asthma more broadly by testing for the identified biomarkers in nasal and bronchial samples from severe asthmatics. We expect that our results will lead to the development of a nasal test that can be used for the clinical management and investigation of mild/moderate asthma, a prevalent disease that is currently suboptimally diagnosed and managed.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma impairs quality of life and leads to emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and sometimes death in people of all ages and walks of life. To identify noninvasive, predictive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we will comprehensively profile and examine nasal gene expression and the nasal microbial community in subjects with mild/moderate and severe asthma. We will use computational biology to construct networks that reflect the interactions and interconnectivity of host and microbes in asthma, and identify nasal biomarker candidates that we expect will lead to a nasal test for asthma.            ",Nasal biomarkers of asthma,8941822,R01AI118833,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Network-based', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Sequences', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Waxes', 'airway inflammation', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'bronchial epithelium', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'epidemiologic data', 'forest', 'fungus', 'genetic analysis', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'pathogen', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus identification']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2015,707364,0.09796373503614768
"PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH NEW-ONSET TICS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders are often debilitating and are increasing in prevalence. Tourette Syndrome/Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD), we propose, has a course that lends itself especially well to discovering optimal strategies for early diagnosis and prevention of developmental disorders. Common clinical practice and epidemiological data suggest that a large fraction (10-25%) of all children manifest motor and/or vocal tics at some age. Yet only 1-3% of all children have tics for the full year required for diagnosis of TS/CTD. The objective of the proposed research is to understand the structural and functional neuroimaging features of children with new-onset tics (""New Tics""), as the neurobiology of this population has not been investigated. Studying children with New Tics should provide the most leverage in understanding why tics remit in some children but not others. This proposal compares neuroimaging features of New Tics to TS/CTD and to controls, implements machine-learning tools to predict whether children with New Tics will remit or develop TS/CTD, and utilizes longitudinal scans to identify within-subject changes that occur as tics remit or persist.  The proposed study will apply resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs fcMRI) and structural MRI methods to investigate children with New Tics. Neuroimaging will be conducted on children with current, new- onset tics, and comparisons will be made to existing MRI data from children with diagnosed TS/CTD and controls. Follow-up evaluation (1 year after tic onset) of New Tics will allow us to identify which children's tics remitted completely and whic were actually in the earliest stages of TS/CTD, thus sorting this group into Remitted Tics and Converted TS/CTD subgroups. Based on the epidemiological data, we expect most of New Tics subjects to fall in the Remitted Tics subgroup. Longitudinal scans of the New Tics children will enable us to assess within-subject changes that occur with remittance or persistence of tics. This study will also apply machine learning tools, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVMs), to characterize features that distinguish Remitted Tics and Existing TS/CTD groups. Those features will then be used to predict whether tics in the New Tics group will remit (Remitted Tics) or persist (Converted TS/CTD) on an individual patient basis. Thus, we will be poised to identify differences, and potentially early predictors, of remittance and TS/CTD.  This study will provide innovative, important data on a common clinical presentation: the child with New Tics. Completing our aims successfully will allow individual prediction of remission or progression, or at least will allow a New Tics sample to be enriched for high risk of developing TS/CTD, which would make prevention studies for TS/CTD feasible. We will also gain insight into the neurobiology of New Tics. Finally, this study is an essential first step towards a definitive longitudinal study that can improve diagnostic accuracy and settle questions of cause and effect. With successful completion of our aims, similar methods can be applied to other childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorders, setting the stage for early treatment or prevention of chronicity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Roughly 1 out of 5 school age children will develop tics, i.e. repetitive, purposeless movements or noises. However, only about 3% of all children have a chronic tic disorder, such as Tourette syndrome (TS), so tics are transient (lasting less than 1 year) in most children with tics. Tics can cause significant morbidity and adversely affect quality of life. It is of great clinical and scientific interest to be able to predict which child with newonset of tics will go on to have morbidity from chronic tics, and understanding of the neurobiology of transient tics has an excellent chance of improving our ability to manage these patients and perhaps even prevent development of TS. More generally, this approach may give insights into how to approach other neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism.                ",PREDICTING OUTCOME IN CHILDREN WITH NEW-ONSET TICS USING NEUROIMAGING DATA,8870047,R21NS091635,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Relative (related person)', 'Remittance', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'School-Age Population', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Tic disorder', 'Transient Tics', 'Vocal Tics', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'unpublished works']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,228750,0.027580056606546405
"Integrative Genomics Approaches to Model the Genetic Architecture of Asthma ABSTRACT  Asthma, a chronic respiratory disease affecting over 20 million Americans and 300 million people worldwide,  results from the complex interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Many studies have  searched for individual genetic variants that contribute to asthma susceptibility, but a thorough understanding  of the genetic basis of asthma has not been achieved. Our main hypothesis is that the genetic architecture  underlying asthma susceptibility can be better understood by considering multiple genes and incorporating  multiple sources of genomic data, including human asthma and mouse airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR)  data. This hypothesis will be addressed via specific aims in which we will: (1) identify genetic variants that  predispose humans to asthma and modulate human AHR by mapping regions associated with AHR in inbred  strains of mice to human genome-wide association data, (2) use gene expression data, known protein-protein  interactions, and known functional pathways to enhance the search for asthma and AHR genetic variants in  humans, and (3) integrate individual human genetic variants to create a multivariate predictive model of  asthma. Novel variants identified by Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be validated by replication in independent  human populations of asthmatics. The predictive model created in Specific Aim 3 will be validated through  replication and prediction in independent human populations of asthmatics. By completing the specific aims,  we hope to make progress towards the development of a comprehensive model of the genetics of asthma,  particularly of asthma characterized by increased airways responsiveness. By completing this proposal, we hope to identify genetic variants that modulate asthma risk. Identifying such  variants could provide biological insights that may eventually lead to a better understanding of asthma.  Additionally, we will create a predictive model of asthma, which could potentially lead to the development of a  clinical prognostic test of who is at risk for developing asthma.",Integrative Genomics Approaches to Model the Genetic Architecture of Asthma,8847988,R00HL105663,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Asthma', 'Biological', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'airway hyperresponsiveness', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'insight', 'mouse development', 'mouse genome', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'trait']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R00,2015,221134,0.03564736567206637
"Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome disease in the United States. Despite this, epidemiologic investigations into childhood asthma are limited by variations in asthma diagnosis across sites and inefficient utilization of electronic medical records (EMRs) to facilitate large- scale studies. Algorithms based on structured data (e.g., ICD-9 codes) have shown strong specificity, but lack the sensitivity required for population-based studies for asthma. Manual EMR reviews allow application of well- recognized criteria-based definitions such as the Asthma Predictive Index (API) or the Predetermined Asthma Criteria (PAC), but are labor-intensive and expensive, and therefore not feasible for population-level studies. Because of the lack of consistent, reproducible, and efficient asthma ascertainment methods, the use of inconsistent a. asthma criteria, b. ascertainment processes, and c. sampling frames results in inconsistent asthma cohorts and study results for clinical trials or other studies. This inconsistency causes confusion, delayed translation of important study findings into clinical practice, and may obscure the true heterogeneity of asthma. Our long-term goal is to advance research and clinical care for asthma, by developing a robust software tool to streamline the process of automatic medical record ascertainment of asthma based on the asthma criteria (PAC and API). We propose to augment traditional structured data criteria with natural language processing (NLP) techniques to account for unstructured text. Thus, the main goal of this proposal is to develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for automating API, and apply the NLP algorithms for both PAC and API to identify a cohort of children with asthma. In addition, we will use the tools to characterize children with asthma thereby demonstrating its usefulness in epidemiological investigations and also possibly in asthma management. We hypothesize that asthma criteria-based NLP algorithms applied to the EMR will allow us to identify and characterize asthma status accurately, consistently, and efficiently. In Aim 1, we will develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for API. In Aim 2, we will apply both NLP-API (developed under Aim 1) and NLP-PAC (our recently developed PAC-based NLP algorithm) to two evaluation cohorts. In Aim 3, we will characterize the subgroups of children with asthma identified under Aim 2 by assessing the association of NLP-ascertained asthma status with lung function and biomarkers for asthma. The expected outcomes of the proposed study are: (i) enhanced research capabilities for asthma by enabling more consistent, reproducible, and efficient large-scale asthma ascertainment, sampling frames, and timing estimations; (ii) a basis for improving timely asthma diagnosis and care through clinical decision support systems; and (iii) advancement of the use of NLP techniques for clinical studies. Successful completion of this project will provide an accurate, consistent, and efficient tool for addressing the significant burden of asthma in children and a framework for extension to other chronic diseases and adults.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome diseases in the United States. However, conducting research on and developing quality improvement initiatives around asthma management at the population level is difficult, primarily due to the inconsistent identification of who has asthma and who doesn't. Identification of asthma status from review of medical records is very time consuming and expensive. Thus, researchers and clinicians often use more easily available but potentially inconsistent ways to determine asthma status, such as review of diagnostic billing codes. This results in varied cohorts of people defined as having asthma that are associated with inconsistent study outcomes in asthma such as risk of asthma or asthma control. We will use natural language processing, a computer based search of electronic medical records (clinical notes), to efficiently determine who has asthma, what kind of asthma, and the onset of recognizable asthma symptoms that identify asthma efficiently, accurately, and consistently. An algorithm that robustly ascertains the status of asthma, and by extension possibly other chronic diseases, will accelerate scientific discoveries on asthma, enhance translation of research findings into clinical practice, and ultimately improve patient care.            ",Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records,8853379,R01HL126667,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'ICD-9', 'Information Retrieval', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'evidence based guidelines', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2015,388870,0.10701432351383669

"In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In utero exposure to antidepressants was recently associated with increased risk for autism in an analysis of a large health care claims database. This result is consistent with twin studies indicating greater concordance for autism among dizygotic twins compared to non-twin siblings, likely pointing to shared in utero risk. The need to clarify the risk posed by antidepressants is acute, as it has profound public health implications. Confirmation of the finding would support a rare modifiable risk factor for autism, and help to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder. Conversely, if the finding is a false positive, it might lead to undertreatment of major depression among pregnant women, with consequent risks to both mother and fetus. The proposed study will utilize electronic medical record (EMR) data from more than 4 million individuals in a large New England health system. The investigators and their colleagues have previously applied an EMR query toolkit, which they helped to develop, to characterize treatment outcomes and conduct pharmacovigilance and genetic studies in psychiatry and beyond. Notably, this health care system includes large obstetrics, psychiatry, and pediatric practices, and is a referral center for child neuropsychiatri disorders. Children ages 4-12 with a diagnosis of autism who were delivered in this system will be identified using validated natural language processing tools. A matched (2:1) cohort of children with a diagnosis of ADHD will be identified, along with a matched (5:1) control cohort of children receiving routine pediatric care. The EMR will then be used to match each child with their mother, allowing characterization of maternal socio-demographic status, medical and psychiatric illness, and medication treatment during pregnancy. To further improve precision, Massachusetts state birth certificate data will be queried. This data includes details of perinatal care, exposures, and complications, as well as paternal age and socio-demographic status. Regression models will be applied to the resulting data set, encompassing more than 700 children with autism, 1400 children with ADHD, and 3500 healthy control children. In addition to examining the association between antidepressant exposure and autism liability, with appropriate control for confounding, this data set will allow investigation of other putative in utero and perinatal risk factors, creating a key resource for future studies. This project will innovate in two key respects. First, it will address the problem of confounding by indication present in prior antidepressant pharmacovigilance studies, using tools developed by the investigators for characterizing depression severity/comorbidity and course to better match cases and controls. Second, it will establish the utility of an EMR-based approach for studying pregnancy exposures and outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will estimate the amount of autism risk, if any, associated with exposure to antidepressants and other medicines before birth. This information will allow mothers to make more informed decisions weighing the risks and benefits of treatment for depression and related illnesses during pregnancy. It may also contribute to a better understanding of the causes of autism itself.",In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism,8829343,R01MH100286,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Dizygotic Twins', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic study', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Massachusetts', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Paternal Age', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal Care', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'Twin Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'depressive symptoms', 'improved', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maternal depression', 'modifiable risk', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'prenatal risk factor', 'randomized trial', 'sample collection', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2015,348000,-0.01802813185837678
"Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this set of applications, we propose to initiate a new Learning Disabilities Research Hub focusing initially on high risk for mathematics failure. We proposed to situate this new Hub within an existing strong infrastructure for pediatric neurobehavioral and imaging research, the Pediatric Neurocognition, Imaging, and Genetics (PING) data resource. PING infrastructure provides many important advantages for building a new cross disciplinary and multiple-investigator program, as it has already brought together a strong team of behavioral, clinical, imaging, computational, and genetics investigators as a closely integrated team, and most importantly has attracted a very talented group of young investigators and graduate students focused on the problems addressed in the proposed research. A unifying theme of the studies that our team has proposed is the notion that math failure, and perhaps academic failure more broadly, emerges gradually through interactions of putative early conceptual weaknesses, attributable in some cases to poor functioning and anomalous neural architecture in specific neural systems, with increasing reward-based biases that contribute, additively or non-additively, to suppression of the normal learning trajectory. Consistent with this theme we refer to our proposed research hub as the Roles of Emotion and Choice (REaCh) in Learning Disabilities Research Hub (LDRH). The proposed REaCh Hub has 3 components: a new research project to investigate key questions about learning and the neural architecture during early development in children at high risk for math failure, and two cores. The Administrative Core proposal describes the management plan for the new Hub and the PING infrastructure that will be adapted for the new studies; and focuses on a nested mentoring plan for ensuring close interaction between trainees at different levels with mid-level and senior investigators within focused workgroups. The assets of the Core for within-Hub and extra-Hub data sharing are also described. A Developmental Infrastructure Core proposal describes the administration of a small grant program to support novel work within the Hub by junior investigators, trainees, and investigators from disciplines outside of the original REaCh LDRH group. A new Learning Disabilities Research Hub would be created to bring scientists with different kinds of expertise together to study learning disabilities, focusing initially on risk for math failure in young children. The scientists would study learning and brain development in children and focus specifically on the importance of the children's emotional responses to mathematical information.",Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework,8885862,R24HD075489,"['12 year old', 'Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pediatric Research', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'computational neuroscience', 'data sharing', 'elementary school', 'emotional factor', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical model', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'skills']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2015,547017,0.010644737814579265
"A preschool biomarker for literacy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as one in ten children have the poor reading and spelling skills that comprise developmental dyslexia. It is widely accepted that there is a neurological basis; however, the nature of that basis is hotly debated. Nevertheless, one consistent view is that poor phonological processing-the ability to access and manipulate the sound units of language-is involved in dyslexia. Indeed, a majority of children with reading deficits exhibit difficulties on an array of phonological processing tasks. A growing body of research has discovered that speech-sound transcription, as measured by electrophysiology, shows striking relationships with phonological processing skills and reading ability in school-age children. As such, we have developed a suite of subcortical and cortical physiological tests that probe some of the core deficits that researchers have postulated as the root elements of poor phonological processing. We will target the subcortical processing of time-varying signals and stimulus regularities, and cortical hemispheric specialization to both fast and slow signals. In a longitudinal cohort of four- to eight-year-olds, we will model the normal neurological speech transcription process, quantify its development, and examine its relationship with the development of literacy-related skills. Our intention is that by leveraging these electrophysiological probes to a pre-reading age group, a biomarker, in preschoolers, may be found that predicts a child's eventual reading skill as he/she progresses through the primary grades. If such a biomarker is found, it would pave the way for earlier and more effectively targeted intervention. As objective neurophysiological measures of literacy become available, a logical step is to apply what has been learned about subcortical and cortical physiology and their relationships with reading to young pre- readers. The outcome of the proposed work will be a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of literacy, particularly in pre-literate children, and a means to exploit objective biological responses as biomarkers of future literacy. This outcome will positively impact our understanding of the core deficits leading to poor reading, and has the potential to spur early intervention programs to head off the potential onset of developmental dyslexia.",A preschool biomarker for literacy,8826794,R01HD069414,"['4 year old', '8 year old', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Brainstem Responses', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Stem', 'Cerebral Dominance', 'Child', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental reading disorder', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Employee Strikes', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Financial cost', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Schools', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reading Disorder', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcription Process', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'age group', 'auditory pathway', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive skill', 'cohort', 'contextual factors', 'corticofugal fiber', 'experience', 'falls', 'intervention program', 'literacy', 'literate', 'neurophysiology', 'peer', 'phonology', 'reading ability', 'reading difficulties', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'sound', 'spelling', 'stimulus processing']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,356936,0.01937641698083258
"Pediatric Research using Integrated Sensor Monitoring Systems (PRISMS): Data and Software Coordination and Integration Center (DSCIC) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric Research using Integrated Sensor Monitoring Systems (PRISMS), a new program initiated by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), aims to develop sensor-based integrated health monitoring systems to serve as research tools to measure pediatric environmental, physiological, and behavioral factors in epidemiological studies of asthma, and eventually other chronic diseases, in the pediatric population. To address the critical need to create a central data and software resource for integrating and facilitating access, analysis, and dissemination of data and software generated within the PRISMS program, we are proposing the University of Southern California PRISMS Data and Software Coordination and Integration Center (USC PRISMS DSCIC). Our team will work closely with the other two arms of PRISMS to coordinate and integrate outputs from the program's informatics platform centers that collect, analyze and present data from pediatric sensor-based health monitoring systems with an initial focus on pediatric asthma. We will ultimately address significant data science and tool development challenges associated with integrated monitoring systems datasets to enable important advances in our understanding of environmental determinants of pediatric asthma. Our proposal is structured around the four main research objectives specified in the RFA: 1) Integrated Knowledge Environment; 2) Data Integration; 3) Collaborative Environments and Technologies; and 4) Unified Access to PRISMS PTC Resources. The team is led by Co-PIs Drs. Jose Luis Ambite and Frank Gilliland at USC. Outdoor air pollution at levels occurring in many urban areas around the world has substantial adverse effects on health. Children in general, and children with asthma in particular, are sensitive to the adverse effects of outdoor air pollutants, includin ozone, nitrogen oxides, and respirable particulate matter. The prevalence of asthma in the U.S. increased from 7.3% in 2001 to 8.4% in 2010, while children aged 0-17 years had asthma prevalence of 9.5%, compared to adults aged 18 and over at 7.7%, for the period 2008-2010. Consistent with the increased vulnerability of children, a large and growing number of studies show that children living near traffic or high levels of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, or PM have increased risks of adverse respiratory effects, such as new-onset asthma, asthma symptoms, exacerbations, school absences, and asthma-related hospitalizations. Ongoing studies also show that genetic variations in antioxidant and inflammatory genes play a role in ozone susceptibility. New methods in big data science are providing powerful tools for confronting critical research questions in asthma, in a range of areas from genomics to health informatics to environmental research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pediatric Research using Integrated Sensor Monitoring Systems (PRISMS), a new program initiated by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), aims to develop sensor-based integrated health monitoring systems to serve as research tools to measure pediatric environmental, physiological, and behavioral factors in epidemiological studies of asthma, and eventually other chronic diseases, in the pediatric population.

"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF.

"Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite the availability of three major classes of medications for asthma, the response to therapy is highly variable, with as many one-half of all patients being non-responders. Pharmacogenetics provides the promise of ""personalized medicine"", whereby an individual's response to therapy will be guided a priori by his or her genetic make-up. While we have made substantial progress in identifying candidate genes influencing the response to asthma medications, none of these associations accounts for more than a small proportion of the variability in the response. It is clear that to accomplish the goal of ""personalized medicine"" in asthma, we need to identify multiple additional pharmacogenetics loci. Recent advances in technology offer the unprecedented ability to rapidly identify the genetic variants that influence drug treatment response on a genome-wide scale. The major goal of this project is to enhance our prior work in the field of asthma pharmacogenetics via the efficient, but detailed, identification of novel genes associated with the asthmatic response to medications. To accomplish this, we have structured our specific aims as follows: 1. We will analyze GWAS data from 3493 subjects in asthma clinical trials of B2-adrenergic and glucocorticoid treatment response, and perform association testing to determine which genetic variants are associated with an altered therapeutic response. Machine learning approaches will be utilized to model the genetic association data. 2. Robust and replicated pharmacogenetic associations will be explored at the molecular, cellular, and integrative genomic levels to establish functional variants and pharmacogenetic mechanisms. Functional methods will involve bioinformatics tools, mRNA profiling, systems genetics, and cellular and animal models of asthma therapeutic responsiveness. 3. We will develop and validate a set of predictive tests of asthma therapeutic response to short acting B2-adrenergic and inhaled glucocorticoid drugs using clinical and functional knowledge and high-resolution analysis of genetic associations, including epistasis and gene-drug interaction. Additional aims relate to our collaboration with PharmGKB and the PGRN and helping investigators interested in pharmacogenetics. In addition to the GWAS samples, nearly 7000 DNA samples and matching asthma phenotypic data are available for replication testing to validate the initial GWAS results and predictive tests. We believe that these findings will uncover sufficient new information that working models of prognostic tests combining genetic and clinical traits in the prediction of drug response in asthma will result. RELEVANCE: Asthma affects an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide and accounts for approximately $20 billion in direct health care costs in the United States annually, with the greatest proportion of those costs allocated to medication and hospitalization costs. The identification of genetic variants that can be used as the basis of a prognostic test to predict which individuals will or will not respond to therapy, thereby minimizing both need for trial and error medication dispensing and risk of hospitalizations due to inadequate therapy, has the potential to substantially decrease both morbidity and financial burden related to asthma.           n/a",Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment,8688300,U01HL065899,"['Accounting', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bioinformatics', 'Breathing', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genomics', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Height', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Work', 'adrenergic', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'interest', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pharmacogenetic testing', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2014,1919404,0.041601470757652
"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS APPROACHES TO MODEL THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF ASTHMA ABSTRACT  Asthma, a chronic respiratory disease affecting over 20 million Americans and 300 million people worldwide,  results from the complex interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Many studies have  searched for individual genetic variants that contribute to asthma susceptibility, but a thorough understanding  of the genetic basis of asthma has not been achieved. Our main hypothesis is that the genetic architecture  underlying asthma susceptibility can be better understood by considering multiple genes and incorporating  multiple sources of genomic data, including human asthma and mouse airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR)  data. This hypothesis will be addressed via specific aims in which we will: (1) identify genetic variants that  predispose humans to asthma and modulate human AHR by mapping regions associated with AHR in inbred  strains of mice to human genome-wide association data, (2) use gene expression data, known protein-protein  interactions, and known functional pathways to enhance the search for asthma and AHR genetic variants in  humans, and (3) integrate individual human genetic variants to create a multivariate predictive model of  asthma. Novel variants identified by Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be validated by replication in independent  human populations of asthmatics. The predictive model created in Specific Aim 3 will be validated through  replication and prediction in independent human populations of asthmatics. By completing the specific aims,  we hope to make progress towards the development of a comprehensive model of the genetics of asthma,  particularly of asthma characterized by increased airways responsiveness. By completing this proposal, we hope to identify genetic variants that modulate asthma risk. Identifying such  variants could provide biological insights that may eventually lead to a better understanding of asthma.  Additionally, we will create a predictive model of asthma, which could potentially lead to the development of a  clinical prognostic test of who is at risk for developing asthma.",INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS APPROACHES TO MODEL THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF ASTHMA,8727091,R00HL105663,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Asthma', 'Biological', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'airway hyperresponsiveness', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'insight', 'mouse development', 'mouse genome', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'trait']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R00,2014,80611,0.03564736567206637
"In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In utero exposure to antidepressants was recently associated with increased risk for autism in an analysis of a large health care claims database. This result is consistent with twin studies indicating greater concordance for autism among dizygotic twins compared to non-twin siblings, likely pointing to shared in utero risk. The need to clarify the risk posed by antidepressants is acute, as it has profound public health implications. Confirmation of the finding would support a rare modifiable risk factor for autism, and help to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder. Conversely, if the finding is a false positive, it might lead to undertreatment of major depression among pregnant women, with consequent risks to both mother and fetus. The proposed study will utilize electronic medical record (EMR) data from more than 4 million individuals in a large New England health system. The investigators and their colleagues have previously applied an EMR query toolkit, which they helped to develop, to characterize treatment outcomes and conduct pharmacovigilance and genetic studies in psychiatry and beyond. Notably, this health care system includes large obstetrics, psychiatry, and pediatric practices, and is a referral center for child neuropsychiatri disorders. Children ages 4-12 with a diagnosis of autism who were delivered in this system will be identified using validated natural language processing tools. A matched (2:1) cohort of children with a diagnosis of ADHD will be identified, along with a matched (5:1) control cohort of children receiving routine pediatric care. The EMR will then be used to match each child with their mother, allowing characterization of maternal socio-demographic status, medical and psychiatric illness, and medication treatment during pregnancy. To further improve precision, Massachusetts state birth certificate data will be queried. This data includes details of perinatal care, exposures, and complications, as well as paternal age and socio-demographic status. Regression models will be applied to the resulting data set, encompassing more than 700 children with autism, 1400 children with ADHD, and 3500 healthy control children. In addition to examining the association between antidepressant exposure and autism liability, with appropriate control for confounding, this data set will allow investigation of other putative in utero and perinatal risk factors, creating a key resource for future studies. This project will innovate in two key respects. First, it will address the problem of confounding by indication present in prior antidepressant pharmacovigilance studies, using tools developed by the investigators for characterizing depression severity/comorbidity and course to better match cases and controls. Second, it will establish the utility of an EMR-based approach for studying pregnancy exposures and outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will estimate the amount of autism risk, if any, associated with exposure to antidepressants and other medicines before birth. This information will allow mothers to make more informed decisions weighing the risks and benefits of treatment for depression and related illnesses during pregnancy. It may also contribute to a better understanding of the causes of autism itself.            ",In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism,8663964,R01MH100286,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Dizygotic Twins', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Massachusetts', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Paternal Age', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal Care', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'Twin Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'depressive symptoms', 'improved', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maternal depression', 'modifiable risk', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'prenatal risk factor', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'sample collection', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2014,348000,-0.01802813185837678
"Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this set of applications, we propose to initiate a new Learning Disabilities Research Hub focusing initially on high risk for mathematics failure. We proposed to situate this new Hub within an existing strong infrastructure for pediatric neurobehavioral and imaging research, the Pediatric Neurocognition, Imaging, and Genetics (PING) data resource. PING infrastructure provides many important advantages for building a new cross disciplinary and multiple-investigator program, as it has already brought together a strong team of behavioral, clinical, imaging, computational, and genetics investigators as a closely integrated team, and most importantly has attracted a very talented group of young investigators and graduate students focused on the problems addressed in the proposed research. A unifying theme of the studies that our team has proposed is the notion that math failure, and perhaps academic failure more broadly, emerges gradually through interactions of putative early conceptual weaknesses, attributable in some cases to poor functioning and anomalous neural architecture in specific neural systems, with increasing reward-based biases that contribute, additively or non-additively, to suppression of the normal learning trajectory. Consistent with this theme we refer to our proposed research hub as the Roles of Emotion and Choice (REaCh) in Learning Disabilities Research Hub (LDRH). The proposed REaCh Hub has 3 components: a new research project to investigate key questions about learning and the neural architecture during early development in children at high risk for math failure, and two cores. The Administrative Core proposal describes the management plan for the new Hub and the PING infrastructure that will be adapted for the new studies; and focuses on a nested mentoring plan for ensuring close interaction between trainees at different levels with mid-level and senior investigators within focused workgroups. The assets of the Core for within-Hub and extra-Hub data sharing are also described. A Developmental Infrastructure Core proposal describes the administration of a small grant program to support novel work within the Hub by junior investigators, trainees, and investigators from disciplines outside of the original REaCh LDRH group. A new Learning Disabilities Research Hub would be created to bring scientists with different kinds of expertise together to study learning disabilities, focusing initially on risk for math failure in young children. The scientists would study learning and brain development in children and focus specifically on the importance of the children's emotional responses to mathematical information.",Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework,8705558,R24HD075489,"['12 year old', 'Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pediatric Research', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'computational neuroscience', 'data sharing', 'elementary school', 'emotional factor', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical model', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'skills']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2014,538747,0.010644737814579265
"A preschool biomarker for literacy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as one in ten children have the poor reading and spelling skills that comprise developmental dyslexia. It is widely accepted that there is a neurological basis; however, the nature of that basis is hotly debated. Nevertheless, one consistent view is that poor phonological processing-the ability to access and manipulate the sound units of language-is involved in dyslexia. Indeed, a majority of children with reading deficits exhibit difficulties on an array of phonological processing tasks. A growing body of research has discovered that speech-sound transcription, as measured by electrophysiology, shows striking relationships with phonological processing skills and reading ability in school-age children. As such, we have developed a suite of subcortical and cortical physiological tests that probe some of the core deficits that researchers have postulated as the root elements of poor phonological processing. We will target the subcortical processing of time-varying signals and stimulus regularities, and cortical hemispheric specialization to both fast and slow signals. In a longitudinal cohort of four- to eight-year-olds, we will model the normal neurological speech transcription process, quantify its development, and examine its relationship with the development of literacy-related skills. Our intention is that by leveraging these electrophysiological probes to a pre-reading age group, a biomarker, in preschoolers, may be found that predicts a child's eventual reading skill as he/she progresses through the primary grades. If such a biomarker is found, it would pave the way for earlier and more effectively targeted intervention.          As objective neurophysiological measures of literacy become available, a logical step is to apply what has been learned about subcortical and cortical physiology and their relationships with reading to young pre- readers. The outcome of the proposed work will be a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of literacy, particularly in pre-literate children, and a means to exploit objective biological responses as biomarkers of future literacy. This outcome will positively impact our understanding of the core deficits leading to poor reading, and has the potential to spur early intervention programs to head off the potential onset of developmental dyslexia.

"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins.

"Computer-based simulation Pediatric disaster Triage Training for Emergency Medica  ABSTRACT Children are not small adults. Nowhere is this understanding more critical than in the aftermath of a disaster event, when the strained resources of healthcare providers must be directed where they can do the most good in the least time. Frontline responders are unfortunately rarely trained in the principles and practice of pediatric disaster triage and often do not understand the special pediatric needs and considerations they must take into account when acting decisively and quickly to direct actions in a stressful situation that is often chaotic and always taxing. Researchers at Yale University School of Medicine (YSM) have developed a live simulation training protocol on pediatric disaster triage that has been shown to be effective but also relatively expensive, resource-intensive and therefore difficult to disseminate widely. The Yale New Haven Health System Center for Healthcare Solutions (YNHHS-CHS) has taken up this challenge, proposing to use YNHHS-CHS expertise with online training solutions and web development to create and implement a computer-based simulation that will build on the live simulation model and carry the research into a new medium that will be more cost-effective and able to more broadly engage and educate greater numbers of emergency medical service providers (EMSPs). YNHHS-CHS specialists with design and training skills will use the expertise of YSM pediatric emergency medicine specialists Mark Cicero, MD, who developed the live simulation training, and Marc Auerbach, MD, and the YNHHS-CHS network of emergency management contacts to engage EMSPs in this learning process. The computer- based simulation training will be delivered to 600 EMSPs in southern New England (Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts) and evaluated for future broader dissemination. Multiple retention evaluations, scenario-based and decision-tree driven, will be conducted: immediately at the end of the online training and at three- and six-month intervals post-training to determine the value of the training in delivering information and fostering the ability to apply it in simulated scenarios. A 10% random sampling of participants will also take an in-person live simulation retention evaluation to further assess and demonstrate the usefulness of the training. The project objective is to achieve a success rate of >80% of learners performing pediatric disaster triage with accuracy that is >/=90%. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Emergency planners often focus on large-scale disaster events, but smaller-scale local events are far more common and together have a much greater impact on the health and well-being of communities - particularly events involving children, such as bus accidents or school-related crises. Children are often present at a disaster site and sorting out their needs and requirements can be a significant challenge to emergency medical service providers. This project brings together Yale School of Medicine pediatric emergency medicine specialists and Yale New Haven Health System Center for Healthcare Solutions instructional design and emergency management experts who are committed to developing a training that delivers the greatest possible efficiency and effectiveness with the greatest possibl accuracy in making choices and directing appropriate healthcare resources to improve disaster event outcomes and mitigate negative consequences for children, disasters' most vulnerable and often least understood victims.            ",Computer-based simulation Pediatric disaster Triage Training for Emergency Medica,8664515,R18HS022837,[' '],AHRQ,YALE UNIVERSITY,R18,2014,720455,0.016583365851853347
"Innovative Research Methods to Study Children with Multiple Chronic Conditions     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Children with multiple chronic conditions - two or more chronic conditions that affect the person at the same time - represent an important group of individuals who receive inadequate quality of healthcare and experience suboptimal health outcomes. Clinicians, researchers, administrators, and policy experts are currently uninformed on how to best improve care for these children. This is, in part, because of two methodological challenges that are particularly problematic when studying children with multiple chronic conditions: 1) the ability to comprehensively measure and group comorbid conditions in children and 2) the ability to assess pediatric comorbidity burden on a population level. This proposal will validate and test an innovative set of methods that will help overcome these challenges. Although the set of methods, collectively, is new to the study of children with multiple chronic conditions, we have found components of the set to be feasible and valuable in our prior work. The specific aims of this proposal are 1) to adapt for children a publicly available diagnosis classification scheme (i.e., AHRQ's Chronic Condition Indicator and Clinical Classification System) to name and count coexisting chronic conditions in children; 2) to determine the prevalence and the healthcare cost and utilization (total and excessive) of each type of child with multiple chronic conditions; 3) to complete an evidenced-based prioritization process, based on the Pareto Principle, to describe the relative contribution of combinations of chronic conditions to prevalence and to healthcare cost and utilization; and 4) to employ an innovative, machine learning method (i.e., regression tree boosting) to systematically assess every interaction of coexisting chronic conditions in children to predict healthcare cost and utilization The proposed work will be conducted in existing datasets that contain 10.7 million children with comprehensive Medicaid claims data (i.e., community, emergency, home, inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy care, etc.) from 28 states as well as 3.7 million hospitalized children from the all-payer, nationally-representative Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database developed by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Use of the methods and results generated from this proposal will help clinics, hospitals, communities, states, health systems, payers, federal agencies, and others identify children with multiple chronic conditions, describe their coexisting conditions, determine which of these children have the largest impact on the pediatric healthcare system, and quantify how much of their health care cost and utilization could be avoided with high quality of care. This information will help prioritize which subgroups of children with multiple chronic conditions to target for comparative effectiveness research, quality improvement initiatives, and health system redesign. This proposal is aligned with the mission of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to improve the quality of health care for all Americans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The research in this proposal is relevant to public health because it will rapidly advance our understanding of the U.S. population of children living with multiple chronic conditions. The research will help identify and describe the children living with multiple chronic conditions, as well as the health care cost and utilization experienced by them. The methods and findings from the research will help improve the health and wellbeing of these children.            ",Innovative Research Methods to Study Children with Multiple Chronic Conditions,8726574,R21HS023092,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2014,179808,0.0403182196751654

"Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite the availability of three major classes of medications for asthma, the response to therapy is highly variable, with as many one-half of all patients being non-responders. Pharmacogenetics provides the promise of ""personalized medicine"", whereby an individual's response to therapy will be guided a priori by his or her genetic make-up. While we have made substantial progress in identifying candidate genes influencing the response to asthma medications, none of these associations accounts for more than a small proportion of the variability in the response. It is clear that to accomplish the goal of ""personalized medicine"" in asthma, we need to identify multiple additional pharmacogenetics loci. Recent advances in technology offer the unprecedented ability to rapidly identify the genetic variants that influence drug treatment response on a genome-wide scale. The major goal of this project is to enhance our prior work in the field of asthma pharmacogenetics via the efficient, but detailed, identification of novel genes associated with the asthmatic response to medications. To accomplish this, we have structured our specific aims as follows: 1. We will analyze GWAS data from 3493 subjects in asthma clinical trials of B2-adrenergic and glucocorticoid treatment response, and perform association testing to determine which genetic variants are associated with an altered therapeutic response. Machine learning approaches will be utilized to model the genetic association data. 2. Robust and replicated pharmacogenetic associations will be explored at the molecular, cellular, and integrative genomic levels to establish functional variants and pharmacogenetic mechanisms. Functional methods will involve bioinformatics tools, mRNA profiling, systems genetics, and cellular and animal models of asthma therapeutic responsiveness. 3. We will develop and validate a set of predictive tests of asthma therapeutic response to short acting B2-adrenergic and inhaled glucocorticoid drugs using clinical and functional knowledge and high-resolution analysis of genetic associations, including epistasis and gene-drug interaction. Additional aims relate to our collaboration with PharmGKB and the PGRN and helping investigators interested in pharmacogenetics. In addition to the GWAS samples, nearly 7000 DNA samples and matching asthma phenotypic data are available for replication testing to validate the initial GWAS results and predictive tests. We believe that these findings will uncover sufficient new information that working models of prognostic tests combining genetic and clinical traits in the prediction of drug response in asthma will result. RELEVANCE: Asthma affects an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide and accounts for approximately $20 billion in direct health care costs in the United States annually, with the greatest proportion of those costs allocated to medication and hospitalization costs. The identification of genetic variants that can be used as the basis of a prognostic test to predict which individuals will or will not respond to therapy, thereby minimizing both need for trial and error medication dispensing and risk of hospitalizations due to inadequate therapy, has the potential to substantially decrease both morbidity and financial burden related to asthma.           n/a",Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment,8516556,U01HL065899,"['Accounting', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bioinformatics', 'Breathing', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genomics', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Height', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Work', 'adrenergic', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'interest', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pharmacogenetic testing', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2013,1864564,0.041601470757652
"Clustering to identify novel phenotypes in childhood asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood asthma is a heterogeneous disease. This is evident given the broad range of clinical characteristics and treatment responses for children defined as asthmatic. Current classification systems for asthma phenotypes are inadequate to fully understand the pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and treatment outcomes of asthma.  Given the heterogeneous nature of asthma, novel ensemble clustering of childhood asthma using data from five clinical trials is proposed. It is hypothesized these discovered phenotypes (or clusters) will have defining characteristics that suggest unique etiologies and appropriate treatment strategies. The aims are to (1) perform ensemble clustering of childhood asthma and describe characteristics for the observed phenotype, (2) develop a model to classify childhood asthma into the phenotypes previously defined in Aim (1), and (3) retrospectively determine whether childhood asthma phenotypes identified by ensemble clustering correlate with treatment responses in clinical trials. We expect (1) fewer than ten phenotypes to be identified with some attributes over- represented in each phenotype, (2) to develop a simple, easily interpretable classification model, and (3) to identify phenotypes for which clinical trial treatments were effective or ineffective.  On the path toward personalized medicine, novel research with ensemble clustering and a large dataset with clinical trial outcomes will advance the field by validating and hypothesizing childhood asthma pathogenesis, pathophysiology and treatment responses.        Childhood asthma is likely not a single disease, but rather a heterogeneous disease with many phenotypes (or subtypes). Computational analysis can identify and elucidate the characteristics of these phenotypes. These phenotypes may provide insight into the causes of and appropriate treatments for asthma.

"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS APPROACHES TO MODEL THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF ASTHMA ABSTRACT  Asthma, a chronic respiratory disease affecting over 20 million Americans and 300 million people worldwide,  results from the complex interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Many studies have  searched for individual genetic variants that contribute to asthma susceptibility, but a thorough understanding  of the genetic basis of asthma has not been achieved. Our main hypothesis is that the genetic architecture  underlying asthma susceptibility can be better understood by considering multiple genes and incorporating  multiple sources of genomic data, including human asthma and mouse airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR)  data. This hypothesis will be addressed via specific aims in which we will: (1) identify genetic variants that  predispose humans to asthma and modulate human AHR by mapping regions associated with AHR in inbred  strains of mice to human genome-wide association data, (2) use gene expression data, known protein-protein  interactions, and known functional pathways to enhance the search for asthma and AHR genetic variants in  humans, and (3) integrate individual human genetic variants to create a multivariate predictive model of  asthma. Novel variants identified by Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be validated by replication in independent  human populations of asthmatics. The predictive model created in Specific Aim 3 will be validated through  replication and prediction in independent human populations of asthmatics. By completing the specific aims,  we hope to make progress towards the development of a comprehensive model of the genetics of asthma,  particularly of asthma characterized by increased airways responsiveness. By completing this proposal, we hope to identify genetic variants that modulate asthma risk. Identifying such  variants could provide biological insights that may eventually lead to a better understanding of asthma.  Additionally, we will create a predictive model of asthma, which could potentially lead to the development of a  clinical prognostic test of who is at risk for developing asthma.",INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS APPROACHES TO MODEL THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF ASTHMA,8724089,R00HL105663,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Asthma', 'Biological', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'airway hyperresponsiveness', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'insight', 'mouse development', 'mouse genome', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'trait']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R00,2013,237047,0.03564736567206637
"Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this set of applications, we propose to initiate a new Learning Disabilities Research Hub focusing initially on high risk for mathematics failure. We proposed to situate this new Hub within an existing strong infrastructure for pediatric neurobehavioral and imaging research, the Pediatric Neurocognition, Imaging, and Genetics (PING) data resource. PING infrastructure provides many important advantages for building a new cross disciplinary and multiple-investigator program, as it has already brought together a strong team of behavioral, clinical, imaging, computational, and genetics investigators as a closely integrated team, and most importantly has attracted a very talented group of young investigators and graduate students focused on the problems addressed in the proposed research. A unifying theme of the studies that our team has proposed is the notion that math failure, and perhaps academic failure more broadly, emerges gradually through interactions of putative early conceptual weaknesses, attributable in some cases to poor functioning and anomalous neural architecture in specific neural systems, with increasing reward-based biases that contribute, additively or non-additively, to suppression of the normal learning trajectory. Consistent with this theme we refer to our proposed research hub as the Roles of Emotion and Choice (REaCh) in Learning Disabilities Research Hub (LDRH). The proposed REaCh Hub has 3 components: a new research project to investigate key questions about learning and the neural architecture during early development in children at high risk for math failure, and two cores. The Administrative Core proposal describes the management plan for the new Hub and the PING infrastructure that will be adapted for the new studies; and focuses on a nested mentoring plan for ensuring close interaction between trainees at different levels with mid-level and senior investigators within focused workgroups. The assets of the Core for within-Hub and extra-Hub data sharing are also described. A Developmental Infrastructure Core proposal describes the administration of a small grant program to support novel work within the Hub by junior investigators, trainees, and investigators from disciplines outside of the original REaCh LDRH group. A new Learning Disabilities Research Hub would be created to bring scientists with different kinds of expertise together to study learning disabilities, focusing initially on risk for math failure in young children. The scientists would study learning and brain development in children and focus specifically on the importance of the children's emotional responses to mathematical information.",Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework,8554790,R24HD075489,"['12 year old', 'Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Animals', 'Anisotropy', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pediatric Research', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'computational neuroscience', 'data sharing', 'elementary school', 'emotional factor', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'mathematical model', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'skills']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2013,529465,0.010644737814579265
"In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In utero exposure to antidepressants was recently associated with increased risk for autism in an analysis of a large health care claims database. This result is consistent with twin studies indicating greater concordance for autism among dizygotic twins compared to non-twin siblings, likely pointing to shared in utero risk. The need to clarify the risk posed by antidepressants is acute, as it has profound public health implications. Confirmation of the finding would support a rare modifiable risk factor for autism, and help to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder. Conversely, if the finding is a false positive, it might lead to undertreatment of major depression among pregnant women, with consequent risks to both mother and fetus. The proposed study will utilize electronic medical record (EMR) data from more than 4 million individuals in a large New England health system. The investigators and their colleagues have previously applied an EMR query toolkit, which they helped to develop, to characterize treatment outcomes and conduct pharmacovigilance and genetic studies in psychiatry and beyond. Notably, this health care system includes large obstetrics, psychiatry, and pediatric practices, and is a referral center for child neuropsychiatri disorders. Children ages 4-12 with a diagnosis of autism who were delivered in this system will be identified using validated natural language processing tools. A matched (2:1) cohort of children with a diagnosis of ADHD will be identified, along with a matched (5:1) control cohort of children receiving routine pediatric care. The EMR will then be used to match each child with their mother, allowing characterization of maternal socio-demographic status, medical and psychiatric illness, and medication treatment during pregnancy. To further improve precision, Massachusetts state birth certificate data will be queried. This data includes details of perinatal care, exposures, and complications, as well as paternal age and socio-demographic status. Regression models will be applied to the resulting data set, encompassing more than 700 children with autism, 1400 children with ADHD, and 3500 healthy control children. In addition to examining the association between antidepressant exposure and autism liability, with appropriate control for confounding, this data set will allow investigation of other putative in utero and perinatal risk factors, creating a key resource for future studies. This project will innovate in two key respects. First, it will address the problem of confounding by indication present in prior antidepressant pharmacovigilance studies, using tools developed by the investigators for characterizing depression severity/comorbidity and course to better match cases and controls. Second, it will establish the utility of an EMR-based approach for studying pregnancy exposures and outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will estimate the amount of autism risk, if any, associated with exposure to antidepressants and other medicines before birth. This information will allow mothers to make more informed decisions weighing the risks and benefits of treatment for depression and related illnesses during pregnancy. It may also contribute to a better understanding of the causes of autism itself.            ",In utero antidepressant exposures and risk for autism,8483291,R01MH100286,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Dizygotic Twins', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Massachusetts', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Paternal Age', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal Care', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'Twin Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'depressive symptoms', 'improved', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maternal depression', 'modifiable risk', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'prenatal risk factor', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'sample collection', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2013,343560,-0.01802813185837678
"A preschool biomarker for literacy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as one in ten children have the poor reading and spelling skills that comprise developmental dyslexia. It is widely accepted that there is a neurological basis; however, the nature of that basis is hotly debated. Nevertheless, one consistent view is that poor phonological processing-the ability to access and manipulate the sound units of language-is involved in dyslexia. Indeed, a majority of children with reading deficits exhibit difficulties on an array of phonological processing tasks. A growing body of research has discovered that speech-sound transcription, as measured by electrophysiology, shows striking relationships with phonological processing skills and reading ability in school-age children. As such, we have developed a suite of subcortical and cortical physiological tests that probe some of the core deficits that researchers have postulated as the root elements of poor phonological processing. We will target the subcortical processing of time-varying signals and stimulus regularities, and cortical hemispheric specialization to both fast and slow signals. In a longitudinal cohort of four- to eight-year-olds, we will model the normal neurological speech transcription process, quantify its development, and examine its relationship with the development of literacy-related skills. Our intention is that by leveraging these electrophysiological probes to a pre-reading age group, a biomarker, in preschoolers, may be found that predicts a child's eventual reading skill as he/she progresses through the primary grades. If such a biomarker is found, it would pave the way for earlier and more effectively targeted intervention.          As objective neurophysiological measures of literacy become available, a logical step is to apply what has been learned about subcortical and cortical physiology and their relationships with reading to young pre- readers. The outcome of the proposed work will be a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of literacy, particularly in pre-literate children, and a means to exploit objective biological responses as biomarkers of future literacy. This outcome will positively impact our understanding of the core deficits leading to poor reading, and has the potential to spur early intervention programs to head off the potential onset of developmental dyslexia.

"Clustering to identify novel phenotypes in childhood asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood asthma is a heterogeneous disease. This is evident given the broad range of clinical characteristics and treatment responses for children defined as asthmatic. Current classification systems for asthma phenotypes are inadequate to fully understand the pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and treatment outcomes of asthma.  Given the heterogeneous nature of asthma, novel ensemble clustering of childhood asthma using data from five clinical trials is proposed. It is hypothesized these discovered phenotypes (or clusters) will have defining characteristics that suggest unique etiologies and appropriate treatment strategies. The aims are to (1) perform ensemble clustering of childhood asthma and describe characteristics for the observed phenotype, (2) develop a model to classify childhood asthma into the phenotypes previously defined in Aim (1), and (3) retrospectively determine whether childhood asthma phenotypes identified by ensemble clustering correlate with treatment responses in clinical trials. We expect (1) fewer than ten phenotypes to be identified with some attributes over- represented in each phenotype, (2) to develop a simple, easily interpretable classification model, and (3) to identify phenotypes for which clinical trial treatments were effective or ineffective.  On the path toward personalized medicine, novel research with ensemble clustering and a large dataset with clinical trial outcomes will advance the field by validating and hypothesizing childhood asthma pathogenesis, pathophysiology and treatment responses.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood asthma is likely not a single disease, but rather a heterogeneous disease with many phenotypes (or subtypes). Computational analysis can identify and elucidate the characteristics of these phenotypes. These phenotypes may provide insight into the causes of and appropriate treatments for asthma.              Childhood asthma is likely not a single disease, but rather a heterogeneous disease with many phenotypes (or subtypes).

"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS APPROACHES TO MODEL THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF ASTHMA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Asthma, a chronic respiratory disease affecting over 20 million Americans and 300 million people worldwide, results from the complex interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Many studies have searched for individual genetic variants that contribute to asthma susceptibility, but a thorough understanding of the genetic basis of asthma has not been achieved. Our main hypothesis is that the genetic architecture underlying asthma susceptibility can be better understood by considering multiple genes and incorporating multiple sources of genomic data, including human asthma and mouse airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR) data. This hypothesis will be addressed via specific aims in which we will: (1) identify genetic variants that predispose humans to asthma and modulate human AHR by mapping regions associated with AHR in inbred strains of mice to human genome-wide association data, (2) use gene expression data, known protein-protein interactions, and known functional pathways to enhance the search for asthma and AHR genetic variants in humans, and (3) integrate individual human genetic variants to create a multivariate predictive model of asthma. Novel variants identified by Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be validated by replication in independent human populations of asthmatics. The predictive model created in Specific Aim 3 will be validated through replication and prediction in independent human populations of asthmatics. By completing the specific aims, we hope to make progress towards the development of a comprehensive model of the genetics of asthma, particularly of asthma characterized by increased airways responsiveness.         By completing this proposal, we hope to identify genetic variants that modulate asthma risk. Identifying such variants could provide biological insights that may eventually lead to a better understanding of asthma. Additionally, we will create a predictive model of asthma, which could potentially lead to the development of a clinical prognostic test of who is at risk for developing asthma.

"Neurobehavioral Contributors to Math Failure: A Reward-Based Learning Framework     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this set of applications, we propose to initiate a new Learning Disabilities Research Hub focusing initially on high risk for mathematics failure. We proposed to situate this new Hub within an existing strong infrastructure for pediatric neurobehavioral and imaging research, the Pediatric Neurocognition, Imaging, and Genetics (PING) data resource. PING infrastructure provides many important advantages for building a new cross disciplinary and multiple-investigator program, as it has already brought together a strong team of behavioral, clinical, imaging, computational, and genetics investigators as a closely integrated team, and most importantly has attracted a very talented group of young investigators and graduate students focused on the problems addressed in the proposed research. A unifying theme of the studies that our team has proposed is the notion that math failure, and perhaps academic failure more broadly, emerges gradually through interactions of putative early conceptual weaknesses, attributable in some cases to poor functioning and anomalous neural architecture in specific neural systems, with increasing reward-based biases that contribute, additively or non-additively, to suppression of the normal learning trajectory. Consistent with this theme we refer to our proposed research hub as the Roles of Emotion and Choice (REaCh) in Learning Disabilities Research Hub (LDRH). The proposed REaCh Hub has 3 components: a new research project to investigate key questions about learning and the neural architecture during eariy development in children at high risk for math failure, and two cores. The Administrative Core proposal describes the management  plan for the new Hub and the PING infrastructure that will be adapted for the new studies; and focuses on a  nested mentoring plan for ensuring close interaction between trainees at different levels with mid-level and  senior investigators within focused workgroups. The assets of the Core for within-Hub and extra-Hub data sharing are also described. A Developmental Infrastructure Core proposal describes the administration of a small grant program to support novel work within the Hub by junior investigators, trainees, and investigators  from disciplines outside ofthe original REaCh LDRH group.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A new Learning Disabilities Research Hub would be created to bring scientists with different kinds of expertise together to study learning disabilities, focuing initially on risk for math failure in young children.

"Molecular Genetic Investigation of Pediatric Myelodysplastic Syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of clonal stem cell disorders characterized by varying degrees of cytopenias, and ineffective and dysplastic hematopoiesis. MDS can be classified as primary de novo MDS with no apparent underlying cause and secondary MDS following congenital or acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) disorders or cytotoxic therapies. Little is known about initiating events leading to pediatric MDS. As a result, no targeted therapies exist and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only therapeutic option.  The heterogeneous clinical and laboratory presentation and limited availability of clinically well-annotated patient samples and in vivo models have posed significant obstacles to study the disease and to identify genetic alterations unique to pediatric MDS. Therefore pediatric MDS remains largely classified by morphologic and cytogenetic criteria that provide few clues as to the molecular basis. Over the last 18 months, we have developed the first nationwide comprehensive Pediatric MDS and BMF Disorder Patient Registry and Tissue Repository now involving 3 institutions and continuing to grow. The registry has collected samples from > 60 individual patients in addition to biological material from 3 unique kindreds with pediatric MDS. These samples form the basis for our first genomic sequencing analysis to gather preliminary data for future experiments and represent the power of this registry to elucidate pathogenic mutations associated with MDS.  Our unique team of investigators will exploit the registry and catalyze our efforts to determine the fundamental underpinnings of pediatric MDS. The team includes David Williams (clinical/translational hematology), Mark Fleming (pediatric hematopathology /hematological genetics), Benjamin Ebert (high throughput genomic technologies in adult MDS) and Kyriacos Markinanos (genetic linkage analysis). We will undertake preliminary studies to demonstrate feasibility, and generate genomic data that will provide the basis for future hypothesis-driven translational and clinical research studies on a national level.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The underlying genetics and pathophysiology of pediatric MDS is poorly understood. By exploiting several well-characterized families with inherited MDS, we will aim to identify the genetic basis for this disorder.

"A preschool biomarker for literacy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as one in ten children have the poor reading and spelling skills that comprise developmental dyslexia. It is widely accepted that there is a neurological basis; however, the nature of that basis is hotly debated. Nevertheless, one consistent view is that poor phonological processing-the ability to access and manipulate the sound units of language-is involved in dyslexia. Indeed, a majority of children with reading deficits exhibit difficulties on an array of phonological processing tasks. A growing body of research has discovered that speech-sound transcription, as measured by electrophysiology, shows striking relationships with phonological processing skills and reading ability in school-age children. As such, we have developed a suite of subcortical and cortical physiological tests that probe some of the core deficits that researchers have postulated as the root elements of poor phonological processing. We will target the subcortical processing of time-varying signals and stimulus regularities, and cortical hemispheric specialization to both fast and slow signals. In a longitudinal cohort of four- to eight-year-olds, we will model the normal neurological speech transcription process, quantify its development, and examine its relationship with the development of literacy-related skills. Our intention is that by leveraging these electrophysiological probes to a pre-reading age group, a biomarker, in preschoolers, may be found that predicts a child's eventual reading skill as he/she progresses through the primary grades. If such a biomarker is found, it would pave the way for earlier and more effectively targeted intervention.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As objective neurophysiological measures of literacy become available, a logical step is to apply what has been learned about subcortical and cortical physiology and their relationships with reading to young pre- readers. The outcome of the proposed work will be a deeper understanding of the biological underpinnings of literacy, particularly in pre-literate children, and a means to exploit objective biological responses as biomarkers of future literacy. This outcome will positively impact our understanding of the core deficits leading to poor reading, and has the potential to spur early intervention programs to head off the potential onset of developmental dyslexia.              As objective neurophysiological measures of literacy become available, a logical step is to apply what has been learned about subcortical and cortical physiology and their relationships with reading to young pre- readers.

"Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite the availability of three major classes of medications for asthma, the response to therapy is highly variable, with as many one-half of all patients being non-responders. Pharmacogenetics provides the promise of ""personalized medicine"", whereby an individual's response to therapy will be guided a priori by his or her genetic make-up. While we have made substantial progress in identifying candidate genes influencing the response to asthma medications, none of these associations accounts for more than a small proportion of the variability in the response. It is clear that to accomplish the goal of ""personalized medicine"" in asthma, we need to identify multiple additional pharmacogenetics loci. Recent advances in technology offer the unprecedented ability to rapidly identify the genetic variants that influence drug treatment response on a genome-wide scale. The major goal of this project is to enhance our prior work in the field of asthma pharmacogenetics via the efficient, but detailed, identification of novel genes associated with the asthmatic response to medications. To accomplish this, we have structured our specific aims as follows: 1. We will analyze GWAS data from 3493 subjects in asthma clinical trials of B2-adrenergic and glucocorticoid treatment response, and perform association testing to determine which genetic variants are associated with an altered therapeutic response. Machine learning approaches will be utilized to model the genetic association data. 2. Robust and replicated pharmacogenetic associations will be explored at the molecular, cellular, and integrative genomic levels to establish functional variants and pharmacogenetic mechanisms. Functional methods will involve bioinformatics tools, mRNA profiling, systems genetics, and cellular and animal models of asthma therapeutic responsiveness. 3. We will develop and validate a set of predictive tests of asthma therapeutic response to short acting B2-adrenergic and inhaled glucocorticoid drugs using clinical and functional knowledge and high-resolution analysis of genetic associations, including epistasis and gene-drug interaction. Additional aims relate to our collaboration with PharmGKB and the PGRN and helping investigators interested in pharmacogenetics. In addition to the GWAS samples, nearly 7000 DNA samples and matching asthma phenotypic data are available for replication testing to validate the initial GWAS results and predictive tests. We believe that these findings will uncover sufficient new information that working models of prognostic tests combining genetic and clinical traits in the prediction of drug response in asthma will result. RELEVANCE: Asthma affects an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide and accounts for approximately $20 billion in direct health care costs in the United States annually, with the greatest proportion of those costs allocated to medication and hospitalization costs.

"Using signatures of T-helper cell inflammation to phenotype human asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a common disease characterized by airway inflammation, reversible airway obstruction, and airway hyperresponsiveness. There is growing recognition of phenotypic heterogeneity in asthma, including in severity and response to medication. It is likely that these differences are driven by distinct underlying molecular phenotypes, the discovery of which would inform the development of targeted therapies. In prior studies using well-characterized patients with asthma, differences in gene expression from human airway epithelial cells identified two major groups of patients, one in which gene expression is strongly driven by the inflammatory the T-helper cell (Th2) cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13), which has been called Th2 ""high"" asthma, and another in which IL-13 driven genes are not significantly expressed above that level found in healthy controls, or ""Th2 low"" asthma. This work demonstrated that compared to Th2-low asthmatics, Th2-high subjects a better response to inhaled corticosteroids. Based on published data and our own preliminary data, we hypothesize that Th1 and Th17 pathways of inflammation define additional molecular phenotypes of human asthma. Our aims are to test this hypothesis, associate phenotypes to clinical characteristics including response to corticosteroids, and develop diagnostic tools for molecular phenotyping of human subjects based on Th1, Th2 and Th17 signatures. Th1, Th2, and Th17 signatures will be developed from microarray- based whole genome expression-profiling of cytokine-stimulated epithelial cell lines. These signatures will be used to cluster research asthma subjects into T helper subset phenotypes based on the gene expression profiles of their own airway epithelial cells obtained. The most informative epithelial cell genes will be used to develop a PCR-based test. A non-invasive test for these molecular phenotypes will be developed through the use of machine learning algorithms to find patterns in the whole genome expression profiles of subjects' peripheral blood samples. The identification of molecular phenotypes, and the availability of reliable tests to assign Th2, Th1, or Th17 phenotypes non-invasively would provide the potential to predict which medication will work best for an individual while avoiding unnecessary side effects form ineffective therapies, and to inform the development of therapies targeted to specific phenotypes by providing biomarkers during clinical trials.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is a very common lung disease affecting 7% of adults in America, and despite high treatment costs, up to 30% of patients do not respond to medications. Asthma has many forms with varying triggers, long-term outcomes and responses to medications. The goals of this work are to 1) apply technological advances in human genomics to discover distinct classes of asthma, and 2) develop tests based on these classes to predict which individuals will respond to a specific therapy, leading to more efficient care and less side effects from ineffective medicines.              Asthma is a very common lung disease affecting 7% of adults in America, and despite high treatment costs, up to 30% of patients do not respond to medications.

Our main hypothesis is that the genetic architecture underlying asthma susceptibility can be better understood by considering multiple genes and incorporating multiple sources of genomic data, including human asthma and mouse airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR) data. This hypothesis will be addressed via specific aims in which we will: (1) identify genetic variants that predispose humans to asthma and modulate human AHR by mapping regions associated with AHR in inbred strains of mice to human genome-wide association data, (2) use gene expression data, known protein-protein interactions, and known functional pathways to enhance the search for asthma and AHR genetic variants in humans, and (3) integrate individual human genetic variants to create a multivariate predictive model of asthma. Novel variants identified by Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be validated by replication in independent human populations of asthmatics. The predictive model created in Specific Aim 3 will be validated through replication and prediction in independent human populations of asthmatics. By completing the specific aims, we hope to make progress towards the development of a comprehensive model of the genetics of asthma, particularly of asthma characterized by increased airways responsiveness.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  By completing this proposal, we hope to identify genetic variants that modulate asthma risk. Identifying such variants could provide biological insights that may eventually lead to a better understanding of asthma. Additionally, we will create a predictive model of asthma, which could potentially lead to the development of a clinical prognostic test of who is at risk for developing asthma.            By completing this proposal, we hope to identify genetic variants that modulate asthma risk.

"Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite the availability of three major classes of medications for asthma, the response to therapy is highly variable, with as many one-half of all patients being non-responders. Pharmacogenetics provides the promise of ""personalized medicine"", whereby an individual's response to therapy will be guided a priori by his or her genetic make-up. While we have made substantial progress in identifying candidate genes influencing the response to asthma medications, none of these associations accounts for more than a small proportion of the variability in the response. It is clear that to accomplish the goal of ""personalized medicine"" in asthma, we need to identify multiple additional pharmacogenetics loci. Recent advances in technology offer the unprecedented ability to rapidly identify the genetic variants that influence drug treatment response on a genome-wide scale. The major goal of this project is to enhance our prior work in the field of asthma pharmacogenetics via the efficient, but detailed, identification of novel genes associated with the asthmatic response to medications. To accomplish this, we have structured our specific aims as follows: 1. We will analyze GWAS data from 3493 subjects in asthma clinical trials of B2-adrenergic and glucocorticoid treatment response, and perform association testing to determine which genetic variants are associated with an altered therapeutic response. Machine learning approaches will be utilized to model the genetic association data. 2. Robust and replicated pharmacogenetic associations will be explored at the molecular, cellular, and integrative genomic levels to establish functional variants and pharmacogenetic mechanisms. Functional methods will involve bioinformatics tools, mRNA profiling, systems genetics, and cellular and animal models of asthma therapeutic responsiveness. 3. We will develop and validate a set of predictive tests of asthma therapeutic response to short acting B2-adrenergic and inhaled glucocorticoid drugs using clinical and functional knowledge and high-resolution analysis of genetic associations, including epistasis and gene-drug interaction. Additional aims relate to our collaboration with PharmGKB and the PGRN and helping investigators interested in pharmacogenetics. In addition to the GWAS samples, nearly 7000 DNA samples and matching asthma phenotypic data are available for replication testing to validate the initial GWAS results and predictive tests. We believe that these findings will uncover sufficient new information that working models of prognostic tests combining genetic and clinical traits in the prediction of drug response in asthma will result. RELEVANCE: Asthma affects an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide and accounts for approximately $20 billion in direct health care costs in the United States annually, with the greatest proportion of those costs allocated to medication and hospitalization costs. The identification of genetic variants that can be used as the basis of a prognostic test to predict which individuals will or will not respond to therapy, thereby minimizing both need for trial and error medication dispensing and risk of hospitalizations due to inadequate therapy, has the potential to substantially decrease both morbidity and financial burden related to asthma.           n/a",Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment,7867594,U01HL065899,"['Accounting', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bioinformatics', 'Breathing', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genomics', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Height', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Work', 'adrenergic', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'interest', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pharmacogenetic testing', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2010,1992800,0.041601470757652

Description ""Bio-behavioral chronic disease management by families of young minority children"" seeks to reduce health disparities by investigating methods to close the gap between health information and health behaviors- specifically, the gap between instruction provided by clinicians to families of young children with chronic diseases and the capacity of economically stressed families to act on that instruction. Whether addressing asthma, diabetes, obesity, or tooth decay, needed now is trans-disciplinary translational research that tailors pharmacological and behavioral interventions to care management plans that parents are able to implement successfully. Envisioned is a computer ""Tool"" for use in community sites that assists community health workers in collaboration with families to: (1) determine children's level of risk for chronic diseases, (2) match them to clinicians and care plans, (3) characterize a family's capacity to engage in such plans, and (4) modify care plans to meet family's capacities. Target families are those disadvantaged by low-income, low-literacy, cultural barriers and minority status. Specific research aims are to develop, pilot test, and refine two ""Instruments"" that are integral to this Tool: (1) a 'disease risk assessment instrument' and (2) a culturally adaptable 'family capacity assessment instrument.' Early childhood caries (""ECC"") was selected as the exemplar chronic disease for this research by an existing 12-member multi-disciplinary Project Team comprised of social and behavioral scientists, clinicians, educational and informatics technologists, and health services researchers. ECC was selected because it is highly prevalent in young children, because preventive and therapeutic bio- behavioral therapies are available but underused, and because significant cost savings may accrue to governmental programs, insurers, and families if the need for dental repair can be reduced. The proposed 'disease risk assessment instrument' will experiment with inputting recognized biological (clinical, laboratory, psychological, and pharmacologic), and non biological (knowledge, logistic, socio-cultural, and environmental) risk factors into algorithm-supported ""classification and regression tree analyses"" and machine learning ""artificial neural networks"" to improve on current professionally-endorsed methods of classifying young children by risk. As the proposed 'family capacity assessment instrument' has been less developed to date by the Project Team, its ultimate form will be determined by this research. Success in developing and implementing the Tool and its two assessment Instruments can result in better oral health outcomes at lower cost through risk-based early intervention, disease suppression, individualized care, family engagement, and elimination of the need for dental surgery in children under the age of six.

"Automating Assessment of Asthma Care Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  To address the large discrepancy between consensus quality standards and healthcare services actually delivered to those eligible, the Institute of Medicine has called for new quality initiatives and has identified asthma as one if its priority areas. Each year, thousands of preventable deaths are attributed to asthma. The asthma-related health burden is especially pronounced in vulnerable populations. Opportunities to improve asthma care quality hinge on the capacity to comprehensively and routinely assess the care that is actually delivered to asthma patients. Current quality measurement studies require extensive clinical chart review and are not cost-effective on a public health scale. Healthcare information technology (Health IT) could have a big impact by enabling automated quality assessments. Electronic medical record (EMR) systems capture clinical information that could make comprehensive, cost effective quality assessment possible. However, much relevant information (and perhaps 50% or more of the necessary data) resides in free-text clinical notes, which presents a significant challenge to automated quality assessment. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient asthma care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of EMR data from two distinct health systems: a mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (Oregon Community Health Information Network) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the Pacific Northwest. This project leverages Health IT to assess and improve quality of care for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We propose to use an outpatient Asthma Care Quality (ACQ) measure set derived from the original RAND Quality Assessment Tools Project. We will first refine the ACQ measures using up-to-date clinical guidelines and consensus standards for outpatient diagnosis, treatment and management of asthma in patients older than 5 years. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the MediClass system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify ACQ-relevant clinical events in the electronic medical record. Then, we will apply the ACQ measures to assess current levels of asthma care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the association between ACQ measures of recommended asthma care and actual clinical outcomes using extensive longitudinal patient data available at the KPNW study site.          n/a",Automating Assessment of Asthma Care Quality,7498546,R18HS017022,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2008,395816,0.03167058519979674
"Using Absence-Causing Symptoms to Monitor Child Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       On any given weekday, more than one-fifth of the U.S. population is in schools. While we all want schools to be safe places-havens for learning-schoolchildren today face serious health threats including bioterrorism. In the proper project, we will develop and evaluate a system called ASIAN (Absenteeism-causing Symptom-Level Assessment Network), designed to monitor the health of children in schools. Our system focuses on monitoring children's school attendance, because most experts agree that absenteeism from school is an early sign of an outbreak in a community. However, school absenteeism is not a precise sign of an outbreak or epidemic. Absenteeism is often not even related to illness, reflecting, instead, problems in the child's home environment, important social or cultural obligations, and even opportunities for family recreation. But what if a system could identify absences due to illnesses and collect data on the symptoms causing the illness-related absences? Such a system might well offer an early, highly specific signal of an illness in a population, allowing public and school health officials to detect outbreaks in schools very early in their course. We propose to develop a VoiceXML speech processing system that can accurately capture during a brief telephone interview the symptoms a person is experiencing that are causing an absence. We propose to modify the ""work processes"" school districts use to have parents or guardians report that their children will be absent from school. Parents will use the interactive voice response questionnaire (or a web site, if they prefer) to report (on a voluntary basis) the symptoms that are causing the child's absence. We believe that monitoring of reports of such symptoms could both protect the health of children from bioterrorist attacks and from toxins in the environment. It could also improve their health on a daily basis by helping school nurses identify children with poorly managed chronic illnesses, and recognize and manage the routine outbreaks of infectious diseases that occur each year. The study plan focuses on creation of a computer telephone interviewing system and a formative evaluation that will include both qualitative and quantitative components and will assess the feasibility, validity, and potential usefulness of the system.             n/a",Using Absence-Causing Symptoms to Monitor Child Health,7497109,R21EB007466,"['Absenteeism', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asthma', 'Bioterrorism', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Computers', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Education', 'Educational Materials', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Environment', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exanthema', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fever', 'Goals', 'Head Nurses', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Incentives', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Just-in-time-concept', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Natural Disasters', 'Nausea', 'Nursing Schools', 'Occupational Health Nursing', 'Parents', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Primary Schools', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Questionnaires', 'Readiness', 'Recreation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'School Nursing', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Terrorism', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Toxin', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'hazard', 'high school', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'school health', 'social', 'speech processing', 'syndromic surveillance', 'tool', 'voice recognition']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2008,189263,0.0307494249159123
"Automating Assessment of Asthma Care Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  To address the large discrepancy between consensus quality standards and healthcare services actually delivered to those eligible, the Institute of Medicine has called for new quality initiatives and has identified asthma as one if its priority areas. Each year, thousands of preventable deaths are attributed to asthma. The asthma-related health burden is especially pronounced in vulnerable populations. Opportunities to improve asthma care quality hinge on the capacity to comprehensively and routinely assess the care that is actually delivered to asthma patients. Current quality measurement studies require extensive clinical chart review and are not cost-effective on a public health scale. Healthcare information technology (Health IT) could have a big impact by enabling automated quality assessments. Electronic medical record (EMR) systems capture clinical information that could make comprehensive, cost effective quality assessment possible. However, much relevant information (and perhaps 50% or more of the necessary data) resides in free-text clinical notes, which presents a significant challenge to automated quality assessment. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient asthma care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of EMR data from two distinct health systems: a mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (Oregon Community Health Information Network) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the Pacific Northwest. This project leverages Health IT to assess and improve quality of care for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We propose to use an outpatient Asthma Care Quality (ACQ) measure set derived from the original RAND Quality Assessment Tools Project. We will first refine the ACQ measures using up-to-date clinical guidelines and consensus standards for outpatient diagnosis, treatment and management of asthma in patients older than 5 years. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the MediClass system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify ACQ-relevant clinical events in the electronic medical record. Then, we will apply the ACQ measures to assess current levels of asthma care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the association between ACQ measures of recommended asthma care and actual clinical outcomes using extensive longitudinal patient data available at the KPNW study site.          n/a",Automating Assessment of Asthma Care Quality,7355952,R18HS017022,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2007,421424,0.03167058519979674
"Using Absence-Causing Symptoms to Monitor Child Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       On any given weekday, more than one-fifth of the U.S. population is in schools. While we all want schools to be safe places-havens for learning-schoolchildren today face serious health threats including bioterrorism. In the proper project, we will develop and evaluate a system called ASIAN (Absenteeism-causing Symptom-Level Assessment Network), designed to monitor the health of children in schools. Our system focuses on monitoring children's school attendance, because most experts agree that absenteeism from school is an early sign of an outbreak in a community. However, school absenteeism is not a precise sign of an outbreak or epidemic. Absenteeism is often not even related to illness, reflecting, instead, problems in the child's home environment, important social or cultural obligations, and even opportunities for family recreation.

Reading          fluency is necessary for learning from science and social studies texts in           later grades. The objectives of the proposal is to investigate the development       of fluency and automaticity in early elementary school reading. The research         will refine existing programs for the development of fluent reading in               classrooms and remedial reading settings.  The study has three goals: (a) to         develop and validate pedagogical approaches to developing reading fluency,           specifically repeated reading and wide reading approaches; (b) to determine          the effectiveness of approaches to providing remedial support for                    low-achieving children including decoding instruction, speeded word                  identification strategies, and repeated reading strategies; (c) to develop an        empirically-based model of the development of fluency in beginning readers,          particularly obligatoriness, speed, and resource availability aspects of             fluent reading.

"Determinants of Behavior Problems after Divorce  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processes responsible for the association between divorce and adjustment in adults and their offspring are not well understood. The higher rates of behavioral and psychological problems in adults and children from divorced families were originally considered to be consequences of marital disruption, but may also reflect nonrandom selection of families into divorce. In order to disentangle these processes, the proposed research will utilize data from a longitudinal study of Australian adult twins and their offspring. First, analyses of monozygotic and dizygotic adult twins discordant for divorce will examine how genetic and environmental processes account for the increased problems among divorced individuals. Second, the children of twins design will investigate the causal and selection factors responsible for the relation between marital dissolution and functioning in young-adult offspring. Third, the proposed analyses will assess how family and individual characteristics mediate the environmental and genetic influences associated with offspring's adjustment to their parents' divorce. Finally, training opportunities will provide the opportunity to explore whether the family environment controls genetic expression of offspring behavior problems, use longitudinal data to study developmental changes in children's response to family conflict, and employ decision tree analyses to study how multiple risk and protective factors interact to influence child development. The proposed research seeks to move beyond simple associations between familial characteristics and outcomes and elucidate causal mechanisms by utilizing genetically informative designs, longitudinal data, and advanced quantitative methods.   n/a",Determinants of Behavior Problems after Divorce,6656262,F31MH067300,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' behavioral genetics', ' clinical research', ' conflict', ' developmental psychology', ' divorce /separation', ' family structure /dynamics', ' functional ability', ' gene environment interaction', ' human data', ' longitudinal human study', ' parent offspring interaction', ' personality', ' predoctoral investigator', ' psychological adaptation', ' psychological stressor', ' social behavior', ' socioenvironment', ' twin /multiplet']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,F31,2003,25481,0.002536088961599573

In the first aim, the       candidate proposes to build on an existing set of computer-based clinical        problem solving cases to construct a comprehensive set of cases that can be      used to determine the comprehension of childhood asthma across a broad set       of audiences.  The second aim is to employ artificial neural networks to         evaluate performance on the computerized cases.  The third aim involves          implementing the computer-based cases and the neural network performance         model in three settings:  physicians in training, nursing and nurse              practitioner students, and asthma patients in the community.  To a lesser        extent physician experts will be evaluated with the system.  To achieve          these aims the candidate has garnered the help of faculty in the School of       Nursing, the Department of Medicine, and prominent members of the                educational community in Los Angeles.

"Determinants of Behavior Problems after Divorce  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processes responsible for the association between divorce and adjustment in adults and their offspring are not well understood. The higher rates of behavioral and psychological problems in adults and children from divorced families were originally considered to be consequences of marital disruption, but may also reflect nonrandom selection of families into divorce. In order to disentangle these processes, the proposed research will utilize data from a longitudinal study of Australian adult twins and their offspring. First, analyses of monozygotic and dizygotic adult twins discordant for divorce will examine how genetic and environmental processes account for the increased problems among divorced individuals. Second, the children of twins design will investigate the causal and selection factors responsible for the relation between marital dissolution and functioning in young-adult offspring. Third, the proposed analyses will assess how family and individual characteristics mediate the environmental and genetic influences associated with offspring's adjustment to their parents' divorce. Finally, training opportunities will provide the opportunity to explore whether the family environment controls genetic expression of offspring behavior problems, use longitudinal data to study developmental changes in children's response to family conflict, and employ decision tree analyses to study how multiple risk and protective factors interact to influence child development. The proposed research seeks to move beyond simple associations between familial characteristics and outcomes and elucidate causal mechanisms by utilizing genetically informative designs, longitudinal data, and advanced quantitative methods.   n/a",Determinants of Behavior Problems after Divorce,6582861,F31MH067300,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' behavioral genetics', ' clinical research', ' conflict', ' developmental psychology', ' divorce /separation', ' family structure /dynamics', ' functional ability', ' gene environment interaction', ' human data', ' longitudinal human study', ' parent offspring interaction', ' personality', ' predoctoral investigator', ' psychological adaptation', ' psychological stressor', ' social behavior', ' socioenvironment', ' twin /multiplet']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,F31,2002,23885,0.002536088961599573

"AUTOMATED SYSTEM FOR TELEPHONIC MGMT OF ASTHMA Asthma is a highly prevalent disease with a significant morbidity                leading to emergency room visits, hospitalizations and absenteeism from          work and school. Two major factors contributing to asthma morbidity (and         mortality) are failure to detect asthma decompensation and use of                inappropriate treatment strategies. Asthma severity can be assessed by           clinical symptoms and peak flow measurements. There are internationally          accepted guidelines for asthma management. However, rapid translation            of asthma symptoms into a change in therapy is frequently impeded by the         patient's inability to understand self management, reluctance to contact         the health care provider, or delays in feedback from the provider to the         patient. The objective of the proposal is to develop and clinically              evaluate a new Automated System for Telephonic Home Management of                Asthma.                                                                                                                                                           We describe the design and alpha testing of a dynamic relational                 database (DRdb) suitable for use either in a isolated PC or in a                 distributed computer system to support daily reporting and facilitate            all provider monitoring. The resulting DRdb accepts information about            the patient, their specific diagnoses and treatment regimens. Each DRdb          is accessible on-line, linked through LAN or WAN and captures the                patient's symptoms and measurements at the moment when they are                  reported. Because the patient's history is electronically available, the         DRdb can dynamically support the health professional to relay                    instructions immediately. Generally these instructions are pre-defined           by the patient's doctor for the reported symptom set. Automation of              these procedures may be possible.                                                                                                                                 Specifically, we are developing a custom telephone interface, conducting         a clinical trial in both adult and pediatric populations in which asthma         management is under constant physician direction and where asthma                intervention is (I) computer-assisted, (II) computer-mediated, or (III)          according to conventional methods (Control Group). We measure end-points         relevant to disease managers(costs), to health care providers(time) and          to asthmatic patients(respiratory outcomes). The goals of the Asthma             system described in this proposal are to save time (efficacy), and               increase patient and health care provider satisfaction (attractiveness).

The development of fluency in children in these classrooms will be           measured through standardized and experimental methods both immediately              following the intervention and a year later, and these children will be              compared to the development of fluency in children receiving a traditional           reading instruction. Effective methods will be implemented and disseminated.         Strand 2 will examine remedial aspects of reading instruction designed to            promote the development of fluent and automatic reading in struggling readers.       This strand will examine the effectiveness of both Phonological and Strategy         Training, Speeded Word Retrieval, and Repeated Reading strategies, both singly       and in combination. The effectiveness of these will be compared to a                 traditional remedial instruction control. Both immediate and long term               follow-up measures, on both standardized achievement and experimental                measures, will be conducted to follow the progress of these children. Strand 3       will examine how the aspects associated with automatic reading:                      obligatoriness, speed, and resource availability change together during the          development of fluent reading during the second grade. Both a cross-sectional        and two-year longitudinal study are planned. By examining all of these aspects       together in a single longitudinal study, a richer description and theoretical        base for the development of fluent reading skill will be obtained. This strand       will also develop the experimental measures of reading fluency to be used in         the other strands, The research conducted will add valuable knowledge                regarding the ways to foster fluent automatic reading in young elementary            school children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               n/a",THE DEVELOPMENT OF FLUENT AND AUTOMATIC READING,6344385,R01HD040746,"['academic achievement', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted instruction', ' education evaluation /planning', ' educational resource design /development', ' elementary school', ' human subject', ' information dissemination', ' interview', ' longitudinal human study', ' mathematical model', ' middle childhood (6-11)', ' model design /development', ' phonology', ' reading disorder', ' remedial /special education', ' rural area', ' speech', ' teacher', ' training', ' urban poverty area']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA (UGA),R01,2000,1083286,0.02557999284104566
"Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare Project Summary There is a sharp and increasing imbalance between the number of children with autism in need of care and the availability of specialists certified to treat the disorder in its multi-faceted manifestations. The autism community faces a dual clinical challenge: how to direct scarce specialist resources to service the diverse array of phenomes and how to monitor and validate best practices in treatment. Clinicians must now look to solutions that scale in a decentralized fashion, placing data capture, remote monitoring, and therapy increasingly into the hands of families. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and large amounts of labeled human emotion computer vision data, we have developed a solution for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glasses and Android smartphones to deliver real time social cues to individuals with autism in the child’s natural environment. We hypothesize that this informatic system can provide real-time therapy in a way that scales to meet the demand of the growing population of autism families, including underserved minorities, while growing data that can be used to measure progress over time and in the development of novel AI. Our first aim will focus on the development of a deep learning model that enables dynamic emotion recognition in the real world, and on domain adaptation procedures that enable minimal manual labeling to personalize the model for optimal accuracy on the individuals with whom the child will interact most regularly at home. Our second aim will focus on the human computer interface, namely the design of the user experience with the Android application that controls the sessions run on the Google Glass wearable. We will work our clinical colleagues and with groups of autism families to develop and enhance a set of games and activity modes that create social engagements ideal for emotion therapy, including an emotion capture and a charades game. The third aim will test our central hypothesis that the Glass system can create a therapy-to-data feedback loop that delivers clinical care while growing data for measurement and model development. We will work with up to 200 children ages 4-8 who have recent autism diagnoses and do not have access to standard behavioral therapy. We will build a community of autism families through crowdsourcing techniques, befitting the mobile paradigm embodied by our work, and through close collaboration with behavioral therapy providers, the autism outreach organization Autism Speaks, and the digital healthcare company, Cognoa. The families will work with us on design and refinement of our “Superpower Glass” system for fit, engagement, and function of use for both therapy and data capture. Importantly, we will send units home with families to use the device for at least 3 twenty-minute sessions per week for a minimum of 6 weeks. This remote period will generate a massive database to quantify overall social learning, emotion comprehension, eye contact, and sustained social acuity. In all, our work program will show that mobile wearable AI can bring the social learning process out of the clinic and into the real world for faster and more adaptive intervention. Project Narrative There is a sharp and growing imbalance between the number of clinical care providers available and the number of children with an autism diagnosis that leave most children without therapy until after critical periods in development have passed. We intend to address this problem through creation of a machine learning-enabled wearable that brings effective care to the home and empowers both parents, patients, and clinicians with mobile solutions that personalize care delivery to dramatically improve children’s outcomes. The Superpower Glass system, which delivers social cues to children during real-time interactions and provides several engagement modes for families, is a promising solution that enables greater access to care for families across the US, and potentially, across the globe.!",Creating an artificial intelligence therapy-to-data feedback loop for child developmental healthcare,9936445,R01LM013083,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Support', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Self-Direction', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Variant', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'applied behavior analysis', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'combat', 'critical period', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'model development', 'novel', 'outreach', 'personalized care', 'phenome', 'practical application', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'underserved minority', 'user-friendly']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,664314,-0.024283058281462717
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Clinical Deterioration in Hospitalized Children PROJECT SUMMARY Children who are admitted to the hospital and experience deterioration have a high risk of mortality and poor long-term health. Current warning early scores indicating risk of deterioration are subjectively derived and have not reduced in-hospital mortality. In recent work, I developed a vital sign based statistical model that demonstrated improved accuracy over current risk scores at predicting clinical deterioration in hospitalized children 24 hours in advance. Within adults, the combination of longitudinal data analysis techniques, machine learning, and electronic health record (EHR) data have led to highly accurate early warning scores. Therefore, my aim in this grant proposal is to utilize longitudinal integration of EHR data in a machine learning framework to develop a model for predicting clinical deterioration in hospitalized children as early as possible. I will do this by first deriving and validating a prediction model using structured EHR data collected from three pediatric hospitals (Aim 1). Using the same cohort, I will then build and validate a prediction model using features derived from unstructured clinical notes (Aim 2). I will also compare if the addition of unstructured features improves the prediction accuracy of the model derived in Aim 1. Finally, I will determine the association between non-patient level environmental variables within the hospital ecosystem and risk of clinical deterioration in hospitalized children (Aim 3). I will also determine if the addition of these environmental risk factors improves performance of the prediction model derived through Aims 1 and 2. Completion of this proposal will result in a validated pediatric risk prediction model that will enable clinicians to recognize early signs of deterioration in hospitalized children. This will facilitate timely intervention, thereby saving lives and improving long-term health. In addition, this grant will also provide me with crucial data for a future R01 trial aimed at assessing the impact of the prediction model in reducing mortality, decreasing costs, and improving long-term outcomes in hospitalized children. To establish myself as an independent investigator in pediatric prediction modeling, I propose a training plan that includes comprehensive didactics and mentorship in the areas of longitudinal data analysis, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and concepts in pediatric care. I have assembled a first-class mentorship team comprised of national experts in longitudinal data analysis techniques and EHR-based machine learning (Robert Gibbons PhD and Matthew Churpek MD, PhD). My advisory team is comprised of experts in natural language processing (Dmitriy Dligach PhD), clinical decision support around deterioration events (Dana Edelson MD, MS and Priti Jani MD), and pediatric early warning scores (Christopher Parshuram MB., ChB., D. Phil., FRACP). By completing my research and career development goals, I will develop into an independent expert investigator in developing pediatric prediction models for ultimately improving outcomes in hospitalized children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical deterioration in hospitalized children is associated with high-risk of mortality as well as complications in their long-term health. An improved prediction model capable of identifying pediatric patients at risk of clinical deterioration as early as possible can facility timely and proper intervention, thereby decreasing preventable death and improving long-term outcomes in hospitalized children.",Using Machine Learning to Predict Clinical Deterioration in Hospitalized Children,9969192,K01HL148390,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Intervention', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalized Child', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'control trial', 'cost', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'pediatric patients', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'research and development', 'risk prediction model', 'tool', 'trend', 'unstructured data', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K01,2020,147563,0.01924715004502637
"Mobile bedside ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia in resource limited settings Project Summary In low and middle-income countries (LMICs) pneumonia is by far the leading cause of death among children < 5 years of age. Despite progress in reducing global pneumonia deaths, pneumonia still kills over 1 million children a year. A key factor is the challenge of pneumonia diagnosis. Chest X-Ray is the gold standard for pneumonia diagnoses but exposes children to ionizing radiation and is mainly restricted to hospital settings. Outside of hospitals, pneumonia is diagnosed based on clinical grounds using the WHO’s Integrated Management of Childhood Illness algorithms. However, that approach lacks specificity, resulting in significant overdiagnosis of pneumonia. That wastes precious resources, exposes children to antibiotics unnecessarily, and delays identification of the true cause of a child’s illness. Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in bedside ultrasound as a radiation-sparing alternative to X- Ray. The accuracy of bedside US for diagnosing pneumonia is comparable to X-Ray. However, traditional bedside US suffers the same limitations as X-Rays in terms of portability, and still requires interpretation of images by a trained radiologist. Recent innovations in ultrasound technology and artificial intelligence applications suggest a possible pathway forward. Bluetooth enabled US transponders that connect to a smart phone or tablet, effectively create a truly portable US suite that can fit into one’s pocket. Similarly, advances in artificial intelligence render possible the automated interpretation of mobile bedside US (mBSUS) images on a smart phone, obviating the need for a radiologist. The twin goals of this project are: 1) to compare the accuracy of the mobile, Bluetooth US system, linked to a cell phone, against the gold standard of Chest X-Ray for diagnosis of pneumonia among children aged 1-59 months; and 2) to apply machine learning algorithms to assist in the identification of accurate classification features that reliably identify lobar pneumonia. If successful, this would be a pivotal first step towards the goal of a truly portable yet still highly accurate approach to the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia that could function autonomously without the need for external evaluation by a skilled radiologist. Such a tool would revolutionize pneumonia case management in resource limited parts of the world and could save the lives of many. Project Narrative Pneumonia remains the leading cause of death for children <5 years around the world. A key barrier is the lack of affordable and portable imaging systems.

"Effectiveness and predictors of response for a technology-based reading intervention in the home Project Summary/Abstract. Reading Disability (RD) is the most common learning disability, affecting 10 – 15% of school age children. It incurs major functional impairments at all stages of life, with a wealth of data documenting lifelong disadvantages in educational and occupational attainment. Therefore, identifying effective and affordable treatments for RD is a high priority for reading researchers, clinicians and educators. Problematically, current evidence-based reading interventions largely rely on services by trained specialists, either in well-resourced classrooms or clinical settings. As such, under-resourced schools (or countries) often are unable to provide reading interventions for their students. In recent years, technology-based reading interventions have been proposed as a means of overcoming these challenges, as they can be administered in the home, without direct expert supervision - thereby minimizing resource demands. In the area of reading-focused EdTech, GraphoLearn has emerged as a leader, with the largest evidence-base to date. However, the vast majority of studies to date have been conducted in highly controlled settings, rather than the home environment it was intended for – leaving open questions about effectiveness. Additionally, similar to any intervention, not all children with RD benefit equally from treatment; however little attention has been given to identifying predictors of treatment response. Here we propose to evaluate the effectiveness of home-administered GraphoLearn through the implementation of a large-scale, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 450 reading disabled children (boys and girls, ages 6.0- 10.0). To accomplish this goal rapidly and with minimal cost, we will recruit participants from the Healthy Brain Network [HBN], an ongoing study of mental health and learning disorders in children, ages 5.0-21.0, whose family have concerns about behavior and/or learning (target n = 10,000; current n = 3000+). The availability of comprehensive characterizations (e.g., demographic, cognitive, mental health, EEG, multimodal MRI) for all HBN participants makes the sample optimal for exploring an extensive set of participant and environmental factors that may affect treatment outcomes (i.e., demographic, cognitive, emotional, neurobiological, environmental). Specific aims of the proposed work are to: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of GraphoLearn in a large sample of children with RD, and 2) Identify participant-related and environment-level factors that are significantly associated with GraphoLearn outcomes. To accomplish this latter aim, sophisticated machine learning approaches (Random Forest Regression models) will be employed. Project Narrative This project is motivated by two significant overarching problems (1) existing avenues for reading intervention in the US are not available to most children in need of help, and (2) across children there is substantial variability in pre-to-post intervention gains in reading. This project will evaluate the effectiveness of a home delivered technology-based (Edtech) reading intervention in a large and diverse sample of children, and identify factors that facilitate (or hinder) positive Edtech intervention outcomes.",Effectiveness and predictors of response for a technology-based reading intervention in the home,10058660,R01HD101842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Country', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Children', 'Disadvantaged', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Learning Disorders', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Matched Group', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reading Disabilities', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Work', 'active control', 'base', 'boys', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'dosage', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'functional disability', 'girls', 'intervention effect', 'language impairment', 'multimodality', 'phonology', 'post intervention', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'random forest', 'remediation', 'response', 'skills', 'sound']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2020,688574,0.02492739137552461
"Using Big Data to Understand Sepsis in an Immunocompromised Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Through this proposal, I will develop and evaluate a sepsis prediction tool targeted to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Allogeneic HCT recipients are an immunocompromised population that is disproportionately affected by sepsis, a life-threatening dysregulated immunologic response to an infection. While it is well established that early detection and treatment of sepsis with fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics reduce the risk of mortality, recent data suggests early broad-spectrum antibiotic use in allogeneic HCT recipients may have microbiota-mediated detrimental effects on morbidity and mortality. Because of the risks associated with both missed and falsely identified sepsis events among allogeneic HCT recipients, early and accurate sepsis diagnosis is crucial. However, sepsis is generally challenging to diagnose and is made more complicated in allogeneic HCT recipients by the fact that sepsis presents differently following transplantation and common complications of the transplant procedure present like sepsis. In previous work, we demonstrated that current sepsis clinical criteria have low predictive value among allogeneic HCT recipients and concluded that population specific prediction tools are needed. Recently developed single algorithm, machine learning sepsis prediction tools have shown promising results in general, immuno-competent populations. However, few studies have tested the ability of machine learning workflows to predict sepsis in high-risk, immunocompromised patients, such as allogeneic HCT recipients. Additionally, current sepsis prediction tools rely on the assumption that the true relationship between the predictors and the outcome is contained within a single algorithm. This proposed work has two main objectives. The first is to develop an automated sepsis prediction tool for allogeneic HCT recipients using a state-of-the-art ensemble-based machine learning workflow (the super learner) that relaxes the single algorithm assumption of current sepsis prediction tools. The second is to estimate the utility of this tool in comparison to currently available tools in both traditional (accuracy methods) and novel ways (mathematical modeling of health outcomes). Both aims will be completed with the ultimate goal of improving sepsis prediction among allogeneic HCT recipients and in such, reducing sepsis related mortality and inappropriate antibiotic use among this hard to diagnose population. Further, this research will advance the methodological discussion around the usefulness of machine learning prediction tools in clinical practice and the use of ensemble modeling for prediction of rare, high-case fatality diseases. Such advances have the potential to improve the prediction of health outcomes beyond sepsis and reduce the burden of treatable diseases among immunocompromised populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis is a life-threatening dysregulated host response to an infection that disproportionately affects allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Early detection and appropriate antibiotic therapy have been shown to reduce the risk of mortality in patients with sepsis, but clinical criteria currently recommended in sepsis detection have poor predictive value among HCT recipients. This project consists of the development of an automated, population-specific sepsis diagnostic tool and an estimate of the health implications of tool implementation.",Using Big Data to Understand Sepsis in an Immunocompromised Population,10064529,F31HL154509,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allogenic', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Streptococcus', 'System', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cancer care', 'clinical practice', 'data cleaning', 'hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'neural network', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'random forest', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2020,45082,0.04311443310447551
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination  Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in costs in the US. The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and determine which subgroups of patients benefit most from early and more aggressive interventions. This work will result in novel algorithms to identify high-risk infected patients that can be implemented in the electronic health record to decrease preventable death.",Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination  Study (SEPSIS),9904745,R01GM123193,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Area', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Arrest', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Immune response', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Lighting', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'cost', 'electronic data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'physically handicapped', 'preventable death', 'random forest', 'response', 'septic patients', 'side effect', 'tool', 'ward']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,331866,0.012910780067592071
"Characterizing patients at risk for sepsis through Big Data Characterizing Patients at Risk for Sepsis Through Big Data SUMMARY The goal of this KL2 research proposal is create an extension of an existing data-driven sepsis algorithm, the artificial intelligence sepsis expert (AISE), by forecasting the type and sequence of sepsis-specific organ failure using clinical data from the electronic medical record, then identifying the incremental benefit received by adding high-resolution data derived from cardiovascular waveforms (arterial waveform and electrocardiographic waves), and small molecule metabolite data over time to provide some mechanistic context. The most important data (features) used in real-time from AISE will be used as inputs for a fuzzy k- means clustering algorithm (“Saving Organs from Sepsis”, or SOS) using retrospectively-collected data, designed to better characterize patients at risk for sepsis by their organ failure. I have selected three organs in particular: shock, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI). Principal component analyses (PCA) data from 2,375 ICU patients with sepsis will be projected onto a novel visual representation for patient phenotyping based on risk of (trajectory toward) different types of organ failure. I will identify if this SOS algorithm can accurately forecast new organ failure within 12 hours based on SOS. To better understand the impact of specific features on organ failure, I will test the ability of each high- resolution features, and metabolomics data to forecast septic shock. Among those who develop septic shock, I will measure all nine high-resolution features from the beginning of the ICU stay up to shock onset and compare those changes to those who develop sepsis but not septic shock, and those who do not develop sepsis. I will then see if the collective addition of high-resolution data improves performance of septic shock forecasting. Finally, I will conduct a prospective observational study to collect metabolomic information in a 60- patient study to identify the incremental improvement of adding metabolomics data to SOS for predicting septic shock, over SOS with just EMR and waveform data. The results of this work will provide preliminary data for further career development and NIH-funding. The long-term goal would be to build a model that optimizes the timing of appropriate therapy, thus decreasing the incidence of sepsis and associated organ failure. As a K23 candidate, I will use this award to acquire formal didactic training and more hands-on experience in machine learning, signal processing, metabolomics analysis. I will seek focused training that will complement my experience as a clinical trialist so that I can design high-quality studies to contribute to Big Data analytics in critical care research and practice. My overarching career goal is to become a leader in the application of Big Data analysis of critically ill patients to predict progression of disease, specifically sepsis. The Emory environment is an ideal place to develop these capabilities. Emory Healthcare houses over 200 medical, surgical, and subspecialty ICU beds, many of which are “wired” to store streaming data. In addition to the physical resources, my development will be enhanced by my superb mentorship team, led by Dr. Greg Martin. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis, the body’s response to a life-threatening infection that causes damage to itself, is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and around the world, and failure of vital organs is one of the biggest contributors. This project is designed to predict organ failure specific to sepsis using cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology using readily-available information, and experimental blood tests. The goal is to one day prevent sepsis from happening before it can do permanent, life-threatening damage to patients.",Characterizing patients at risk for sepsis through Big Data,9953611,K23GM137182,"['Acetylcarnitine', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Algorithms', 'Arginine', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Beds', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Citrulline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Endothelium', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Fatty Change', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kynurenine', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Lysophosphatidylcholines', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'N,N-dimethylarginine', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Prospective cohort', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Science', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Shock', 'Son of Sevenless Proteins', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Troponin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'Work', 'amino acid metabolism', 'base', 'blood pressure variability', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data streams', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'experience', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'improved', 'inorganic phosphate', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'specific biomarkers']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,175768,0.02114522443771644
"Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data, Modeling, and Coordination Center (DMCC) for the NHLBI's Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network. The objective of PrecISE is to conduct sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials with precision interventions in stratified patient with severe asthma populations. Patients with severe asthma are heterogeneous, and thus a hard to treat population. Precision medicine interventions, which focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients instead of the best treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this complex patient population. The PrecISE Network is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating Clinical Center investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for PrecISE trials. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include PrecISE information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other key features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to PrecISE by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the PrecISE Network. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for the execution of high-impact, sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials in the PrecISE Network, which can lead to the establishment of potential personalized treatment approaches for patients with severe and/or exacerbation-prone asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe asthma affects 10% of people worldwide, and despite currently available treatments, asthma remains poorly controlled for many patients. The National Institutes of Health is funding a new iteration of previous high- impact asthma clinical trials networks, which will take a personalized medicine approach to identify new therapies for severe asthma, tailored to an individual patient using data-based treatment algorithms that leverage information on his/her individual disease and treatment history. Our proposal is to provide leadership and statistical research support to this network.","Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network",9986880,U24HL138998,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Biometry', 'Calendar', 'Case Report Form', 'Certification', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Files', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Reporting', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Gills', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Online Systems', 'Operations Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Writing', 'asthma exacerbation', 'base', 'clinical center', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'data de-identification', 'data harmonization', 'data management', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'material transfer agreement', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public repository', 'random forest', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2020,13299576,0.04675424901581135
"OBJECTIVE HOME MANAGEMENT OF PEDIATRIC ASTHMA EXACERBATION USING MOBILE TECHNOLOGY AND MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma is the most common chronic pediatric disease in the United States, affecting 6.2 million or 1 in 12 children. Despite advances in the management of childhood asthma, asthma exacerbation results in approximately 550,000 emergency department (ED) visits, 80,000 hospitalizations, and hundreds of premature deaths each year. Early symptoms of asthma exacerbation, especially in children, are nonspecific and are unfortunately often not recognized by parents as asthma until the child demonstrates more severe symptoms, enough to require emergent care. The long-term goal of this STTR initiative is to empower parents to initiate timely therapy for acute asthma by supplementing their subjective assessment with an objective measure of acute asthma severity. The mobile technology we propose to develop, test and deploy toward this goal will use digital signal processing (DSP) and machine learning (ML) to determine three distinct severity zones (corresponding to the green, yellow and red zones on the asthma action plan) allowing parents to follow asthma action plans accurately. The resulting improved and timely home-based management of childhood asthma should reduce current excessive ED utilization and unacceptably high rates of morbidity and mortality. The proposed technology is inspired by and based on the pediatric asthma severity score (PASS). PASS is used in many pediatric EDs for objective assessment of acute asthma severity to aid management of acute asthma and critical discharge and hospitalization decisions. The components of PASS are five well-studied and validated clinical parameters. Our goal in the proposed project is to develop new technology that enables parents to make similar measurements in the home setting and map those to the 3 color-coded zones for easier execution of asthma action plans. The 2 specific aims of the project are to 1) build a pediatric asthma database with ground-truth clinical findings, and 2) develop and validate DSP and ML algorithms for automated assessment of acute asthma severity. The successful completion of these aims will result in a validated technology suitable for objective, home-based assessment of acute asthma severity. Such assessment is currently possible but only in medical facilities by trained medical staff. Our Phase II goals will be to (a) further improve and deploy the technology in homes and (b) conduct a prospective trial measuring its feasibility, utilization and effectiveness in controlling asthma emergencies and costs. In Phase II, we will also pursue the necessary regulatory approvals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children associated with high rates of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and premature deaths. These problems exist because families find it difficult to recognize the symptoms of asthma. The goal of this project is to develop novel technology suitable for home use that will make recognizing the symptoms of asthma easier, leading to timely administration of medication and avoidance of serious complications.",OBJECTIVE HOME MANAGEMENT OF PEDIATRIC ASTHMA EXACERBATION USING MOBILE TECHNOLOGY AND MACHINE LEARNING,10010457,R41NR019735,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Auscultation', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergent care', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Staff', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oxygen', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Research', 'Respiratory Sounds', 'Severities', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Speech', 'Stethoscopes', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wheezing', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work of Breathing', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic patient', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'digital', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication administration', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pediatric emergency', 'premature', 'prospective', 'respiratory']",NINR,"AUSCULTECH DX, LLC",R41,2020,257878,0.12155322477530933
"Automatic Rib Fracture Detection in Pediatric Radiography to Identify Non-Accidental Trauma ABSTRACT Automatic Rib Fracture Detection in Pediatric Radiography to Identify Non-Accidental Trauma PI: Adam M. Alessio Non-accidental trauma caused by physical abuse is a leading cause of death in children in the United States. Because rib fractures are highly predictive of child abuse and chest radiographs are commonly performed for multiple indications, pediatric chest radiographs can have a critical role in the identification of abuse. Detection of rib fractures on pediatric radiographs is challenging and a high percentage of fractures are missed, particularly in imaging centers with limited pediatric radiology experience. Currently, there are no viable computer assisted strategies for rib fracture detection on chest radiographs. The purpose of this proposal is to develop machine learning methodology to detect rib fractures on pediatric radiographs using images from a network of hospitals. These methods will rely on a two-stage approach including a thoracic cavity segmentation stage followed by a fracture detection stage. We will explore two fracture detection strategies using novel supervised learning approaches: a heterogeneous U-net and a multi-modal regional-convolutional neural network. These methods will be trained and tested with a large set of fracture-absent radiographs (N=1000) from Seattle Children's Hospital and a diverse set of labelled fracture-present radiographs (N=500) from collaborating sites. These methods will be developed with an intentionally diverse set of radiographs, representative of the variety of fracture presentations and image quality in clinical practice, in order to position this rib fracture detection method for rapid translation to clinical practice. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to provide a computer assisted rib fracture assessment tool that would be a rapid and widely-available add-on to all pediatric chest radiograph exams, improving detection of rib fractures and potentially leading to improved identification of child abuse. NARRATIVE Automatic Rib Fracture Detection in Pediatric Radiography to Identify Non-Accidental Trauma PI: Adam M. Alessio Child abuse is a leading cause of death in children and rates of abuse are increasing. Detection of rib fractures on commonly performed chest radiographs has the potential to identify unsuspected child abuse, but it is very challenging to see fractures on these exams.

"A New Tool to Rapidly Diagnose Sepsis using Flow Imaging Microscopy and Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is a serious condition induced by an infection, often by a bacterial pathogen, leading to organ damage or even death. Despite numerous advances in medicine over the years, the condition still affects millions of people in both developed and developing countries. In the US, sepsis affects 1.7M and kills over 265,000 people annually. Sepsis mortality rates in developing countries are substantially higher. In terms of demographics, sepsis affects humans of all age and race, but it is most pronounced at the age extremes (infants and the elderly) and patients whose immune system is already under strain due to other illnesses or immune system-weakening therapies, e.g., cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.  Blood cultures are currently the default technique used in detecting and diagnosing the root cause of sepsis. However, blood-cultures can take upwards of 24-48 hours in order to obtain results. In that time, the patient can experience irreversible harm due to the condition if not treated properly. Unfortunately, precise and effective antibiotic treatment requires knowledge of the pathogen causing sepsis. Beyond a long time to get an answer, blood cultures often exhibit alarmingly high false negatives (failure to detect a pathogen causing sepsis) and typically do not precisely identify the pathogen causing sepsis.  Hence there have been several efforts aimed at detecting and identifying the broad range of potential pathogens causing sepsis and circumventing the need for blood cultures. However, many of the recently proposed methods for detecting and diagnosing sepsis exhibit one or more of the following drawbacks: (i) they lack high sensitivity (ability to detect a pathogen); (ii) they cannot accurately identify a broad range of pathogens from a single sam- ple; (iii) take a (relatively) long time; (iv) require a large volume of blood; or (v) cannot be used in the real-time monitoring of sepsis (either detecting pathogens known to cause sepsis or quantifying the patient's response to antimicrobial treatment).  We are proposing a new sepsis detection method, combining ﬂow imaging microscopy (a high-throughput technique for imaging millions of microscopic particles) and deep learning based image analysis (techniques leveraged in facial recognition and self-driving cars) to overcome the above mentioned limitations. The approach has proven capable of detecting a variety of bacterial species in low concentrations of mouse blood in less than 1 hour of processing time with as little as 50 L of blood. In this proposal, one of our aims is to optimize our approach and quantify the accuracy and limits of detection in human blood. Our patent pending approach has also been licensed to a major manufacturer of ﬂow imaging microscopes. Another aim of this research is to begin integration of our technology with an existing commercial instrument with the intention of providing a compact self- contained device that can be deployed at numerous hospitals world-wide. The implementation of our platform should have a major impact on antimicrobial treatment in all areas of the hospital. Project Narrative  Sepsis affects 1.7M US citizens (causing roughly 270k deaths) each year; the condition is also the most expensive condition treated in US hospitals costing approximately 24B USD each year. Current methods for detecting and determining the source of the infection causing sepsis are inaccurate, too slow, and do not provide detailed pathogen speciﬁc information needed for effective treatment. Our proposal aims at developing a fast approach, combining ﬂow imaging microscopy and deep learning, for detecting and determining the root cause of sepsis from blood samples (addressing many issues facing sepsis detection and diagnosis) which can deployed at a variety of hospitals worldwide.",A New Tool to Rapidly Diagnose Sepsis using Flow Imaging Microscopy and Machine Learning,10078833,R43EB029863,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bedside Testings', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification Scheme', 'Colony-forming units', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Systems', 'Culture Techniques', 'DNA', 'Detection', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infection', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Length of Stay', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Premature Birth', 'Preparation', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'age group', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'detector', 'digital imaging', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'human DNA', 'human old age (65+)', 'image processing', 'improved', 'infant death', 'instrument', 'intrapartum', 'microscopic imaging', 'mortality', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'nano', 'nanoproducts', 'neonatal sepsis', 'older patient', 'optic flow', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient response', 'point of care', 'preterm newborn', 'processing speed', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'real time monitoring', 'side effect', 'tool']",NIBIB,"URSA ANALYTICS, INC.",R43,2020,112402,0.019955650679354665
"Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings Abstract Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare resources. Treatment of diarrhea is mostly empiric, with antibiotic use mostly based on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from antibiotic use, and inappropriate use leads to toxicity and resistance. Furthermore, despite the increasing availability of rapid molecular testing, there is little data to base a decision of whom or when to test. Our overarching goal is to develop and validate clinical decision tools for management of diarrheal illnesses in children of both high and low resource settings. We will utilize prospectively-collected data from two recently-completed multicenter cohort studies of pediatric diarrhea. These studies feature extensive etiologic testing, well-characterized clinical elements, and longitudinal outcome data. We have assembled a team with expertise in pediatric diarrhea, clinical prediction rules, and machine learning methods. In Aim 1, we will use domestic data to develop and validate: a) a score for bacterial etiology, and b) a score for which patients are likely to benefit from further testing. We will derive the scores using data from IMPACT, an NIH-sponsored study of 1200 children from 5 US Emergency Departments, and validate using electronic health records from the Utah Intermountain Health System. In Aim 2, we will use international data to develop and validate: a) a diagnostic score for bacterial etiology, and b) a prognostic score for risk stratification of children who go on to poor outcomes. We will derive the scores using data from GEMS, a study of over 9400 children across 7 low-resource countries, and validate using VIDA study of children in 3 African countries. Completion of the Aims will result in the availability of a number of clinical tools that healthcare workers worldwide can use for evidence-based care of children with diarrhea. Project Narrative Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The management of childhood diarrhea often depend on what type of pathogen is responsible, but in many cases testing is not affordable or feasible. We propose studies to develop clinical scores to make it easier for healthcare workers to decide how to manage children with diarrhea.",Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings,9912093,R01AI135114,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Africa', 'African', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Case Management', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Enteral', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Income', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sample Size', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Utah', 'Vaccines', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical diagnostics', 'diarrheal disease', 'evidence base', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'machine learning method', 'microbial', 'molecular diagnostics', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,397159,0.05525216187229451
"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,9949789,R01MH104030,"['Advertisements', 'Age', 'Anniversary', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'brain abnormalities', 'caudate nucleus', 'comparison group', 'critical period', 'dexterity', 'follow-up', 'habit learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'medical attention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomenological models', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'secondary analysis', 'support vector machine', 'tic suppression', 'vector']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,662746,0.026603378336026936
"Multisite Electronic Health Record-based Surveillance of the Burden of Diabetes by Type in Children and Adolescents Diabetes is a common chronic disease in children and adolescents under age of 18 years. In the recent two decades, both the prevalence and incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been increasing considerably among US children and adolescents. T2D now accounts for ~15% of diabetes cases diagnosed in childhood and adolescence. The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study is the only ongoing multisite surveillance study of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents. The SEARCH study is a population-based registry, which is a more expensive, more labor-intensive, and slower surveillance method compared with a surveillance system using electronic health records (EHRs). EHR algorithms have shown great potential in identifying diabetes cases. This study will analyze both structured EHR data (e.g., diagnosis codes, medications, and laboratory results) and unstructured clinical notes. We will apply expert knowledge, machine learning, and natural language processing to develop the best algorithms for identifying prevalent and incident T1D and T2D cases. The primary objective of this study is to establish an EHR-based surveillance system for monitoring the burden of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents. We will collaborate with 3 EHR research networks from the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet), covering ~3 million racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse children and adolescents from 4 states (IL, LA, NY, and TX) in 3 Census regions. The patient populations in this study are roughly representative of the source populations in the catchment areas. The specific aims of this study are 1) to estimate the prevalence of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region in 2019; 2) to estimate the incidence of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region in 2019; 3) to estimate 10-year trends in the prevalence and incidence of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region, 2014-2023; and 4) to compare the prevalence and incidence of diabetes by type, as well as temporal trends, in US children and adolescents with those in children and adolescents from other countries and regions. This study is innovative because it will leverage EHRs for surveillance (more efficient and cost-effective than registries and surveys), use advanced statistical approaches (e.g., machine learning and natural language processing), estimate a denominator using patient zip codes, build flexibility into the surveillance methods according to local availability of clinical notes, and use a 2-staged sampling approach to improve chart review efficiency. All 4 states in this study do not have an active diabetes surveillance system for children and adolescents and are not covered by the SEARCH study. This study will advance our understanding of the geographic, age, sex, and racial/ethnic differences in the burden of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents. The obtained surveillance data will help identify and prioritize subpopulations for prevention of diabetes and related comorbidities to reduce health disparities. The burden of type 1 and type 2 diabetes has been increasing considerably among US children and adolescents. A population-based registry, which is expensive and labor-intensive, has provided estimates for the prevalence and incidence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents from limited geographic regions in the US. This study will build an efficient and cost-effective multisite surveillance system using electronic health records covering several other geographic regions, to estimate the prevalence, incidence, and trends of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in US children and adolescents according to age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region.",Multisite Electronic Health Record-based Surveillance of the Burden of Diabetes by Type in Children and Adolescents,10085447,U18DP006503,[' '],NCCDPHP,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,U18,2020,250000,-0.04035481664184864
"Validation of Physiologic CPR Quality Using NOn-inVasive Waveform Analytics (CPR-NOVA) Project Abstract  Pediatric cardiac arrest affects thousands of children each year. Progressive heart and lung failure is a predisposing cause in many of these events. Despite improvements in survival outcomes over the past two decades, more than half of these children still do not survive. As new brain injury complicates care among survivors, the burden to these children and the public's health is substantial.  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) – the medical procedure of providing chest compressions and ventilations during cardiac arrest – saves lives, and higher quality CPR is more effective at doing so. One method to improve CPR quality is through the use of CPR quality monitoring defibrillators. By providing real- time feedback on CPR mechanics targets such as chest compression depth and rate, they represent the best patient care option currently available to improve CPR performance. Unfortunately, most of these devices are either not approved for children or use pads that are too large for many pediatric patients. Thus, current technology limits the benefit of meaningful CPR quality monitoring to a small percentage of the children who suffer a cardiac arrest. Given the strong association between pediatric CPR quality and outcomes, new methods to monitor CPR quality are urgently needed to improve the care of this vulnerable population.  Physiologic-directed CPR is a promising technique that uses the hemodynamic response of the patient to guide the ongoing resuscitation effort. This approach overcomes the technological limitations of existing CPR quality monitoring technology by using data from patient monitors. Unfortunately, because many patients do not have intra-arterial lines in place at the time of arrest to guide CPR, its clinical impact has been limited. To overcome this limitation, the objective of this ancillary application is to leverage the existing infrastructure of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-funded Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) and the unique hemodynamic waveform database of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded parent R01 – the ICU-Resuscitation (ICU-RESUS) Project – to validate two noninvasive physiologic CPR monitors applicable to nearly every pediatric cardiac arrest: 1) end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2); and 2) PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) obtained via pulse oximetry. Using sophisticated machine learning methods, a prospective observational analytic investigation is proposed with the following Aims: 1) Evaluate ETCO2 as a noninvasive CPR quality monitor among children receiving at least 1 minute of CPR in a CPCCRN intensive care unit; and 2) Using novel machine learning classification algorithms, evaluate PPG and other candidate physiologic waveforms as noninvasive CPR quality monitors.  By leveraging the substantial infrastructure of the CPCCRN, the novel hemodynamic waveform database of ICU-RESUS, and advanced machine learning analytics, this submission represents a unique opportunity to validate two noninvasive physiologic pediatric CPR quality monitors to improve clinical care and save lives. !

"Secondary use of EMR for residency training in asthma care and documentation PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma is the most common chronic illness among children. In our preliminary study, we discovered significant variations in the volume and quality of clinical documentation on asthma in electronic medical records (EMRs) between pediatric residents and pediatric faculty. For example, although pediatric residents documented much more extensively than the pediatric faculty on asthma-related histories consistent with a diagnosis of asthma, the residents were less likely to make an actual diagnosis of asthma than their faculty counterparts. This variation in documenting asthma-related events in EMRs has two important implications: one is a proficiency issue related to the training of pediatric residents in achieving clinical competence in asthma care and documentation; the other is a data quality issue, which impacts the secondary use of EMR for downstream analyses. At present, little has been reported on the secondary use of EMR for residency training. The primary goal of this proposed study is to develop an informatics tool assessing residents' adherence to asthma guidelines (i.e., competence in asthma care) and documentation variation (i.e., competence in documentation) (Aim 1) and evaluate individual pediatric resident's competence in asthma care and documentation by conducting a population-based birth cohort study (Aim 2). The tool can be utilized to provide “individualized clinical effectiveness data” for residents enhancing their clinical competence in asthma care, as recommended by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). In Aim 1: We will develop an automated informatics tool assessing adherence to asthma guidelines and documentation variation in primary care settings. We will extract the necessary clinical elements from both structured data querying from our database and unstructured data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to assess adherence to guidelines and documentation variation. The performance of element extraction will be assessed against manual chart reviews as gold standard. In Aim 2: We will evaluate clinical competence of pediatric residents in asthma care and asthma diagnosis. We will assess clinical competence in asthma care for children with persistent asthma and examine clinical competence in asthma diagnosis from clinical documentation using the informatics tool developed in Aim 1. Expected outcomes: The proposed research is significant, innovative, and exploratory as little is known about the secondary use of EMR for residency training. If successful, the study results will: a) deliver individualized clinical effectiveness data report to pediatric residents to enhance their clinical training and documentation; and b) provide an informatics tool assessing adherence to asthma care guidelines in clinical practice settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma is the most common chronic illness among children that is frequently evaluated and managed by pediatric residents. No training tools are available that provide individualized feedback on residents' competence in asthma care and documentation from their clinical notes. We address this challenge by developing an automated tool to provide data-driven feedback to individual residents to enhance their competence in asthma care and documentation.",Secondary use of EMR for residency training in asthma care and documentation,9828754,R21AI142702,"['Accreditation', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Competence', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Competence', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'data quality', 'graduate medical education', 'individualized feedback', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'population based', 'practice setting', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'structured data', 'tool', 'unstructured data']",NIAID,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2020,198750,0.10097217526729012
"Biomarker Discovery for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Children Project Abstract Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the aggressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the most common liver disease in children in the United States. The disease affects almost 1/3 of all obese children, estimated to be approximately 7 million children. Treatment is based on lifestyle changes such as a low sugar diet and increasing exercise, but no therapeutics are approved for children or adults. Currently, diagnosis of NASH requires a liver biopsy, which is cumbersome, expensive and has inherent risk. The lack of 1) non-invasive biomarkers to diagnose NASH and 2) pharmacodynamic/response biomarkers of NASH to therapy are considered by many to be an important barrier in the field. These biomarkers are needed to advance clinical care, focusing resources on the children with the most progressive form of the disease. And they are needed to drive therapeutic development because children with NASH are prioritized for participation in clinical trials and response biomarkers for NASH are needed to become surrogate endpoint biomarkers for clinical trials to accelerate drug development. This proposal represents an exceptional multidisciplinary effort to address these important gaps in knowledge. The project will be led by Dr. Miriam Vos, expert in pediatric NAFLD and experienced in early biomarker development research. Co-investigators including Dr. Kristal Maner-Smith, expert in lipidomics and Dr. Ayman Akil, expert in machine learning and biomarker discovery. The team seeks to develop a panel of biomarkers to predict NASH and to reflect response of NASH to therapy through the 2 following aims. Aim 1 will define and validate a panel of metabolites and lipids diagnostic of NASH in children. Aim 2 will define and validate a panel of metabolites, lipids and clinical variables that are associated with treatment induced improvement in NASH. Aims 1 and 2 will both capitalize on the exceptionally high-quality samples available from the NASH clinical research network and deposited within the NIDDK Central Repository. Repository serum samples are available from two pediatric clinical studies including the NAFLD Database study and the TONIC randomized clinical trial and were collected near in time to a liver biopsy as well as with detailed clinical phenotyping. Validation cohort and control samples will be drawn from the Emory Liver Biopsy Biorepository study and an ongoing Healthy Control pediatric cohort at Emory. Preliminary data demonstrates strong associations between specific metabolites and pathologic features of NASH including hepatocyte ballooning, inflammation and steatosis supporting feasibility. These studies are designed to have a sustained, powerful impact on the pediatric NASH biomarker field and to directly improve the health of children through efficient diagnosis of NASH and successful therapeutic development for NASH. Project Narrative This proposal seeks to improve child health through detecting and validating novel biomarkers for pediatric nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, the more progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,9844413,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,352587,-0.029573390187382777
"Identification and characterization of children with asthma-associated comorbidities through computational and immune phenotyping PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma, the most common chronic disease among children, is one of the five most burdensome diseases in the US. While current care and research efforts focus on symptom control and exacerbation risk, children with asthma may suffer from infectious and inflammatory diseases, ie, asthma-associated infectious and inflammatory disease comorbidities (AIICs) (eg, pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster, appendicitis, and celiac disease). Although AIICs pose serious threats to children with asthma, they are largely under-recognized, as evidenced by diabetes mellitus being widely recognized but a less common chronic illness with a magnitude similar to that for asthma. Presently, the mechanisms underlying AIICs are unknown. We postulate immunosenescence might be related, as AIICs coincide with cardinal immunosenescence features. AIICs are not clinically defined and a suitable tool has not been developed to identify children with AIICs. Thus, no strategies mitigating AIICs risks and outcomes exist. Addressing these knowledge gaps depends upon two key questions: (1) “How can asthmatic children subgroups with increased AIICs risk be identified at a population level using electronic medical records?” and (2) “What immune parameters characterize such children?” Answering these is this proposal's primary goal. To this end, our current R01 study successfully developed, validated, and implemented natural language processing (NLP)- empowered computational phenotyping algorithms for two existing criteria for childhood asthma (Predetermined Asthma Criteria, PAC and Asthma Predictive Index, API). NLP-empowered algorithm application to the 1997-2007 Olmsted County Birth Cohort (OCBC) enabled us to profile a subgroup of children with asthma at increased AIICs risk, disproportionately represented by children who met both NLP-PAC and NLP-API. Our new pilot data suggest asthma potentially accelerates immunosenescence leading to AIICs in a subgroup of asthmatic children. In this renewal proposal, we target this subgroup who meet both NLP-PAC and NLP-API. We will develop and apply NLP-empowered computational phenotyping algorithms for AIICs to identify such children at a population level, then characterize their immune parameters measuring immunosenescence. In Aim 1, we will develop new NLP-empowered computational phenotyping algorithms for recognized and unrecognized AIICs (NLP-AIIC) for children enrolled in Mayo Clinic `s 1997-2016 OCBC, then assess portability of NLP-AIIC at Sanford Children's Hospital, Sioux Falls, SD . In Aim 2, we will identify and characterize children with AIICs through new NLP-AIIC and NLP algorithms for asthma status, by utilizing clinical and immune parameters to measure immunosenescence. In Aim 3, we will assess changes (eg, waning adaptive immunity) over time in immune parameters measuring immunosenescence for 300 children in our R01 study, re-enrolling them for further characterization. This proposed study is indispensable to understanding why some children with asthma develop AIICs, while others do not. This knowledge will allow us to identify, manage, mitigate, and improve outcomes for AIICs among children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although asthma is the most common chronic disease among children in the United States, its impact on the risk of serious infections and inflammatory diseases is under-recognized. Presently, it is unknown 1) how to use electronic medical records to identify asthmatic children at increased risks of asthma-associated infectious and inflammatory disease comorbidities (AIICs) and 2) which immune parameters characterize such children. Addressing these two questions is this proposal's primary goal since this knowledge will help us strategize early identification of asthmatic children susceptible to AIICs, eventually mitigate risk of AIICs in children with asthma, and improve patient outcomes.",Identification and characterization of children with asthma-associated comorbidities through computational and immune phenotyping,9851912,R01HL126667,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Appendicitis', 'Asthma', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Birth', 'CD3 Antigens', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Celiac Disease', 'Cell Cycle', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Family history of', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Impairment', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Natural Immunity', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Pneumococcal Pneumonia', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sioux Falls', 'Site', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'United States', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'empowered', 'immunosenescence', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'meetings', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'portability', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'senescence', 'tool']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,806098,0.1066384440513153
"A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors PROJECT ABSTRACT Advances in acute care have decreased short-term mortality of sepsis, resulting in an increasing number of survivors who experience significant morbidity and mortality. Recurrent infections account for 60% of hospital readmissions after sepsis and are an important cause of long-term mortality. Identifying sepsis survivors at risk for infections and understanding predisposing factors are therefore important first steps to develop personalized interventions to improve long-term outcomes. The overall research goal is to develop innovative targeted interventions to improve long-term outcomes after sepsis. This proposal focuses on identifying subgroups of sepsis survivors (phenotypes) at high risk for infection-related hospital readmissions and deaths. It is hypothesized that the combination of host factors, disease characteristics, and interventions prior to and during sepsis will identify distinct phenotypes that are captured by clinical data. These clinical phenotypes likely have distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms (e.g., immunosuppression), predispose to different outcomes (e.g., recurrent infections), and patients with the same phenotype may respond similarly to targeted interventions such as immunomodulation. In Aim 1, three nationally representative datasets of sepsis survivors will be assembled and analyzed by machine learning techniques to identify valid clinical sepsis phenotypes. In Aim 2, phenotypes at high-risk for infection-related readmissions and deaths at 6 months will be identified, and underlying biomarker profiles for these phenotypes analyzed. In Aim 3, these high-risk phenotypes will be used to conceptualize and simulate an adaptive platform trial designed to test the efficacy of three different immunomodulatory drugs. An adaptive trial design was chosen, because it can test multiple interventions simultaneously and reduces the chances of exposing patients to ineffective or harmful interventions. The research plan is augmented by expert mentoring and rigorous didactic training. Together, this will provide the candidate with essential career development skills in the science of precision medicine, including machine learning methodologies, Bayesian statistics, and innovate clinical trial design. This proposal has potentially groundbreaking implications for the future treatment of sepsis survivors, because it deviates from the current “one-size fits all” approach and attempts to create the framework for personalized interventions. This framework sets the stage for future independent investigator (RO1) applications evaluating personalized treatments in adaptive clinical trials, and will uniquely position the candidate as a future leader in the field of long-term outcomes after critical illness. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is important for public health because sepsis is a life-threatening infection that affects 30 million people worldwide each year. Long-term outcomes for patients who survive a hospital admission for sepsis are poor, and many patients develop new disabilities or worsening of preexisting health conditions. This proposal supports the NIH’s mission to enhance health and reduce illness and disability by trying to identify interventions for sepsis survivors at highest risk for poor outcomes.",A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors,9897562,K23GM132688,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Interleukin-7', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Sepsis', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'acute care', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'recurrent infection', 'response', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'trial design']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2020,187984,0.03741072850853936
"Perinatal Origins of Asthma Project Abstract  Early in life many children develop wheezing which can be a sign of early-onset asthma. Yet, not all children who experience wheezing episodes develop asthma. Predicting asthma that begins early in life is important as those who develop early-onset asthma are more likely to have persistent symptoms and structural changes to the lung. Identification and early intervention of high risk individuals could prevent long term lung function abnormalities and provide an alternative to costly treatment. To date, risk prediction models for early- onset asthma are limited mainly to clinical history and presentation. Additionally, no one model contains both reliable sensitivity and specificity or clinically valid serological predictors for early-onset asthma.  Our laboratory has focused previously on immunologic responses to common asthmatic triggers, house dust mite (HMD) and cockroach allergens, between individuals and how these responses differ between populations and outcomes. We have identified increased lymphoproliferation and cytokine response (IL-13) in allergen-stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) derived from individuals who are atopic or African- Americans. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan, stimulate the cytokine production of IL-13 and IFN-γ. In this proposal our preliminary data indicate that the production of IL-13 after allergen exposure in CBMCs is associated with exposure to different microbiota. In addition, early exposure to Moraxellaceae greatly enhances IL-13 production by CBMCs after exposure to HDM. Taken together, our data suggest that early-life bacterial exposure may enhance the production of cytokines that can alter host physiology and immunity.  In this translational medicine proposal, we will build a predictive model for early-onset asthma that will be applicable to general and high risk populations. Our approach will include high-throughput techniques to assess bacterial exposure and immunologic response in the perinatal time period. We will integrate the large amount of data generated into a pipeline with machine learning algorithms that will be regulated specifically for the prediction of later onset of disease. In addition, we will assess bacterial exposure in association with mothers who carry risks for asthma development in their children. The proposed studies will address both the need of predictive model for early-onset asthma and identify bacterial-host interactions associated with high risk populations (e.g. maternal risk factors). Together, these studies form the platform for multidisciplinary training in microbe- immune interactions, predictive risk for asthma, bioinformatics and form a solid foundation to launch a successful career as a physician- scientist. Project Narrative Asthma is the most common chronic disorder of childhood. Early-onset asthma, if left untreated, leads to long term respiratory dysfunction, and currently, no clinical tools reliably aid in prediction of asthma. Therefore, this proposal aims to develop a predictive model for asthma involving microbial and immune interactions that will be applicable to the general and high risk populations.",Perinatal Origins of Asthma,10000960,F30HL136001,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic rhinitis', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Bacterial DNA', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dictyoptera', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemophilus', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Interferon Type II', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mononuclear', 'Moraxella', 'Moraxellaceae', 'Mothers', 'Obesity', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Peptidoglycan', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Pyroglyphidae', 'Recording of previous events', 'Respiration Disorders', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Solid', 'Streptococcus', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States', 'Wheezing', 'airway remodeling', 'asthma model', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'care costs', 'career', 'cockroach allergen', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'individual response', 'machine learning algorithm', 'maternal risk', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiota', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'persistent symptom', 'predictive modeling', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'respiratory colonization', 'respiratory health', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'smoking during pregnancy', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F30,2020,50520,0.08854984363204584
"Sepsis phenotypes at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli: elucidating the impact of sepsis definition and patient case mix on prediction performance PROJECT ABSTRACT Sepsis is a devastating syndrome that represents a leading cause of death, morbidity, and healthcare costs. Its impact is amplified by rising rates of antimicrobial resistance. Improving sepsis outcomes primarily results from prescribing timely antibiotics based on the estimated risk of multidrug resistance (MDR). Previous models grossly overestimated the MDR risk and exacerbated the escalating rates of antimicrobial resistance and excess mortality. The overall goal of this proposed K08 research is to identify common sepsis phenotypes that will enable better prescribing practices and standardized comparisons across hospitals, which will help practicing clinicians, researchers, healthcare institutions, and policy makers. These themes correlate with NIGMS's interest in finding innovative methods and leveraging big data to improve sepsis outcomes. Our three specific aims reflect these goals: (1) establish resistance thresholds for MDR Gram- negative bacilli (GNB) that cause sepsis, (2) assess the impact of sepsis definition on the performance of risk prediction models for MDR GNB, and (3) identify sepsis phenotypes at high risk for MDR GNB in a well-balanced cohort and assess the impact of case mix on risk prediction model performance. We will mathematically derive resistance thresholds that link population resistance rates to individual patient risk of death in sepsis caused by MDR GNB, assess factors that impact prediction performance, and incorporate rich clinical data from 15 hospitals in our healthcare system to identify stable common sepsis phenotypes. Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has training in Infectious Diseases and Critical Care Medicine and experience in antimicrobial resistance in critically ill patients. This proposal will build on her clinical work and previous research experience in finding innovative methods to solve challenging problems at the intersection of infectious diseases and critical care medicine. Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has six career objectives: (1) pursue advanced training in clinical epidemiology; (2) acquire skills in advanced linear regression and multilevel modeling; (3) learn supervised machine learning methods; (4) acquire skills in big data management in healthcare and methods to handle missing data; (5) improve scientific communication, grantsmanship, and leadership, and (6) participate in training in the responsible conduct of research. She will achieve these goals through didactic coursework, hands-on research experience, and active mentoring from experts in Infectious Diseases, Critical Care Medicine, and applied clinical informatics. She will continue to develop innovative methods to mitigate the antimicrobial resistance crisis, especially in critically ill patients, and become an analytics translator at the intersection of clinical medicine and clinical applied informatics. The fertile research environment at Washington University in St. Louis, the experienced mentorship team, and a well-crafted career development plan will enable Dr. Vazquez Guillamet to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independently funded clinician-investigator utilizing big data to develop applications for risk prediction, surveillance, and outcome comparisons in antimicrobial resistance and sepsis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The significant burden of sepsis augmented by the escalating rates of antimicrobial resistance has incited many national performance improvement initiatives. Research efforts have focused on predicting patients at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant pathogens but existing models have led to risk overestimation thus promoting indiscriminate antimicrobial use and further fueling the emergence of resistance. The candidate, Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has focused on innovative ways to assess the impact of antimicrobial resistance and to develop generalizable useful risk prediction models. The current proposed research expands her previous work with the overall goal to develop clinical decision support tools that will improve antibiotic prescribing practices and will allow valid, case-mix adjusted comparisons across hospitals in terms of resistance prevalence rates and antimicrobial use.",Sepsis phenotypes at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli: elucidating the impact of sepsis definition and patient case mix on prediction performance,10106044,K08GM140310,"['American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Bacillus', 'Big Data', 'Case Mixes', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Empiricism', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Excess Mortality', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Standardization', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'attributable mortality', 'base', 'big data management', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'combat', 'experience', 'hands on research', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'personalized risk prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'risk prediction model', 'septic patients', 'skills', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,167942,0.011431900008514496
"Automated point-of-care identification of innocent Still's murmur in children PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of the proposed research and technology transfer effort is to develop a low-cost, point-of-care, mobile device-based technology for automated identification of Still's murmur, the most common innocent (benign and harmless) heart murmur of childhood. This novel technology could reduce the current rate of over half a million children unnecessarily referred to pediatric cardiologists by primary care providers each year in the United States. In Phase I, AusculTech Dx and Children's National Medical Center developed a machine-learning algorithm capable of identifying Still's murmur with high accuracy (90% sensitivity, 99% specificity). To enable digital recording, essential for computerized murmur analysis, we also developed a digital stethoscope that connects to a smartphone and is equivalent in performance to a commercial stethoscope. Our envisioned product, called StethAid, is a combination of this novel digital stethoscope and a smartphone application (app). Having successfully met the Phase I performance milestones, we now propose to fully develop StethAid and conduct a multicenter trial through the following three specific aims: (1) develop and test a clinical-grade digital stethoscope, (2) develop fully feature software app, (3) conduct a multicenter trial of automated Still's murmur identification. For the multicenter trial, we have expanded our collaboration to include Boston Children's Hospital and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Our deliverable for Phase II is a technology platform validated by leading pediatric cardiologists that is ready for seeking regulatory approvals, deployment at PCP offices, and commercialization. As a decision support system, StethAid could empower PCPs to identify Still's murmur accurately and thus reduce the huge number of unnecessary specialist referrals. This should save the healthcare system hundreds of millions of dollars annually, allow pediatric cardiologists to focus on patients with serious conditions, and protect healthy children and their families from the unnecessary anxiety, inconvenience, and expense of seeing a pediatric cardiologist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over half a million children are referred unnecessarily to pediatric cardiologists by general physicians for the evaluation of Still's murmur, a normal and harmless heart murmur. This project will develop and clinically validate a novel mobile technology for automated recognition of this murmur in order to reduce the current rate of such unnecessary referrals and associated costs and inconvenience.",Automated point-of-care identification of innocent Still's murmur in children,9903425,R42HL131081,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Apple', 'Benign', 'Bluetooth', 'Boston', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hearing', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart murmur', 'Incidence', 'Legal patent', 'Libraries', 'Medical center', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical center', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pediatric cardiologist', 'performance tests', 'point of care', 'prototype', 'smartphone Application', 'sound', 'tool', 'wasting', 'web interface']",NHLBI,"AUSCULTECH DX, LLC",R42,2020,708937,0.04604517844596768
"Multifactorial spatiotemporal analyses to evaluate environmental triggers and patient-level clinical characteristics of severe asthma exacerbations in children Asthma is a chronic heterogeneous airway disorder characterized by inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, airway hyperreactivity, and impaired airflow. Severe exacerbations of asthma occur frequently in children and require immediate use of systemic steroid therapy to prevent serious outcomes such as hospitalization or death. In addition to direct health risks, pediatric asthma exerts a substantial cost burden, as asthma exacerbations are a leading cause of emergency department visits, hospitalization, and missed school days. Multiple environmental factors are purported to play a role in asthma symptoms, including aeroallergens, pollutants, weather changes, and community viral outbreaks such as influenza. Additionally, asthma prevalence is greater in children of low socioeconomic status (SES) and in African-American and Hispanic/Latino children, suggesting both environmental and genetic effects on asthma incidence and severity. The existence of geographical asthma “hotspots” indicates that asthma prevalence and severity are influenced by place-based risks, including local air quality, built environment factors, access to health care providers, socioeconomic factors, culture, and behavior. To effectively prevent and treat pediatric asthma attacks, it is necessary to understand how patient-specific characteristics interact with environmental factors to render an individual susceptible to severe asthma exacerbations. Lacking sufficient power, previous studies have largely examined suspected asthma triggers in isolation; thus, there is a significant knowledge gap regarding how environmental factors interact with each other and with patient-level factors to promote severe asthma exacerbations in pediatric populations. We hypothesize that a longitudinal analysis of environmental exposures and patient-level factors will elucidate new multifactorial causes of severe asthma exacerbations. To elucidate the contributions and interactions of environmental and patient-level factors, we will apply machine learning approaches to a longitudinal (2007-2017) geocoded database of patient electronic health records detailing asthma-related health encounters and publicly available, overlapping spatiotemporal environmental data. Further, we will evaluate the interactions between person-level clinical factors, including obesity, history of premature birth/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and atopy, to determine their effects on susceptibility to selected environmental triggers. These analyses will 1) provide an analysis of the relative contribution and interactions of environmental factors to pediatric asthma exacerbations, 2) identify geographic hotspots of asthma prevalence and severity, and 3) determine how person-level clinical factors influence susceptibility to different asthma triggers. Our findings will provide new insights into risk factors for severe asthma exacerbations, spur new studies into the biological mechanisms that underlie the interactions between human biology and the environment, inform preventive strategies and patient education efforts, and serve as a model that can be expanded to larger cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma affects 1 in 10 children in the United States, and severe asthma exacerbations require immediate medical attention to prevent hospitalization or death. A wide variety of environmental triggers such as pollutants and allergens are associated with asthma symptoms, but the interaction between different environmental triggers and person-level characteristics such as obesity, allergy, and history of premature birth are unclear. These studies will use longitudinal, overlapping asthma patient and environmental data to understand the role of different environmental triggers in asthma exacerbations in order to develop new preventive and therapeutic strategies for asthma.",Multifactorial spatiotemporal analyses to evaluate environmental triggers and patient-level clinical characteristics of severe asthma exacerbations in children,9884782,R21HL145415,"['Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Air', 'Air Movements', 'Allergens', 'Asthma', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Fibrinogen', 'Food', 'Genetic', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Hispanics', 'Hormonal', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human Biology', 'Humidity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Influenza', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Latino', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Needs Assessment', 'Neighborhoods', 'North Carolina', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Pollen', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Steroid therapy', 'Symptoms', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Visit', 'Weather', 'airborne allergen', 'airway hyperresponsiveness', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'atopy', 'base', 'built environment', 'cohort', 'cost', 'demographics', 'deprivation', 'electronic data', 'health care availability', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'low socioeconomic status', 'machine learning method', 'medical attention', 'mucus hypersecretion', 'novel', 'pediatric emergency', 'pollutant', 'prevent', 'respiratory virus', 'response', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'urgent care', 'violent crime']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,120750,0.11160516510593747
"Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood PROJECT SUMMARY This K08 proposal describes a comprehensive training program tailored to the career development of the candidate. The candidate is a physician who recently completed a clinical fellowship in Allergy and Immunology and whose research contributions to date have addressed early-life risk factors for childhood asthma and allergy with a focus on the diet and intestinal microenvironment. Asthma and environmental allergies have increased in prevalence and asthma is now the most common chronic disease in children. The increased occurrence of asthma and allergy has been attributed to changes including dietary shifts and dysbiosis, though contributory factors are incompletely defined and interventions to prevent asthma and allergy remain elusive. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (FA) have well-defined immunologic effects, and the ratio of omega-6:omega-3 FA intake has increased concurrently with the increase in allergic disease. However, reported associations of PUFA with asthma and allergy in childhood are inconsistent. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that effects of PUFA are impacted by host genotype and the intestinal microbiota. Our scientific goal is to examine these omics to identify determinants of when a safe and inexpensive intervention, intake of PUFA, is effective in reducing asthma and allergy in childhood. We will utilize data from 6- and 7-year-old participants in three study populations: Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), Project Viva and Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC). We have three specific aims: (1) Identify gene by omega-3 FA interactions in asthma and allergy in childhood; (2): Define the contributions of intestinal bacteria and metabolites to associations of omega-3 FA dietary intake with asthma and allergy in childhood; and (3) Characterize clinically relevant childhood plasma PUFA profiles using unsupervised classification methods and integrative machine learning algorithms. Our findings could lead to cost-effective and personalized approaches to asthma and allergy reduction by elucidating which individuals benefit from dietary PUFA supplementation and whether microbiota-modifying therapies could boost protective responses to PUFA. The candidate proposes to execute this research plan alongside a training and development plan including hands-on bioinformatics instruction and preparation for independent mechanistic and clinical R01-level follow-up projects. The proposed work will be mentored by Dr. Scott Weiss, a Professor at Harvard Medical School and a leader in environmental, nutritional and genetic asthma risk factors. The candidate will obtain additional scientific input and career guidance from a team including a co-mentor and three scientific advisors with expertise in asthma epidemiology, lipid mediators of allergic inflammation, multi-omics analysis and translational research methods. This proposal represents a natural continuation of the candidate’s prior experience and will provided the support needed for her to become an independent investigator with a focus on precision medicine approaches to asthma and allergy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are dietary fats with effects on immune function and inflammation, and the genes that a person is born with or the bacteria that live in one’s gut could influence how the body processes and responds to PUFA. We will study children to see if having particular gene variants or specific gut bacteria or chemicals impacts how PUFA intake relates to risk of asthma and allergy. Understanding how genetic, microbial, and other factors influence PUFA processing and asthma and allergies could lead to new cost- effective ways to prevent and treat these increasingly common and clinically burdensome diseases.",Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood,10009430,K08HL148178,"['3 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergic inflammation', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Asthma', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Availability', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary Fatty Acid', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Fellowship', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Instruction', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Multiomic Data', 'Omega-3 Fatty Acids', 'Omega-6 Fatty Acids', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D supplementation', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Wheezing', 'Work', 'antenatal', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'defined contribution', 'dysbiosis', 'environmental allergy', 'experience', 'fatty acid supplementation', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'immune function', 'learning strategy', 'lipid mediator', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'metabolome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multiple omics', 'nutrition related genetics', 'personalized approach', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'professor', 'response', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'study population', 'western diet']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2020,170640,0.09893111179924126
"Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use across different clinical centers; (2) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post- surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a multi-center study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 focus on relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology, developed at Texas Children's Hospital, which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor,9996775,R01HL142994,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Ventricle', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical center', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'news', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,574855,0.054204317510767465
"The role of the oral microbiome in disparities in dental caries and responsiveness to caries prevention Project Summary This project proposes to leverage innovative data collected as part of a large, ongoing, cluster randomized trial of therapies to arrest and prevent dental caries in low-income, minority children to (1) investigate the potential microbial determinants of oral health inequities across racial/ethnic children and (2) explore the degree of susceptibility and responsiveness to conventional therapeutic interventions for caries. Over the past ten years, we have conducted multiple studies on the effectiveness and feasibility of preventive treatments for dental caries applied in pragmatic settings across the United States. In each study, an average of 30% of children was observed to have untreated decay at baseline, a prevalence which was consistently higher amongst minority children. Following receipt of therapeutic interventions for caries prevention and observed longitudinally, some children stayed caries free (responders) while others experienced new incidence of tooth decay (non-responders). This phenomenon of resistance and susceptibility to caries occurred in children with or without prior caries experience, was found amongst children living in both fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities, and was not related to sex or age. In total, re-occurrence of dental caries following preventive therapies was observed in approximately 15% of children regardless of prior caries. Our intention is to study these phenomena. We propose to collect new data from the oral microbiome in a cohort of children receiving biannual silver diamine fluoride (SDF) for dental caries, as well as data on key confounders including dietary intake and oral hygiene behavior. This new data will be linked to data collected from clinical examinations and participant demographics. Children identified for this study will be participants in the referenced clinical trial. Uncovering the role of the microbiome in health disparities could enhance our understanding of why some populations have poorer success rates, greater severity of disease, or overall elevated disease risks compared to others. Our primary goals are to (1) utilize microbiome sequence analysis and taxonomic assignment to identify the potential microbiota and metabolites of caries that exist within different racial/ethnic groups with and without untreated caries, (2) compare the distribution of these microbiota prior to and following receipt of silver diamine fluoride to arrest and prevent caries, and (3) develop a predictive model of responsiveness to SDF using artificial neural networks and LASSO/elastic nets. This will be the first study to longitudinally examine the microbial determinants of innate caries susceptibility and resistance to traditional preventive therapies. Results may improve the precision, targeting, and impact of caries prevention programs. Project Narrative This project focuses on (1) the microbiota determinants of oral health inequities in US children and (2) the degree of susceptibility and responsiveness to conventional therapeutic interventions to arrest and prevent dental caries. Using data from an ongoing, large scale, cluster randomized trial of preventive therapies for caries, we will collect additional data from the oral microbiome to explore disparities in untreated caries across racial/ethnic groups, compare the distribution of relevant microbiota and their metabolites in children with and without caries before and after receipt of silver diamine fluoride, and generate a predictive model to predict whether children are more or less susceptible to the effects of traditional preventive therapies. Together this research will improve the precision, targeting, and anticipated impact of caries prevention programs.",The role of the oral microbiome in disparities in dental caries and responsiveness to caries prevention,10241702,R56DE028933,"['Aftercare', 'Age', 'Asians', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biota', 'Caries prevention', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Dental Hygiene', 'Dental caries', 'Development', 'Diamines', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Fluorides', 'Gender', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Hispanics', 'Hygiene', 'Incidence', 'Indigenous', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Minority', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Phylogeny', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention program', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Severity of illness', 'Silver', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapy trial', 'United States', 'Water fluoridation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical examination', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'health equity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota metabolites', 'minority children', 'neural network', 'oral microbial community', 'oral microbiome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'responders and non-responders', 'sex', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'traditional therapy']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R56,2020,517296,0.03216815910692432
"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design. The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis. ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",9864083,R01HD087363,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergent care', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'data registry', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electronic registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient health information', 'patient registry', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'risk prediction model', 'septic patients', 'support tools', 'wasting']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,611937,0.02067065845989951
"Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH The obesity field is fraught with problems of measuring people's diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors that are hindering the advancement of the field to find promising solutions for obesity prevention and treatment. An important example is screen media use, a prominent cause for sedentary time that has been linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome, as well as other unwanted physiologic, psychosocial, and academic outcomes in children. Given the important impact screen use has on children's health, our ability to measure the time children spend on screens is very limited. Current assessments typically rely either on (1) general questions estimating “typical use;” or self- or parent-report via screen use diaries, both which have reporting bias and recall bias; or (2) devises initially intended to restrict children's TV viewing (TV Allowance™), which may have intervention effects or miss-classify TV viewing time. While automatic and objective measures of physical activity have shown validity and reliability for quantifying children's physical activity, no system that is automatic, accurate and unobtrusive has been developed to assess children's screen use on different platforms. Advances in technology, such as person detection, accurate facial recognition based on images, and imaging, computer vision and signal processing algorithms now offer novel and promising solutions to objectively and automatically measure people's screen viewing behaviors. We will leverage these recent advances and integrate them to develop a first of its kind, in-home, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system: Family Level Assessment of Screen use in the Home (FLASH) that uses an embedded computing platform connected to a video camera on larger, stationary screens (FLASH-TV); or functions as a background app using a front facing camera (FLASH-Mobile). Our trans-disciplinary group, consisting of behavioral researchers at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and electrical engineers at Rice University, propose to develop and asses the validity of the FLASH to accurately identify whether and for how long a child is using screen media devices. In this multiple-PI application, the development of FLASH is led by engineers at Rice. Once a final system has been developed, alpha and beta tested, a validation study will take place in observation labs by the BCM behavioral researchers with 6-10 year old children for FLASH-TV and FLASH-Mobile (n=43). Comparisons of FLASH output will be made to staff observations of children participating in a set of structured predefined activities. Next FLASH will be assessed for feasibility and accuracy for identifying children's screen use across platforms in a naturalistic home setting (n=46), compared to direct observation and screen use diaries. This project has the potential of creating a paradigm shift in scientist's ability to assess the role screen use has on health outcomes or intervention effects of screen media reduction programs, similar to that of accelerometers for physical activity research. FLASH has the potential of having a significant impact on public health and clinical research regarding screen media use.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Higher levels of screen media use have been associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and other unwanted health and psychosocial outcomes in children. Despite the recent attention screen use has received among public health and clinical circles, the measurement of screen use behaviors is very crude and inaccurate. In this application, we propose to develop and assess the validity of an in-home objective, unobtrusive, automatic, privacy preserving screen use monitoring system, called FLASH that has the potential to revolutionize the measurement of screen use behaviors.",Development and Validation of an Automated Measurement of Child Screen Media Use: FLASH,9906897,R01DK113269,"['10 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'Asses', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral outcome', 'college', 'computational platform', 'cost', 'diaries', 'field study', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity development', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'privacy preservation', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'tv watching', 'validation studies']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,505658,-0.018679757357099928
"Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia Reading instruction prompts the emergence of neural circuits that are specialized for rapidly translating printed symbols into sound and meaning. Understanding how these circuits differ in children with dyslexia, and change with learning, is an important scientific challenge that holds practical implications for education. The proposed research employs longitudinal measurements in children with dyslexia over the course of a highly effective intervention program to: (a) determine how brain structure and function change in response to reading instruction; and (b) investigate neurobiological factors that predispose a child to struggle or succeed in the intervention. Thus, this proposal seeks to determine both how education shapes brain development, and how a child’s unique neurobiology predicts educational outcomes. Aim 1) White matter plasticity and learning – White matter was previously considered static infrastructure; it is now known that many cellular properties of the white matter change with learning. Reading interventions provide a powerful tool to study experience-dependent plasticity in the human brain. Based on novel quantitative MRI and diffusion MRI measurements developed by the PI and collaborators, it is now possible to quantify changes in cell density, intra-axonal water and myelination at millimeter resolution. Longitudinal measurements collected before, during, and after the intervention will be used to model the time-course of white matter plasticity associated with improvements in reading skills, and investigate the biological mechanisms that underlie differences in learning among children. Aim 2) Bottom-up and top-down computations in the reading circuit - When our eyes fixate upon a word, a cascade of neural processes is initiated, beginning in the visual system and progressing through a series of computations that translate the visual representation into sound and meaning. We have developed the first model of the neural computations performed by critical components of the brain’s reading circuitry. Based on this new understanding of computations in the literate adult brain, we will investigate how computations differ in children with dyslexia, and change in response to reading instruction. Aim 3) Neural biomarkers of learning outcomes - Even in a controlled and intensive learning environment, some children show substantial improvements in reading skill, while others show limited change. What biological factors predispose a child to excel or struggle when provided a high-quality intervention? Pre- intervention MRI measurements will be examined as predictor variables for individual differences in intervention learning rate, and long-term, post-intervention outcomes. Aim 3 will capitalize machine learning to develop a model of the neuroanatomical factors that predict learning outcomes. Dyslexia, an impairment in accurate or fluent word recognition, is the most common learning disability affecting roughly ten percent of children. This proposal capitalizes on cutting edge neuroimaging methods, in combination with carefully controlled educational interventions and behavioral measurements, to generate a new understanding of how successful intervention shapes the development of the brain circuits that support skilled reading. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms of successful remediation of dyslexia, and individual differences in learning, will pave the way for personalized approaches to dyslexia treatment.",Neural mechanisms of successful intervention in children with dyslexia,10013256,R01HD095861,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cell Density', 'Child', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Eye', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Myelin Sheath', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Water', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain remodeling', 'brain shape', 'cognitive task', 'density', 'educational atmosphere', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'intervention program', 'learning outcome', 'literate', 'millimeter', 'mouse model', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'phonology', 'post intervention', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'successful intervention', 'tool', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,531494,-0.008667811309133175
"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration. Project Narrative Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases remains a leading cause of death in both children and adults worldwide, yet no clinical tools have ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. The proposed research will both develop and validate an innovative new mobile phone based platform for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents, and older children with acute diarrhea. This new mobile health tool will help physicians, nurses, and other providers worldwide to determine the best management strategies for patients with acute diarrhea, potentially improving and rationalizing care for the hundreds of millions of patients each year presenting to healthcare facilities around the world with acute diarrhea.",Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease,9969419,R01DK116163,"['5 year old', 'Acute Diarrhea', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bangladesh', 'Beds', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'IV Fluid', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'International Unit', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Provider', 'Rehydration Solutions', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical examination', 'clinical predictors', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diarrheal disease', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'international center', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2020,618136,0.016142454255505447
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the “Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis” study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9910440,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical predictors', 'comorbidity', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'stroke risk', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,535600,0.021643949912048356
"Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities Project Summary Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology as a result of prolonged neglect, abuse, and care disruptions that impact neurodevelopment. It is currently estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research, including findings from the original grant of this renewal, has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining sophisitcated data-analysis methods that use experiential and phenotypic heterogeneity together with longitudinal neuroimaging and behavioral assessments in school-age children. This approach will increase precision when linking ECAs and child outcomes associated with the Research Domain Criteria constructs of Negative Valence and Cognitive Control Systems (NVS/CCS). The overarching goal of the present work is to create an explanatory model for the heterogeneous impact of ECAs on neurodevelopmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. This project's premise is that children exposed to ECAs have highly heterogeneous developmental histories as well as heterogeneous outcomes; therefore, prediction of ECA outcomes requires cutting-edge, sophisticated data analytic methods. We hypothesize that data-driven approaches will 1) more precisely define NVS/CCS outcomes for school-aged children with ECAs, and 2) provide a more robust explanatory model for links between ECAs and NVS/CCS trajectories. Aim 1A subtypes children with a history of ECAs based on 2.5-year developmental trajectories of NVS/CCS. 300 6-8 year old children (250 sampled from previous institutional and foster care; 50 community comparisons) will provide neuroimaging, behavioral, and self/caregiver reports every 15 months for 2.5 years. Biclustering methods will be applied to the baseline and follow-up data to identify homogeneous NVS/CCS final outcome clusters of children. Aim 1B develops an explanatory model to predict developmental trajectory subtypes for children with ECAs, from early life profiles and brain/behavior phenotypes at the time of enrollment. Machine learning methods applied to early life profiles, baseline NVS/CCS profiles, and sex, will predict developmental trajectory subtypes. Aim 2 identifies adverse and protective life events during the 2.5-year assessment period that are predictive of 2.5-year follow-up outcomes for children with ECAs. The inclusion of child-sex and current life- events will identify potential divergence in pathways across middle childhood. This prospective design of children exposed to various ECAs is designed to develop predictive models for ECA trajectory subtypes and outcomes, which can inform our understanding of risk and protective factors in accord with the goals of precision medicine.   Project Narrative Children with severe Early Caregiving Adversities (ECAs) are the most vulnerable to psychopathology, and it is estimated that addressing ECAs would lead to a 29.8% reduction in worldwide psychiatric illness. Existing research has demonstrated that there is a very strong link between ECA exposures and increased risk for psychopathology and altered neurodevelopment at the population level; and yet, given the heterogeneity in ECA populations, there is a critical gap in knowledge regarding how ECAs increase any specific risks to an individual child. The proposed research addresses this significant mental health problem by combining longitudinal multimodal brain imaging and high- dimensional behavioral assessments in school-age children together with sophisticated data analytic techniques to increase precision when linking heterogeneous ECAs and child outcome with the goal of predicting mental health outcomes and identifying children who would benefit most from specific early interventions.  ",Predicting Heterogeneous Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in School-age Children with Early Caregiving Adversities,9964904,R01MH091864,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Orphanages', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'caregiving', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'foster care', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'middle childhood', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prepuberty', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'violence exposure']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2020,698273,0.035373138290661195
"Integrative metabolomic characterization of ADHD and asthma comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Su H. Chu, PhD, MS is a biostatistician and molecular epidemiologist with strong and substantial commitments to integrative omic research in respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. Her career objective is to become an independent investigator with expertise in developing and applying novel statistical methods and multiomic network approaches that facilitate mechanistic understanding of the intersection of respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. This proposal combines Dr. Chu’s extensive training in integrative omic methods development, along with her experience in genetic and metabolomic research, to examine the integrative metabolomic etiology of asthma and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder overlap (AAO). A wealth of epidemiological literature has revealed with remarkable consistency that asthmatic patients are at greater risk for ADHD, and vice versa, with a number of longitudinal studies of childhood asthma indicating excess risk of ADHD in adolescence and adulthood. However, no studies have directly interrogated the biological mechanisms by which these conditions may be related. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that childhood asthma and ADHD share both common and distinct dysregulated metabolic processes, some of which may have drivers that are genetic in origin. This will be explored using existing genetic and metabolomic data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), and the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC), three large prospective cohorts of children with extensive longitudinal phenotyping and multiple omic data types, by identifying metabolites and metabolic profiles associated with AAO (aim 1), constructing multiomic models and features that characterize dysregulated metabolic processes and their upstream drivers in AAO (aim 2), and validation and replication of all findings (aim 3). As Dr. Chu completes these aims, her career development program will facilitate the achievement of her primary training goals: 1) increase clinical understanding of ADHD and asthma diagnosis and treatment; 2) gain a nuanced understanding of best methods for, and practical experience in, the biological and statistical integration of genetic and metabolomic data; 3) develop skills in machine learning and integrative network methods for multiomic analysis; 4) strengthen current areas of experience to stay on the cutting edge of new analytic and study design techniques; and 5) enhance skills in mentorship, teaching, and the responsible conduct and communication of research. The support of a diverse mentoring team comprised of world experts in the fields of asthma and psychiatric genetics, metabolomics, integrative omics, and statistics, along with her strong quantitative training and the vibrant intellectual community of Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, ensure the success of this proposal. Finally, this research will use state-of-the-art multiomic techniques to lay the initial groundwork for understanding the pathobiology of asthma and ADHD comorbidity, a major and well-established public health concern, from which new research programs will emerge. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although a rich epidemiological literature has demonstrated a high comorbidity between asthma, the most common respiratory disease worldwide, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most common behavioral disorder among children, with reports of significant increases in diagnoses in recent years, no studies have interrogated the potential molecular pathobiology underlying the mutual excess risk between asthma and ADHD. This proposal aims to use integrative techniques by combining genetic and metabolomic data to characterize common and distinct mechanisms and pathways of dysregulated metabolism in the presence of comorbid asthma and ADHD and to develop multiomic profiles which can assist in predicting higher risk of ADHD among asthmatic children. The findings from this study will be instrumental in understanding the molecular underpinnings of two highly prevalent public health concerns, and this study will be the first of its kind to interrogate the molecular intersections between asthma and ADHD.",Integrative metabolomic characterization of ADHD and asthma comorbidity,10041169,K01HL153941,"['Achievement', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Communication Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Formulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration Disorders', 'Risk', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Sphingolipids', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tryptophan', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Woman', 'antenatal', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'biological systems', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'method development', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychogenetics', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2020,178200,0.06488674878318097
"Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility. Project abstract Asthma and obesity are two of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and are increasing in prevalence in the US and worldwide. Obesity and asthma are linked: as body mass index increases, the risk of asthma also increases. Asthma is not a single disease, but a group of overlapping phenotypes caused by multiple distinct molecular mechanisms, many of which remain undefined. Obese asthmatics have a severe phenotype of asthma that is poorly responsive to standard medication regimens and often characterized by more severe exacerbations, most of which are due to viral infections. However, the underlying immunometabolic mechanism leading to immune dysfunction in obese asthma remains unclear. To address this and establish testable hypotheses, I conducted a pilot study of pediatric asthmatics (A), obese asthmatics (OA), obese (O) and healthy control (HC) patients using multiple high dimensional assays, including mass cytometry, metabolomics and serum cytokine measurements. This study showed that obese asthmatics have two forms of immune dysregulation that may impair anti-viral responses: increased type 2 immunity and CD8 T cell exhaustion. In addition, OA patients have alterations in serum metabolites, including increased levels of glutamate, which may underlie some of these alterations in T cell state. Here, I intend to tackle the fundamental and tractable question of the nature of immune dysregulation in obese asthma by testing hypotheses derived from my human data using relevant mouse models of disease. First, I will test whether elevated levels of serum glutamate, a serum metabolite increased in OA patients, directly increases type 2 immunity (Aim 1). Second, I will confirm the presence of increased CD8 T cell exhaustion in a mouse model of OA and assess the impact of T cell exhaustion on influenza infection by measuring the impact of abrogating a core exhaustion pathway, the PD-1 pathway (Aim 2). Both aims will utilize novel techniques, including mass cytometry and immunometabolic studies. I will receive training in bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to systems immunology, including machine learning, that will allow me to gain insight into these comprehensive, multifaceted datasets to establish the core pathways and targets that should be pursued as therapeutic targets in these complex patients. My proposal outlines a 5-year training program for my development as a physician-scientist in Pediatric Allergy Immunology. In particular, I will focus on gaining additional expertise in cutting-edge mass cytometry and systems immunology data analysis techniques, as well as mouse models of asthma and obesity. This will allow me to integrate complex human and mouse datasets, generating and testing mechanistic hypotheses with direct clinical applicability. I believe my training plan, within the remarkable environments in Dr. Wherry’s lab, CHOP and UPenn, will position me to become an independently funded physician scientist. Project Narrative Pediatric obese asthma is a severe disease that responds poorly to standard asthma medications and has higher rates of more severe viral asthma flares. Here, I have used a combination of advanced experimental methods and cutting-edge data analysis tools to uncover possible causes of immune system dysfunction in obese asthma that may play important roles in their poor anti-viral responses. Based on my data from patients, I will use mouse models of obese asthma to test whether changes in serum metabolites or immune exhaustion are important causes of the immune dysfunction observed in pediatric obese asthma.",Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility.,9838149,K08AI135091,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Allergens', 'Anti-Asthmatic Agents', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Antiviral Response', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Caring', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Flare', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Interleukin-13', 'Knockout Mice', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Obese Mice', 'Obesity', 'PD-1 pathway', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Activation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'T cell differentiation', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Th2 Cells', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Weights and Measures', 'Work', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'antiviral immunity', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthma model', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'atopy', 'base', 'career', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cytokine', 'dimensional analysis', 'drinking water', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pediatric patients', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'respiratory infection virus', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'translational approach']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K08,2020,186948,0.0733879572350772

"Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record Project Summary/Abstract Sepsis is a critical illness syndrome characterized by infection leading to life-threatening organ failure. Affecting over 200,000 individuals in the United States each year, sepsis accounts for nearly half of all hospital deaths and over $20 billion in yearly US hospital costs. Despite the development and dissemination of evidence-based guidelines, most patients with sepsis do not consistently receive recommended care, resulting in preventable morbidity and mortality. Consequently, there is increasing interest in implementing health policies designed to incentivize quality improvement at the hospital level. The largest and most prominent of these policies to date is the new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) quality reporting initiative, known as SEP-1. SEP-1 requires hospitals to report their compliance with a variety of evidence-based care processes, including timely antibiotic administration, timely volume resuscitation, and routine monitoring of the clinical response to therapy. SEP-1 is unique among quality measures in the CMS Inpatient Quality Reporting Program, both because it is the only measure based on a critical illness syndrome and because it is of unparalleled complexity, requiring the coordinated efforts of multiple health care providers across the acute care spectrum. As a consequence, it is essential to understand how SEP-1 has affected patient care and clinical outcomes. To address this need, we propose to comprehensively evaluate the impact of the SEP-1 measure using the electronic health record (EHR) of a large multihospital health system. An EHR-based approach will allow us to understand the impact of the policy in exceptional detail, yielding actionable data not only for policy makers seeking to refine SEP-1 but also for health systems seeking to respond to SEP-1 in a way that maximizes the potential benefits. First, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis recognition and documentation using natural language processing of clinical notes. Second, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis care processes using structured data elements such as vital signs, laboratory values, and medication administration. Third, we will evaluate the impact of the program on patient mortality, length of stay, and requirement for organ support. In all aims we will examine both overall effects and hospital-specific effects, providing an understanding of how hospitals and health systems implement quality improvement in the context of a novel reporting mandate. Together, these aims will yield important new insights into how clinicians and hospitals implement new quality reporting programs. At the same time, through a program of structured mentorship, career development, and stakeholder involvement, this project will provide the principal investigator with new skills in the use of the EHR to evaluate health care quality and the impact of system-level health policies, uniquely positioning him to lead future efforts to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate EHR-based performance interventions for critically ill patients. NARRATIVE Sepsis is a life-threatening response to infection and accounts for significant morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs in the United States. In this proposal, we will use data from the electronic health record of a large health system to evaluate the effects of a novel sepsis quality reporting program on sepsis recognition, treatment, and outcomes. Our findings will yield important early information on the quality reporting program’s impact, helping to guide policy makers as they seek to refine the program and yielding novel insights into strategies to improve sepsis quality in US hospitals.",Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record,9936306,K08HS025455,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K08,2020,146065,0.002888315622045058
"Novel Wearable and Wireless Scratch Sensor as a Drug Discovery Tool Itch leads to serious impairment of quality of life—often times on par with pain. Itch is the hallmark symptom and primary driver of morbidity for atopic dermatitis (AD)—one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases affecting 24 million adults and 10 million children in the U.S. Currently, there is a severe lack of objective measurement of itch. Psychometric surveys are point measurements that lack sensitivity and validity—particularly in children. Measuring itch-related scratching behavior offers a potential objective way to measure itch. Unfortunately, wrist strapped electronics fail to capture scratch accurately and are not adapted for children. This project seeks to accelerate the full qualification of a novel, wearable sensor leveraging a machine learning algorithm to objectively and accurately measure scratching. We propose to address key comments from the FDA in our accepted letter of intent (DDT COA #000120) by accomplishing the following specific aims. Aim 1: we will augment our current scratch sensor to achieve 7-day battery life on a single wireless charge (current battery life: 24 hours) to increase adherence and reduce user burden. Aim 2: we propose to extend healthy normal testing to strengthen our predictive algorithm and train against additional cofounders with an additional 8 subjects (n=16 total). In addition, we will improve the usability and cybersecurity of our software and cloud system. Aim 3: we will extend our existing clinical study at Northwestern University to include more pediatric and adult individuals with AD (n=30 target total). Psychometric surveys will assess user/caregiver experience afterwards, and determine which features of the sensor have greatest value to patients. Success will be defined by successful submission of a full qualification plan to the FDA within 12 months as a fully accepted drug discovery tool. The long- term goal is to make this scratch sensor widely available to support drug development by providing an objective endpoint for itch, and inform future clinical care of treatment response in a patient’s naturalistic environment. Further applications include deployment in other itchy conditions (e.g. prurigo nodularis, chronic pruritus of the elderly, pruritus associated with renal or hepatic failure). Itch is a profoundly disturbing symptom that greatly reduces quality of life. For Atopic dermatitis (eczema) sufferers, a disease that afflicts 10% of children and 4% of adults in the U.S., itch is the greatest source of morbidity. However, there remains a lack of objective, repeatable measurement tools for itch hindering drug development. Measuring scratch behavior offers one opportunity to quantify itch. This project will support efforts to fully qualify an accepted letter of intent for a novel wearable scratch sensor as a drug development tool (COA# 0001120).",Novel Wearable and Wireless Scratch Sensor as a Drug Discovery Tool,10146184,U01FD007001,[' '],FDA,"SONICA, LLC",U01,2020,249103,-0.012339575771121335
"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance  Pediatric septic shock, a leading cause of childhood death, is often recognized late, causing preventable morbidity, and improved early diagnostic approaches would improve the timeliness of sepsis diagnosis, accelerate treatment and improve outcomes. This proposal will provide mentored research training to use predictive modeling to improve early diagnosis of pediatric sepsis, and test the delivery of clinical decision support to clinicians through the electronic health record in an implementation trial. This proposal responds to the AHRQ priorities of improving health care quality through use of information systems, improving safety and quality of care by synthesizing and communicating evidence to health care professionals, advances knowledge generation in a learning health system and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs.",Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED),9985019,K08HS025696,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K08,2020,148539,0.03596269304957286
"Using Real-world Data to Assess the Burden of Diabetes in Children and Adolescents in Florida ABSTRACT Strong evidence suggests an increasing trend of diabetes onset for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1DM & T2DM) among children and adolescent in the United State (US) and globally since 2000. Significant racial- ethnic and geographic disparities have also been documented in diabetes incidence and in access to care and metabolic control in this vulnerable population. These alarming observations call for a timely surveillance system for the onset of diabetes among children and adolescents, so that tailored public health programs can be developed and health care resources can be efficiently allocated to address the needs of these vulnerable groups in a timely manner. However, diabetes surveillance studies on this particular population are limited in the US. The primary source for current prevalence and incidence estimates of diabetes among children and adolescents in the US for the CDC is from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth (SEARCH) study, which relies on an active case reporting system from enrolled clinical centers over ten states. The SEARCH study is important, however, does not include the majority of the population located at the south-east region, where diabetes prevalence was found to be the highest in the country among the adult population (i.e., the “diabetes belt”). Less is known if the prevalence and incidence of diabetes among children and adolescents in this area, including Florida, are also the highest in the country. In this proposed study, we will build a surveillance system in Florida to monitor the prevalence and incidence of diabetes among children and adolescents in an accurate, cost-effective, and timely fashion. As the 3rd-most populous state in the United States with a high level of racial-ethnical and geographic diversities, Florida will serve as an essential piece for the national diabetes surveillance system and provide important data to study the diabetes epidemiology among children and adolescents in the south-east region of the US where diabetes was found the most prevalent in the country. We will leverage our unique real-world data (RWD) source, the OneFlorida network, a large state-wide repository of RWD that contains linked EHRs, claims, vital statistics, and birth records data, covering more than 60% of Floridians across all 67 Florida counties to build this diabetes surveillance system. In particular, we will combine the structured and unstructured data (e.g., physician’s notes) from patients EHRs to develop novel data-driven computable phenotyping (CP) algorithms through modern machine learning methods, so that our estimations on the prevalence and incidence of T1DM and T2DM will be more accurate than prior EHRs-based systems. This study will also generate important data to study the social and behavioral determinants of health among many other potential contributing factors that results in ethnic-racial and geographic disparities of the diabetes, at both individual (e.g., individual health behaviors) and contextual levels (e.g., area-level access to metabolic control programs).

"Identification of Early Metabolomic and Immune Endotypes of Allergy and Asthma: An Integrated Multiomics Approach PROJECT SUMMARY Metabolic dysregulation due to in utero and early-life environmental exposures has lasting consequences on the developing immune system and lung and that these changes underlie the pathobiology of childhood atopy and wheeze. However, significant gaps remain in understanding the dysregulated metabolic-immune pathways and mechanisms involved in early childhood atopy and wheeze. Our preliminary study of the infant untargeted metabolome demonstrated that dysregulation in the unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) and lipid mediator's pathway are associated with number of wheeze episodes in a dose-response manner, which suggests the involvement of endogenous antioxidant and lipid mediator pathways. In another preliminary study of the infant immunome, we demonstrated that two distinct infant immune response profiles to acute respiratory infection, with an immune response pattern characterized by increased Type-2 and Type-17 and decreased non-interferon Type- 1 immune responses to with increased risk of recurrent wheeze. While these single omics studies can identify dysregulated metabolites and immune-responses in wheeze phenotypes, they alone fail to capture the full spectrum of underlying pathobiology. The integration of omics data has advanced the understanding of other chronic disease pathogenesis, as it is likely to do for childhood atopy and wheeze. Therefore, we hypothesize that the integration of early-life metabolome (including lipidome) and immunome can elucidate molecular pathways relevant to atopy and wheeze development. To test this hypothesis, the candidate will capitalize on existing carefully phenotyped population-based birth cohort of healthy infants (INSPIRE) and a replication cohort from the NIH ECHO initiative (ECHO-CREW asthma consortium) and accomplish the following specific aims: 1) To investigate whether increased unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) levels reduce early life atopy and wheeze incidence by enhancing the bioavailability of pro-resolving lipid mediators and antioxidants and decreasing pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, 2) To discover novel immunome profiles and network modules that characterize atopy and wheeze phenotypes, and 3) To uncover novel metabolic-immune molecular pathways associated with the development of atopy and wheeze phenotypes by integrating metabolome and immunome data. Successful completion of these aims will: (1) provide novel insights into the role of the early- life metabolome and immunome in the pathogenesis of atopy and wheeze and (2) identify targets for disease prevention. The proposal builds on the candidate's previous work, expertise, and interest in systems approaches to understand disease development. The goal of this career development proposal is for the candidate to emerge as an independent investigator in the field of asthma and allergy with unique knowledge and application of systems approaches to understand disease mechanisms. The candidate is in an outstanding academic environment, has a well thought out training and research plan, which will propel him into an independent expert in the field of immuno-metabolism of atopy and asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early life metabolic dysregulation has lasting consequences on the developing infant immune system and lung, and these changes likely underlie the pathobiology of childhood atopy and wheeze (an early manifestation of allergy and asthma). Knowledge gaps remain in understanding the pathobiological mechanisms of atopy and wheeze phenotypes, which the proposed study aims to address by computationally integrating metabolome and immune response data to identify molecular pathways relevant to the pathobiology of atopic and wheeze phenotypes.

"A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS ABSTRACT Childhood obesity remains epidemic and is most prevalent in minorities. Obese children have a higher risk for developing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with an estimated prevalence of 50%, compared to the general pediatric population with a known prevalence of 2-4%. OSAS carries with it significant neurocognitive, cardiovascular, and metabolic derangements. Additionally, obese children do not respond well to treatment such as adenotonsillectomy or weight loss with residual OSAS exceeding 50%. Despite progress that has been made in recent years to understand the anatomical and functional attributes of OSAS in children, the precise mechanism leading to the disorder remains unknown in the majority of obese children, hindering the development of efficacious treatments. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to implement state-of-the-art dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and image analytics using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and biomechanical modeling, to establish the biomechanical basis that leads to OSAS or protects from it, in naïve and treated children with obesity. NARRATIVE Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common and difficult to treat disorder in obese children and leads to significant medical consequences. We still do not understand why some obese children suffer from this disorder while other do not. The current study will use advance imaging analytical tools combined with biomechanical models to better understand the causes of the disorder and ways to improve outcomes of treatment in these children.",A Computational Biomechanical Airway Model for Obese Children at Risk for OSAS,9947999,R01HL130468,"['17 year old', '3-Dimensional', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilator', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Muscle', 'Nasopharynx', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obesity', 'Object Attachment', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'ROC Curve', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tonsil', 'Treatment outcome', 'analytical tool', 'automated segmentation', 'awake', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiometabolism', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pharyngeal critical pressure', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'response', 'standard care', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,740371,0.025287160055924133
"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5  percent of school-­aged children in the US. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of children with FASD and their  families can access FASD-­informed interventions due to significant systems-­ and family-­level barriers.  Research suggests that self-­directed and peer-­to-­peer interventions are acceptable to families and can lead to  significant improvements in parenting, child behavior, and resource utilization. Advancements in technology  are facilitating more accessible and interactive methods for self-­directed education and support. The proposed  project will develop and evaluate the efficacy of a novel mobile health (mHealth) application (“app”) to directly  provide caregivers with evidence-­based content and peer-­moderated support they can easily access and use  to improve outcomes for their children and families. The app, currently called “FMF Connect,” will be derived  from the scientifically-­validated Families Moving Forward (FMF) Program and will build on existing frameworks  for the development of medical apps. This project will follow a systematic approach to the development and  evaluation of the FMF Connect mHealth intervention, including a small-­scale feasibility trial (n=30), and a  larger-­scale hybrid implementation-­effectiveness trial (n=120) with caregivers raising children (ages 3-­12) with  FASD. Implementation data will aid in identifying the patterns of app usage that relate to the greatest  improvements in child and caregiver outcomes. Study hypotheses are: 1) that caregivers will find the FMF  Connect intervention acceptable, with easy to access content and encouraging support from peer-­moderators;;  2) that greater usage of specific intervention components will relate to larger improvements in child and  caregiver outcomes;; 3) that caregivers who receive the FMF Connect intervention will have larger gains on  child and caregiver outcomes relative to a waitlist comparison group;; and 4) that an increase in  neurodevelopmental attributions for behavior will mediate intervention-­related improvements in parenting  efficacy and child behavior. Project findings will guide further app development both in terms of content and  technological advances to optimize intervention effects. Results of this study will further the overall strategic  aims of the Collaborative Initiative on FASD (CIFASD), which are to inform and develop effective interventions

"Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents Asthma self‐management is essential for preventing exacerbations and reducing the burden of the disease. However, poor adherence to prescribed treatment and poor recognition of symptoms leads to reduced asthma control, particularly among adolescents. Studies show that adolescents lack understanding about self‐management, and that asthma education during clinic visits is deficient, resulting in insufficient asthma management. Mobile technology, specifically, mobile applications (or apps) are an efficient way to increase patient‐provider communication, provide feedback on asthma management, and deliver asthma education. Our pilot work has demonstrated that an app can be effective at improving asthma control in adolescents aged 12‐17, and that adolescents are enthusiastic about utilizing mHealth technologies for asthma management, but that existing apps are not engaging or appealing enough to an adolescent population to sustain long‐term use. For this pilot study, we will test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self‐management in order to obtain data necessary to complete a future large efficacy trial of the app in adolescents with persistent asthma. The objective of this project is to use an agile, iterative, user‐centered design process to tailor our existing proof of concept app to adolescent user preferences and to use a mixed‐ methods approach to test feasibility, acceptability, adherence, and preliminary efficacy. The long‐term goal is to identify mHealth technological approaches that facilitate self‐management of chronic diseases, particularly among adolescents, and to develop marketing strategies to promote long‐term support of these approaches. The rationale for this project is that adolescents are quick to adopt mobile technologies, have a high degree of smartphone use, and are at a point of transition from parental management of their chronic condition to self‐ management, making this a priority population for the development of interventions targeting asthma control. For this project, we have two specific aims: 1) To refine an asthma self‐management app for adolescents with persistent asthma; and 2) To assess feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to the app in a small randomized controlled trial. The approach is innovative because we are incorporating a user‐centered design process to integrate multiple components for facilitating asthma self‐management in a mHealth tool tailored for adolescents within the Technology Acceptance Model framework. Despite studies showing that mHealth tools can be effective, few have prioritized an adolescent audience or evaluated the tool compared to standard of care using rigorous, mixed‐method approaches. This research is significant because asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood in the US and the prevalence of the condition continues to rise, and so innovative tools to improve self‐management of the disease are critically needed. Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood, which makes the proposed research a significant public health burden. This pilot is designed to test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self-management among adolescents with persistent asthma. Knowledge gained from this pilot study will be used to design and conduct a future efficacy trial of the app. This project addresses the mission of NHLBI by developing a novel intervention to treat asthma. This study leverages our formative and pilot work to continue making strides towards enhancing asthma control among adolescents with persistent asthma in order to reduce asthma-related morbidity.",Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents,9824678,R34HL145442,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'African American', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Florida', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Information System', 'Hispanics', 'Incentives', 'Inhalators', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sample Size', 'Self Management', 'Smoking', 'Social Change', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Work', 'age group', 'aged', 'arm', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient-clinician communication', 'peak flow measurement', 'preference', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'user centered design']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R34,2020,181719,0.027330443700039828
"Innovative Method for Real-time Assessment of Intracranial Compliance ""Standard of care"" neurological monitoring for patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) - a leading cause of death and long-term neurological impairment in children and adults-has not changed in decades, relying mainly on intracranial pressure {ICP) monitoring. Remarkably, the use of ICP alone as a therapeutic target for severe TBI is currently controversial due to a lack of robust supporting evidence, especially for its use in children. To address this clinical need, we developed the ICP-PC02 Compliance Index (ICP-PCI), an algorithm to compute dynamic intracranial compliance in real-time by integrating continuous ICP and end tidal CO, (ETC02) data streams. Bedside assessment of intracranial compliance-the relationship between changes in ICP and concomitant changes in intracranial volume, has been limited because of the lack of point-of-care devices to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF)/cerebral blood volume (CBV). The ICP-PCI is based on the well-known and robust relationship between the partial pressure of CO2 in blood (PC02) and CBV, where a change in PC02 of 1 mmHg induces an -3% change in CBF in patients with severe TBI. Since CBF is proportional to blood vessel radius to the fourth power, changes in CBF reflect immediate changes in CBV. As continuous ICP and ETC02 monitoring are standard of care for patients with severe TBI, ICP-PCI can be determined using existing ICU monitoring. To date we have obtained preliminary data in children with severe TBI in an IRB approved study that validates the physiologic premise and demonstrates feasibility for measurement of ICPPCI using existing, continuous ICU monitoring deemed guidelines-based standard of care. In this proposal, dense time series data, including continuous ETC02, ICP, and other physiologic waveforms will be interrogated. ICP-PCI will be calculated as the running moment-to-moment correlation between ETC02 and ICP across optimized temporal epochs, and subject to additional signal processing. We will confirm our findings across a larger cohort and define the temporal pattern of ICP-PCI and associations with relevant clinical variables: ICP, CPP, duration of ICP monitoring, medical and surgical interventions, and ICU and hospital length of stay. In addition, high-density, time series data will be integrated and time-synchronized with electronic health record (EHR) data and simulation models will be generated and refined to define the capacity for ICP-PCI to predict the need and response to relevant medical and surgical interventions. Clinical application of ICP-PCI will be compared head-to-head with ICP alone. Successful validation of ICP-PCI would lay the groundwork for the development of a valuable clinical tool for all Centers managing children and possibly adults with severe TBI, that could be readily integrated and implemented using existing ICU monitoring.

"A Learning Health System Approach to Precision Sedation and Analgesia in Critically-Ill Children PROJECT ABSTRACT Approximately 500,000 children suffer critical illness every year in the United States and more than one third will receive a continuous infusion of a sedative-analgesic medication such as an opioid or dexmedetomidine. Such drugs are commonly administered to ease the burden of critical illness by treating serious pain and anxiety associated with invasive organ support delivery and procedures in the intensive care unit. However, there are no widely-accepted standards for the administration of these potent neuroactive medications and several studies have demonstrated that children receive too little or too much of these medications nearly half of the time they are administered. This imprecision in conventional dosing strategies leads to adverse events, including acute physiologic deterioration, drug tolerance and dependency, prolonged illness and hospitalization and life-threatening complications of invasive support such as unplanned extubation and post-extubation airway obstruction. Evidence also indicates that relatively short exposures to these medications may be detrimental to long-term neurodevelopment. More precise strategies for administering these medications to children are needed and this is an issue of major  PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinicians caring for critically ill children routinely struggle to harmonize the tension between giving too much versus too little sedation-analgesia. This work will (1) identify patterns of sedation-analgesia associated with outcome; (2) identify genotypes associated with sedation-analgesia administration; (3) characterize PK parameters of common sedative-analgesic mediations; and (4) promote the development of the PI as an independent Learning Health System researcher.

"Images of Children and Adults for Health Research Abstract: This project's goal of expanding the extant archive for a major longitudinal study to include an innovative collection of images of children and adults is well-aligned with the initiative (PAR-16-149) to support the archiving of NICHD-funded data sets for secondary data analyses. The longitudinal study was funded through a U01 partnership with NICHD, and the images that will be added to its archive can take longitudinal and intergenerational health research in significantly new directions. As background, the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD) was a major investment of NICHD in a longitudinal study of children and parents. The observational, survey, medical, biological, and video data from the NICHD- sponsored data collection over 15 years are archived at the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), with data collection on the now-adult sample ongoing. A current R01 project by the PIs of this proposal has developed a systematic process for extracting and rating “short slice” images of children and parents from videos. This system has resulted in short slices of children at 11 time points, short slices of mothers at four time points, and ratings of the attractiveness of their faces and bodies at all these time points. The child ratings—along with a detailed codebook—are already being added to the SECCYD archive through the current R01 so that health scholars licensed with ICPSR can merge them with the SECCYD for analyses of child and adolescent development. The proposed R03 would allow a substantial and valuable expansion by also archiving the actual short slices of children, extracting short slices of mothers at the remaining time points, extracting the short slices of fathers at the five time points they were videotaped, and adding all of these short slices to the archive along with expanded codebooks. The PIs are partnering with ICPSR to open up their secure system for housing and organizing these images so that other researchers could use them for their own purposes and not have to travel to the ICSPR data enclave. Such an enterprise would exploit the original R01 project to realize substantial economies of scale in creating a resource for health research to inform a wide array of health and health-relevant literatures. Indeed, a substantial body of research has documented the valid and reliable ways that images of the face and body can be used. For example, scholars could access this expanded SECCYD archive to examine the development of health conditions (e.g., obesity), the corrosive effects of disadvantage on health (e.g., the physical toll of poverty), the link between social stigmas and health (e.g., colorism and depression), family health dynamics (e.g., disjunctures in health of parents and children), and other important questions concerning individual and population health. They can also go beyond human rating to exploit new machine scoring techniques that enable measurements beyond the human eye that provide insights into biological processes (e.g., hormone levels, sexual dimorphism). The codebooks will also provide a template for other scholars to expand their own NIH-funded data collections or to launch new ones. Project Narrative In response to a NICHD funding opportunity on archiving datasets, this project will significantly contribute to a number of fields of health research by archiving an expansive longitudinal set of images of the faces and bodies of children and their parents over a 15 year period. With a secure system to facilitate ease of access and use, such images can be human rated (e.g., perceived age, weight, skin color) and machine scored (e.g., biologically informative facial measurements) to measure continuity and change in physical development and health and to capture the physical toll of the environment on individual wellbeing. Extending a prior NICHD- funded project that rated 11 waves of videos from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development to longitudinally study children's appearance, this larger archive of images will provide a valuable resource for researchers aiming to conduct innovative research on health and health disparities.",Images of Children and Adults for Health Research,9923679,R03HD096203,"['Academic achievement', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Appearance', 'Archives', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Birds', 'Birth', 'Catalogs', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Corrosives', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline', 'Documentation', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Family health status', 'Fathers', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Guidelines', 'Half-Life', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health Status', 'Hormones', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investments', 'Licensing', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nose', 'Obesity', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Slice', 'Social Environment', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'base', 'data archive', 'data enclave', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'image archival system', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'middle age', 'population health', 'recruit', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sexual dimorphism', 'skin color', 'social', 'social engagement', 'social implication', 'social stigma', 'transmission process']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2020,83342,0.013765463400399362
"Inflammation Phenotypes in Pediatric Sepsis Induced Multiple Organ Failure Renewal Carcillo R01 Project Abstract Every year over 1 million American adults and children develop overwhelming infection leading to a rotting of their body we call ‘sepsis’, and death in up to 1 of 3 afflicted (www.nigms.nih.gov>NIGMS Home>Science Education). National efforts emphasizing early recognition, intravenous fluids to help organs, and antibiotics to kill infection, have reduced mortality so that now 1 of 4 die. We and others have asked the question “why do patients continue to die despite these national efforts?’ In the previous funding period we showed in 401 children with sepsis that those who developed organ shut down despite these efforts, did so because they were a) unable to fight germs causing unending infection, b) unable to stop clotting off their body causing kidney failure, and/or c) unable to kill viruses causing liver failure; all of which led to death from uncontrolled inflammation with clotting, bleeding and liver failure. Fortunately, each of these organ shutdown groups has hopeful treatments. With the new information we collected in the previous funding period we have already designed and started clinical trials testing these treatments including immune boosters for children unable to kill germs, plasma removal and replacement using plasma exchange for children unable to stop clotting, monoclonal antibodies to kill viruses and their homes to reverse liver failure in children unable to do so on their own, and anti-inflammatory proteins to reverse uncontrollable inflammation, in hopes of helping save many of the 1 of 4 children still dying from sepsis related organ shutdown. In this next funding period, we propose to use the clinical information and samples already obtained in our previous study to take advantage of the wonderful advances made this millenia in computer technology, big data, bioinformatics, and the study of human and virus genetics to perform Specific Aim 1) use a ‘Watson’ like approach to ask the computer to help us figure out if the children with sepsis have any other causes of organ shutdown that we can help, Specific Aim 2) use an ‘Ancestry.com’-like or ‘23 and me’-like approach to identify ‘precision medicine’ therapies for causes of organ shutdown that we can treat on a patient by patient basis, and Specific Aim 3) use a bedside molecular biology test approach to identify individualized therapies to kill DNA viruses and reduce cytokine inflammation. We think that DNA viruses are the unappreciated co-infection which causes uncontrolled cytokine inflammation and leads to organ shutdown. Our long term objective is to plan ‘precision’ medicine and ‘individualized’ medicine clinical trials testing therapies on an individual patient basis in order to further reduce death from sepsis organ shutdown in children. Carcillo R01 Narrative Statement Every year over 1 million American adults and children develop overwhelming infection leading to a rotting of their body we call ‘sepsis’, and death in up to 1 of 4 afflicted (www.nigms.nih.gov>NIGMS Home>Science Education). In our previous funding period we showed that this occurs when groups of patients are unable to kill germs, stop clotting or bleeding, or stop viruses from reproducing, and we have therefore designed and begun clinical trials to help these children do so. In this new funding period we are using ‘Watson’-like, ‘Twenty three and me’-like, and ‘Ancestry.com’-like approaches to figure out how to help each child with individually tailored treatments that are best at helping them live long and happy lives.",Inflammation Phenotypes in Pediatric Sepsis Induced Multiple Organ Failure Renewal,10017690,R01GM108618,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adenoviruses', 'Adult', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Coagulation Process', 'Complement', 'Computers', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'DNA', 'DNA Viruses', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Excision', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Germ', 'Hemorrhage', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Home environment', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Human Herpesvirus 6', 'IV Fluid', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Interleukin-1', 'Interleukin-18', 'Interleukin-6', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Liver Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Macrophage activation syndrome', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Natural Immunity', 'Organ', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Units', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Exchange', 'Precision medicine trial', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Viremia', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'exome', 'fighting', 'gene interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'recruit', 'science education', 'septic patients', 'targeted treatment', 'trial design', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,500320,0.04982520752120212
"A bench to population epidemiologic approach to investigating the effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child gut inflammation, growth, and development PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Lin is a research scientist at the University of California, Berkeley in Professor John (Jack) Colford's group. She completed her PhD in Microbiology and Immunology at Stanford University in 2012. Since 2010, she has worked as the coordinating microbiologist for the WASH Benefits study, a large-scale, multi- country cluster randomized trial evaluating the impact of water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutritional interventions on child health, with a focus on gut inflammation. This research and training plan builds on her strong interdisciplinary background at the nexus of microbiology, immunology, and global health. Gaining experience in epidemiology and biostatistics will facilitate her transition to a `bench to population' independent investigator at UC Berkeley and will ultimately enable her to achieve her long-term career goal to become a global health leader in the evaluation of antenatal and early life interventions to improve child health. Environment: UC Berkeley has a long history of conducting innovative and groundbreaking research advancing epidemiological and biostatistical theory and application in international health. To achieve her career goal, Dr. Lin seeks training in (1) epidemiology, with a focus on causal inference methods (in particular, marginal structural models for direct and indirect effects and targeted maximum likelihood estimation) (2) biostatistics and (3) child stress and development. To achieve these goals, Dr. Lin has assembled a unique interdisciplinary training and mentoring team based at UC Berkeley. Jack Colford (primary mentor) will guide her training in epidemiological theory and application. Alan Hubbard (co-mentor) will guide her training in biostatistics and causal inference methods including models for direct and indirect effects and targeted maximum likelihood estimation. Lia Fernald (co-mentor) will guide her training in child development and stress. Research Project: Early life linear growth faltering is associated with impaired development, but its underlying pathogenesis is poorly understood. Subclinical intestinal inflammation and damage affects children living in low-income countries and is increasingly recognized as a potential main contributor to the vicious cycle of early life malnutrition and oral vaccine failure. Little is known about the pregnancy risk factors associated with gut inflammation and the impact of these antenatal factors on linear growth and neurodevelopment. In Aim 1, Dr. Lin will determine the association between maternal stress and inflammation during pregnancy and subsequent measures of child gut inflammation and permeability. In Aim 2, she will evaluate the relationship between antenatal stress and inflammation and future child linear growth and development. She proposes to use modern causal inference methods to elucidate the potential pathways from antenatal stress and inflammation to child gut inflammation, linear growth faltering, and poor development. Ultimately, this mentored research will prepare Dr. Lin for a successful R01-level application to investigate potential downstream effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child stress, inflammation, and susceptibility to infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Widely pervasive subclinical inflammation and damage of the small intestine is observed in children living in low-income countries and is increasingly recognized as a potential main contributor to the vicious cycle of early life malnutrition and oral vaccine failure. Little is known about the pregnancy risk factors associated with gut inflammation and permeability and the impact of these antenatal factors on linear growth and neurodevelopment in infants from low-income countries. Understanding these critical pathways will be an important contribution to public health because it will enable the identification of key biological markers to identify prospectively at-risk children, to evaluate the efficacy of interventions, and to suggest potential intervention targets to improve child linear growth and development trajectories; we propose to use modern causal inference methods to elucidate these critical pathways in children living in rural Bangladesh.","A bench to population epidemiologic approach to investigating the effects of antenatal stress and inflammation on child gut inflammation, growth, and development",9989761,K01AI136885,"['5 year old', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Bangladesh', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'C-reactive protein', 'California', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Country', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'F2-Isoprostanes', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Handwashing', 'Health', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hygiene', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Lactulose', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Mannitol', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neopterin', 'Nutritional', 'Observational Study', 'Orosomucoid', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peroxidases', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Sanitation', 'Scientist', 'Small Intestines', 'Stress', 'Structural Models', 'Surface', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Villous Atrophy', 'Water', 'Work', 'absorption', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin', 'antenatal', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'career', 'cytokine', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'global health', 'improved', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'innovation', 'low income country', 'maternal stress', 'neurodevelopment', 'oral vaccine', 'prevent', 'professor', 'prospective', 'repository', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'therapy development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2020,135454,0.026191490210086637
"Linking State Medicaid and Congenital Heart Surgical Registry Data: Building Capacity to Assess Disparities in Longitudinal Outcomes and Value for Children with Congenital Heart Disease Project Summary Congenital heart defects are the most common and resource intensive birth defects managed in the United States with high morbidity and mortality. They are estimated to effect over 1 million US children and 1.4 million US adults and to result in ~200,000 life-years lost and >$6 billion in inpatient acute care costs per year. Significant disparities are known to exist in short-term outcomes and resource utilization. We have shown that children from low income neighborhoods have 18% higher risk-adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality, have 7% longer lengths-of-stay, and require 7% more perioperative resources than do children from higher income neighborhoods, even after controlling for the effects of race, public versus private insurance provider, and the hospitals at which these children ultimately receive surgical repair. Research on long-term outcomes and health expenditures is limited and mechanisms driving health inequities remain unknown. Greater than 50% of children with congenital heart disease are covered by Medicaid. We have partnered with the NY Department of Health and have clean, validated data for all Medicaid patient encounters over 15 years across NY State. We have developed methods of abstracting and linking locally-held clinical registry data to Medicaid files and have built an interdisciplinary team of pediatric cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, health services researchers, health economists, and NY Department of Health senior leadership to identify dimensions of healthcare access that could be targeted through center- or state-level interventions to reduce inequities. We propose linking pediatric cardiac surgical clinical registry data from across NY State, longitudinal Medicaid claims, Census Bureau data, geocoded data, and the National Death Index. We will use these data to accomplish the following Aims: 1) We will define 10-year risk-stratified, multi-dimensional outcomes (mortality and morbidities) and associated health expenditures for children undergoing congenital heart surgery across New York State; 2) we will develop novel longitudinal risk models for children with congenital heart disease that adjust for social determinants of health, and 3) we will test dimensions of healthcare access as modifiable drivers of health inequities among children in New York with congenital heart disease on Medicaid. Achieving our aims would 1) establish a comprehensive, population-based resource for longitudinal outcomes and health expenditure research, inclusive of not only in-patient data, but also out-patient, emergency room, pharmacy, rehabilitation, home healthcare, education records, and neighborhood-level social determinants of health for nearly half of all children undergoing congenital heart surgery in NY State, 2) generate a methodology for investigations on long-term outcomes and value applicable across multiple populations, 3) assess constructs of access as modifiable mediators of social determinants of health, and 4) position us to translate these findings into policy and care changes to reduce health inequities. Project Narrative Congenital heart defects are the most common and resource intensive birth defects managed in the United States, estimated to effect over 1 million US children and 1.4 million US adults and to result in ~200,000 life- years lost and >$6 billion in inpatient acute care costs per year, with significantly worse outcomes for children from lower income neighborhoods and minorities. Despite the high prevalence, research on long-term outcomes and health expenditures is limited and etiologies of health inequities remain unknown. Linking clinical registries with longitudinal state-wide Medicaid data will 1) build a scalable resource that will allow us to assess longitudinal outcomes and resource requirements at a population level 2) generate a methodology for investigations on long-term outcomes and value, 3) assess constructs of access as modifiable mediators of social determinants of health, and 4) immediately inform policy and care.",Linking State Medicaid and Congenital Heart Surgical Registry Data: Building Capacity to Assess Disparities in Longitudinal Outcomes and Value for Children with Congenital Heart Disease,9864807,R01HL150044,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Ratios', 'Birth', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Child Mortality', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Congresses', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Expenditure', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Services', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Home Care Services', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Insurance', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'New York', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Surgeon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'abstracting', 'acute care', 'care costs', 'college', 'congenital heart disorder', 'cost', 'data registry', 'disorder subtype', 'follow-up', 'health care availability', 'health care service', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'neonatal surgery', 'novel', 'pediatric cardiologist', 'population based', 'repaired', 'social determinants', 'social health determinants', 'years of life lost']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,495156,0.028207150092996985
