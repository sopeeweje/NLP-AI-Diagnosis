"Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing Project Summary  Safety net providers treat a substantial share of socioeconomically vulnerable patients in their communities, but struggle to provide timely access to high quality specialty care for their patients. Delayed access to specialty care is associated with worse health outcomes and potentially contributes to health disparities across socioeconomic groups. Given their limited resources, safety net providers must seek creative approaches to improve specialty access. However, to choose what programs to implement, safety net providers need to understand the specialty care needs of their populations. Fortunately, the adoption of eConsult systems by safety net providers across the US provides a valuable opportunity to systematically measure patterns of specialty care referrals for minority, underserved populations.  In this project, we propose using state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to help safety net providers extract actionable, population wide data from their electronic consultation systems. We will do this in partnership with three of the most prominent safety net health systems in the US in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Using specialty request databases from our collaborators, we will build NLP systems to automatically classify specialty requests along two dimensions: the “clinical issue” motivating the request (e.g., chest pain), and the “question type” (e.g., request for a procedure, help with medication management). This automated classification of electronic specialty requests can enable identification of promising targets for interventions to improve specialty access and quality of care.  After developing these NLP systems, we will analyze >1 million specialty requests to describe trends in how safety net patients are referred to specialists and examine variation in referral patterns by clinic and individual provider. The goal is to identify the most impactful opportunities to improve specialty access and quality. For example, a high rate of referrals for esophageal reflux, which most PCPs can treat on their own with specialist guidance, could lead to new treatment algorithms, potentially reducing the need for these requests and improving access for other patients.  This proposal is a “high-risk high-reward” project that creates new research tools to identify and evaluate data-driven interventions to improve specialty care delivery for underserved populations. Project Narrative Access to timely, high-quality specialty care is a fundamental component of a well-functioning health system, yet safety net health care providers face persistent challenges delivering such care. Quality improvement efforts to improve specialty access have been thwarted in part because safety net providers lack the data to understand a basic question – why patients are referred for specialty care. Taking advantage of the growing use of electronic specialty referral systems by safety net providers, we propose using natural language processing to conduct automated analysis and classification of specialty requests in safety net populations, which will enable the design of targeted interventions to improve specialty care access and delivery.",Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing,9789060,R21MD012693,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Chest Pain', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consultations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Hospitals', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Telemedicine', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Triage', 'Underserved Population', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'automated analysis', 'care delivery', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'ethnic minority population', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'safety net', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'trend', 'two-dimensional']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2019,94263,0.0018507210375261207
"Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only one in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest costs are hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with daily life activities. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs, reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, no fall detection and prevention technology has been developed specifically for the needs of dementia care where individuals (1) fall more frequently and (2) often cannot tell care staff how they fell, leading to increased use of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) when falls are unwitnessed to ensure affected individuals are safe. Our goal is to perform a randomized wait-list control clinical trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for residents with AD and related dementias (ADRD). The automation is based on algorithms that push the frontier of deep learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a human-in-the- loop (HIL). SafelyYou Guardian is designed to primarily operate in memory care facilities (defined herein as assisted living and skilled nursing facilities providing ADRD care). Deep learning has already revolutionized several fields: robotics, self-driving cars, social networks in particular. Our approach is anchored in novel algorithms developed at the Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR) and extended by SafelyYou for real-time detection of rare events in video. The HIL is operating from a call center, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the communities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection. Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) working from our office in San Francisco reviews the fall videos with the front-line staff over video conference and using our web portal to make recommendations on how to re-organize the resident space (intervention) to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning approach identifies and pre-filters falls with high sensitivity followed by a human who confirms the fall with high specificity and calls the communities in case of detected fall. This project leverages past small scale clinical and technical pilots including 87 residents from 11 partner communities, and our experience with paid commitments for 480 residents from three partner networks. Past pilots leading to this NIH Phase II proposal include:  · Pilot 1: Technical proof of concept with healthy subjects (200 acted falls).  · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by residents, family and  staff, through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, our first  partner facility; we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to clinical benefits  including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of OT. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11  communities, for 87 residents monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4: Small scale NIH Phase I clinical trial. We demonstrated the ability to perform real-time fall detection, with real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions which provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities. We demonstrated that 93% of 89 falls were detected, that time on the ground was reduced by 42%, that the likelihood of EMS use was 50% lower with video available, and the that total facility falls including participants and non-participants decreased by 38%. The trial proposed for this NIH SBIR Phase II will provide clinical evidence that the preliminary trends observed experimentally (pilot 2) and at small scale (pilot 4) are true phenomena. It will use a wait-list control population (230 residents) to be compared to the population monitored with SafelyYou Guardian (230 residents). After crossover, the wait-list population will also benefit from the technology and be compared to itself before crossover. Narrative The goal of this project is to perform a randomized, wait-list controlled trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection and prevention system for memory care facilities (defined here as skilled nursing and assisted living facilities providing dementia care). The technology applies breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to video data collected from off- the-shelf, wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls from video for residents with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); it enables care staff (1) to know about falls right away without requiring residents wear a device, (2) to use video review to quickly assess need for emergency medical services (EMS) after unwitnessed falls, and (3) to perform accurate incident review with support from a remote occupational therapist (OT) to assess how to reduce the risk of repeat falls. The Phase I project goal of launching this service at small scale was achieved and demonstrated with 11 memory care facilities (1) 93% of 89 falls detected, generating 1 alarm per camera per 15 days, (2) 37% reduction in EMS use through better understanding of risk when residents with dementia were found on the floor, and (3) 38% reduction in falls through reduced risk of repeat falls following OT video review.",Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video,9776678,R44AG058354,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Family', 'Floor', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health care facility', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Notification', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'Series', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'care costs', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'dementia care', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'frontier', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'trend', 'web portal']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R44,2019,493633,0.006960622221266162
"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,9724447,K08DE027720,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Health Services', 'Dentists', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural experiment', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'decision tree learning', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'econometrics', 'evidence base', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'payment', 'population health', 'population survey', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'relative effectiveness', 'supervised learning']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2019,130717,0.026771433180609715
"Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare Project Summary With newly available electronic health data and a massive increase in processing power, data-driven personalized medicine is just now becoming possible.1 However, advances to improve health care are inherently limited by data quality. One of the most used sources of data, the patient problem list, is also the greatest source of data inaccuracy. According to recent studies, the patient problem list is often less than 50% accurate in documenting the most critical conditions.2 3 4 5 These errors exacerbate inefficiencies throughout the American health care system from care delivery to quality improvement. Primary care physicians rely on problem lists to develop transitional treatment plans for the 68 million Americans who change providers every year. Errors related to care transitions harm more than 1.5 million people each year in the United States, costing the nation an estimated $3.5 billion annually.6 Population health efforts, a cornerstone of value-based healthcare, rely on problem lists to determine risk levels and deployment of resources. These efforts cannot succeed if the source data produce faulty results. This application seeks to enable better individual patient care, enhanced population health management, and effective downstream analytics by building an automated problem list builder, which provides an accurate and granular account of the patient’s medical conditions. If the program is successful, one of the greatest technical risks in value-based healthcare will be addressed. Phase I exceeded success criteria in proving feasibility of core modules in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence. Based on Phase I success, implementation pathways are demonstrated through pilots with one of the largest US healthcare systems and one of the largest global biotechnology firms. The team is comprised of commercial and academic leaders in the field of NLP-based products applied to value-based healthcare. Project Narrative VMT proposes to use advanced semantic technologies and artificial intelligence to enhance the individualized patient problem list, which frequently has 50% or lower accuracy for common conditions such as cancer, smoking, and heart failure. 1 2 3 The problem list represents source data in care delivery, population health, shared-risk contracting, and research.

"Transforming residential palliative care for persons with dementia through behavioral economics and data science The central goal of this proposed Roybal Center is to develop, test, and implement novel interventions that bridge the dramatic gap between the supply of and need for palliative care services among persons with dementia (PWD) living in long-term services and support (LTSS) facilities, as well as their family caregivers. Several innovative aspects of this proposed Center position us to succeed in this challenging but increasingly important space. First, we have assembled a team comprising more 50 investigators and staff from 5 schools within the University of Pennsylvania, and the most accomplished investigators of palliative approaches to care for PWD from 11 peer institutions. These investigators possess content knowledge and tremendous expertise in leading all Stages of behavioral intervention development as defined by the NIH Stage Model. Second, we will support these behavioral scientists by linking them with Center faculty with expertise in several key methodologic areas including behavioral economics, data science, statistics, qualitative methods, health policy and economics, and implementation science. Our focus on translating behavioral economic insights to change the behaviors of clinicians and caregivers involved in the care of PWD builds on our recent success using similar approaches to improve palliative care delivery in outpatient and hospital settings. Our focus on using machine learning, natural language processing, and network methods will enable us to (a) identify mechanisms of clinician behavior that account for aggressive care for PWD, (b) identify PWD with the greatest unmet palliative care needs so as to sustainably target intervention delivery, and (c) more efficiently measure person-centered outcomes in the context of large, pragmatic trials of the most promising interventions. Third, this Center is being launched in partnership with Genesis HealthCare, the nation's largest owner of LTSS facilities, with 401 nursing homes and assisted living facilities across the U.S. These facilities provide ideal settings within which to develop and test interventions that will be effective and sustainable in the real world. Further, by developing and testing the interventions in these settings, while continually increasing our collaborations with other owners of LTSS facilities, we will be ideally positioned to implement effective interventions in the places in which the majority of Americans with dementia are cared for near the end of life. This Center will be directed by a Steering Committee, and will include a Management and Administrative Core housed within Penn's existing Palliative and Advanced Illness Research (PAIR) Center. A Pilot Core will select, guide, and monitor pilot projects chosen for funding each year. We propose two pilots for funding in the first year: a Stage I study that seeks to adapt a web-based advance care planning platform for use among PWD and their caregivers in LTSS settings, and a Stage 0 study that will use data science methods to identify clinician behaviors associated with hospitalization risk among PWD, yielding targets for future interventions. NARRATIVE Although most persons with dementia (PWD) die in nursing homes and other long-term services and support (LTSS) facilities, few interventions have improved the processes or outcomes of care for such patients. This Roybal Center will unite junior and senior physician, nurse, and social scientists with expertise in Stages 0-V behavioral intervention studies, behavioral economics, and data science with a shared goal to develop, test, and implement interventions to change the behaviors of clinicians and caregivers for PWD in LTSS facilities. We will achieve this goal by partnering with the nation's leading researchers in palliative care for PWD and the largest owner of nursing homes, using its facilities as sites for the pilot studies we will support.",Transforming residential palliative care for persons with dementia through behavioral economics and data science,9810433,P30AG064105,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Advance Care Planning', 'American', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family Nursing', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Process', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Site', 'Social Network', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'care systems', 'caregiver interventions', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy study', 'electronic data', 'end of life', 'health economics', 'hospice environment', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'palliative', 'peer', 'person centered', 'pragmatic trial', 'social', 'statistics', 'success', 'symptom management', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P30,2019,768436,0.037903802127956666
"CATcare: Cognitive Assistive Technology for Dementia Homecare Project Summary/Abstract Family members with a relative with dementia often face complex, and stressful life situations that many other caregivers do not. Multiple factors make the adjustment to the caregiving role particularly hard, as the caregiver balances this role with other demands, including child rearing, careers, and relationships. For people with dementia, perceptible capabilities, fundamental information-processing capabilities and previously acquired knowledge are generally limited, making it difficult to distinguish relevant information from irrelevant information. Tasks such as making breakfast or teeth brushing may become too difficult to complete independently and an inability to remember events that occurred only a few days, hours, or even minutes previously makes day-to-day decision-making and navigating built environments difficult. The recall of routes and tasks may be unpredictable, therefore caregivers are often left with the constant and repetitive responsibility of prompting and cueing the care recipient, leading to additional stress in their caregiving role. This project aims to develop a low-cost wearable device to improve the quality and sustainability of dementia homecare that is beneficial to both care recipients and caregivers, and potentially create a new paradigm to provide assistance and care to individuals with dementia in a home environment. This innovative cognitive assistive technology, called CATcare, will be specifically designed to provide two-way assistance to the dementia caregiver and care recipient dyad living at home, enabling the individual with dementia more independence and situational awareness in the home setting, as well as improving his or her quality of life with less reliance on the caregiver. Caregivers, on the other hand, will be able to fully program, adjust, and customize the system for a given living environment according to the care recipient’s current habits, needs and conditions. This device can potentially prolong the period that the dementia patients stay at home and age in place, reducing the financial burden to both government and individuals as well as emotional and physical stress to caregivers. The proposed CATcare prototype not only encapsulates the newest hardware innovations (including smartglass and smartphone) but also advanced software solutions (including state-of-the-art image processing, machine learning, computer vision techniques). In conclusion, this project will lead to the integration and development of an affordable, portable and versatile wearable intervention to address the long-standing and fast-growing challenges facing current and future dementia homecare. For individuals with dementia living at home, perceptible capabilities, fundamental information-processing capabilities and tasks such as making breakfast or teeth brushing may become too difficult to complete independently, leading to the responsibility of repetitive prompting and cueing by the caregiver. To improve the quality and sustainability of dementia homecare that is beneficial to both care recipients and caregivers, we propose to create an innovative wearable technology called CATcare which will be designed to provide navigational and cueing assistance to care recipients in the home environment. Our results will help provide a tool for two-way assistance by enabling caregivers to fully program, adjust and customize the system in order to support the individual with dementia with improved situational awareness and timely feedback in the home setting.",CATcare: Cognitive Assistive Technology for Dementia Homecare,9656662,R15AG061833,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child Rearing', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Future', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Route', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social isolation', 'Stress', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toothbrushing', 'United States', 'aging in place', 'built environment', 'care recipients', 'career', 'caregiving', 'cognitive change', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'grasp', 'image processing', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'model design', 'portability', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'smart home', 'synergism', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'user centered design', 'way finding', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIA,OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY STILLWATER,R15,2019,437757,0.008857970543407574
"Automated Health Assessment through Mobile Sensing and Machine Learning of Daily Activities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Advances in health care have been dramatic since the beginning of the millennium. As a result, people are living longer with age-related diseases, and the number of older individuals unable to live independently is rising rapidly. Mobile computing offers an unprecedented opportunity to unobtrusively monitor behavior and use the large amount of collected data to automate analysis of functional health in a person's everyday settings. This project focuses on evaluating the performance and commercial viability of technologies that will meet some of the needs that this coming age wave introduces by automating assessment of a person's functional performance. The primary objective of this Phase I STTR application is to evaluate the feasibility of assessing an individual's cognitive and mobility-based health using behavior patterns as sensed by a smart watch. Achieving this objective will provide a foundation for the Phase II application goal of using multiple information sources to automatically-generate activity scores and functional health measures from sensor data. Building on our prior collaborative work, our approach creates a profile of a person's routine behavior through automated real-time recognition of complex activities from mobile sensor data (Aim 1). We will evaluate the use of machine learning techniques to map behavior features onto cognitive and mobility health scores provided through app and in-person neuropsychological assessment (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate an interactive visual tool for displaying behavior patterns to provide individuals and their caregivers with insights on their routines and relationship with their health status (Aim 3). This work has important health care implications as functional impairment has been associated with negative outcomes including increased health care utilization, falls, and conversion to dementia. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, it is imperative to commercialize technologies that increase functional independence while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to evaluate the performance and commercial viability of an application that can predict an individual's cognitive and mobility-based health based on patterns that are sensed by a smart watch, and effectively and efficiently present this information to the caregiver. This work will lay the foundation for a commercial tool to analyze behavior routines and automate assessment of functional health.

"Identifying palliative care needs among hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease PROJECT SUMMARY Millions of Americans with COPD experience burdensome symptoms, reduced quality of life, and undesirable end-of-life care. Increasing palliative care for this vulnerable population is widely advocated to improve these important patient-centered outcomes. Yet patients with COPD rarely receive palliative care due, in part, to difficulties identifying which patients have unmet palliative care needs and palliative care workforce shortages. The proposed study's core objective is to address the national priority of improving palliative care for patients with COPD by developing an efficient, innovative, and patient-centered method to identify those with unmet palliative care needs. Specifically, the candidate seeks to (1) assess patients with COPD to determine their palliative care needs; (2) develop and validate an electronic health record-based classification model for each domain of palliative care needs; and (3) evaluate the relationship between the probability of having unmet palliative care needs and patient-centered clinical outcomes. The study will involve an in-person cross- sectional survey of 432 hospitalized patients with COPD of any stage. Participants will complete a validated survey to capture a wide variety of palliative care needs, which will be supplemented with expert chart review to identify patients with needs in any of three clinically relevant and actionable domains. These cases will be used as the patient-reported reference standard for development and validation of domain-specific classification models leveraging natural language processing of unstructured clinical text in electronic health records and machine learning methods. Finally, a large, multicenter retrospective cohort study will evaluate the associations between different probabilities of having unmet palliative care needs and several clinical outcomes important to patients, caregivers, and hospitals. This will enable the identification of thresholds of probabilities of unmet needs above which COPD patients' risks of undesirable clinical outcomes increase. Such patients will then be targeted for enrollment in future trials testing interventions to improve these outcomes. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, an F32-supported post-doctoral fellowship, and a career development award from the National Palliative Care Research Center, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. The candidate's rigorous training plan, focused on obtaining advanced skills in multisite prospective research, patient-centered outcomes research, and advanced bioinformatics methods will allow her to submit successful R01 or PCORI applications testing interventions directly informed by the results of this work. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a supportive environment for her to develop an independent research career focused on improving the uptake and effectiveness of palliative care for patients with COPD and other cardiopulmonary diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with COPD experience burdensome symptoms, reduced quality of life, and low quality end-of-life care. Palliative care may improve such outcomes, yet resources are strained and it is difficult to identify which patients are most in need. The aims of this research are to provide new knowledge regarding the unmet palliative care needs of patients with COPD and to develop a novel and scalable method to identify patients with such needs in order to reduce patients' suffering and improve quality of life.",Identifying palliative care needs among hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,9746515,K23HL143181,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'American', 'Award', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Calibration', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Comorbidity', 'Consult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marital Status', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Social Work', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'functional status', 'hospital services', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'physical symptom', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'readmission rates', 'recruit', 'skills', 'study population', 'supportive environment', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2019,174140,0.030883702578896652
"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients. This mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research will develop and test methods to surmount these three barriers in the context of a multifaceted training program that will make the Principal Investigator a more effective mentor and team leader.",Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure,9739179,K24HL143289,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advance Directives', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'career', 'clinical infrastructure', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'financial incentive', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized approach', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'student mentoring', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K24,2019,119704,0.002037969108293079
"Data Driven Methods for Missing Data Imputation in Surgical Disparities Research Project Summary/Abstract Disparities in health and health care have been a longstanding challenge in the United States. One specific area of medical care in which racial/ethnic disparities have been identified is total joint arthroplasty (TJA), particularly total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA). Large, population based studies necessary to address healthcare disparities can be costly and difficult to perform, and may be compromised by sampling strategies and patient selection biases. Efficient alternatives are publicly-available nationally representative databases such as the HCUP State Inpatient Databases (SID) and National Inpatient Sample (NIS). The SID provide information on all patients admitted to hospitals within participating states, allowing for comparison of health care access among many vulnerable populations, across states, and over time. The NIS is the largest publicly-available all-payer inpatient health care database in the nation. It is sampled from the SID through a complex survey design, yielding national estimates of health care utilization, quality, and outcomes. A significant limitation of the NIS and the SID is the quantity of missing data. In particular, “patient race”, a key indicator for health disparities research, has a high proportion of missingness. Multiple imputation (MI) approaches have been increasingly popular for providing sound statistical methods to account for missing data. When conducting MI, it is suggested that imputation models be as general as data allow them to be, in order to accommodate a wide range of subsequent analyses of imputed data sets. This requires all relationships that are going to be investigated in any subsequent analysis, such as nonlinearities and interactions, to be included in the imputation model. Unfortunately, traditional MI methods, such as the multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE), are built on parametric imputation models. These models are often not flexible enough to capture interactions and nonlinearities in high dimensional and large scale data settings. Unlike parametric models, machine learning techniques (MLTs) are model-free methods, and thus provide flexibility for missing data imputation. MLTs use algorithms that automatically and iteratively learn from all data to detect statistical dependencies in observations without being explicitly programmed where to look. The goal of this study is to make the two HCUP databases a more useful resource for the study of surgical disparities and other areas of medicine. Accordingly, we propose novel MI methods based on MLTs to impute missing data in the SID and the NIS, and to use the imputed datasets to measure racial disparity in TKA. Project Narrative It would be challenging to approach the goal of eliminating healthcare disparities without identifying disparities and analyzing the underlying causes using nationally representative databases such as the HCUP SID and NIS. This proposal imputes missing data for surgical disparities research using the two databases.",Data Driven Methods for Missing Data Imputation in Surgical Disparities Research,9717557,R01MD013901,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Population Study', 'Race', 'Records', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'administrative database', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'health care availability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'high dimensionality', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial disparity', 'random forest', 'simulation', 'software development', 'sound', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'usability']",NIMHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,268034,-0.0009008693186648441
"Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist committed to improving the quality of patient-oriented research for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Worldwide, millions of patients develop ARF annually. In the U.S., nearly one million patients with ARF require mechanical ventilation annually, accounting for a quarter of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As improvements in ICU care reduce such patients’ in-hospital mortality rates, attention has shifted to the challenges ARF survivors face in regaining their prior cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning. However, there is a key barrier for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing new interventions to improve ARF survivorship – that is, the current lack of an endpoint that (1) captures long-term patient dispositions, (2) incorporates patient preferences and perspectives, and (3) is able to be analyzed without concern for statistical biases. The overarching goal of this research is to support clinical innovation by developing new approaches to measure and report long-term patient-centered outcomes that overcome the methodological barriers currently limiting ARF RCTs. The applicant will accomplish his goals under the mentorship of established researchers in critical care, patient-centered outcomes research, statistics, and informatics to assure his transition to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist. First, the applicant will use an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit and integrate ARF survivors’ and their caregivers’ perspectives into a new patient-centered, long-term composite outcome measure (K99 phase). During the R00 phase, the applicant will recruit ARF survivors to participate in a prospective cohort, and follow these patients to describe the burden of ARF survivorship over 1-year using the new endpoint developed during the K99 phase. This endeavor will also provide key data that will facilitate sample size calculations in future ARF RCTs. Data from this cohort will additionally be used to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm to predict risks for adverse long-term outcomes among ARF patients early in their ICU stays. Thus, this K99/R00 will augment ARF research by establishing a new outcome measure anchored in patient perspectives, improving the understanding and clinical prognostication of post-ICU morbidity following ARF, and facilitate the efficiency and clinical relevance of future ARF RCTs by enabling measurement of patients’ baseline risks for different outcomes. Concurrently, the didactic work, individual study, and hands-on learning in mixed-methods research, natural language processing, and predictive analytics will fill key training gaps for the applicant, thereby positioning him for a successful, independently-funded research career advancing the science of outcomes measurement and analysis for ARF RCTs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized trials testing strategies to improve long-term outcomes for survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) are hampered by the lack of valid, patient-centered endpoints. Using interviews with ARF survivors and their caregivers, statistical simulation, consensus building among stakeholders, and a prospective cohort study, the applicant will develop, describe the epidemiology of, and predict a new patient-oriented outcome that will support trials of innovative approaches to improve ARF survivorship outcomes.","Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure",9681489,K99HL141678,"['Accounting', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rogaine', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'hands-on learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'residence', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'survivorship', 'tenure track']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2019,108012,0.007854118981149301
"A Comprehensive Fall Prevention System for Memory Care: Final Feasibility and Randomized Controlled Study Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the activities of daily living. Fall safety systems show the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of showing caregivers how falls occur. Our goal is to extend the impacts of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with off-the- shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL, who can monitor several facilities at a time, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the facilities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection (as opposed to hours after, when the next scheduled visit to the room of the patient happens). Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) reviews the fall videos to make recommendations on how to re-organize the patient space (intervention), to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The present Fast Track NIH SBIR project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 11 memory care facilities, recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots, which we leverage:  · Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility  from the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led  to clinical benefits including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of an Occupational  Therapist (OT) to re-organize patient space. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11 facilities,  totaling 100 patients monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4 (ongoing): We demonstrated the ability to perform online (real-time) fall detection, with  real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions, which  provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities, and confirmed the decrease of the  number of falls, with the 100 patients. In this project, we will develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real- time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective.

"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories.

"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with multiple brain metastases, a cancer which has spread to multiple places in the brain, have poor survival or quality of life after single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy. We will develop and study a new treatment strategy for multiple brain metastases using spatial and temporal fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery by frameless GammaKnife.

"EPICA: Edge-based Precision Intensive Care Analytics Abstract Medical decision making in intensive care settings relies on complex biomedical information, collected in real time, to assist hospital staff in patient management and intervention decisions. In this context, machine learning (ML) applications applied to healthcare analytics have been shown to provide significant improvement in quality of care and overall efficiency in ICU operations. A number of challenges affect healthcare analytics, these are growing data sizes, increasingly heterogeneous data sources, data assurance, credibility and quality as well as the privacy of patient record interchange. Current approaches to healthcare analytics are predominantly reliant on desktop and cloud computing architectures. These traditional systems exhibit high-latency, high-power requirements, and are overall inefficient for advanced analytic applications. If we hope to leverage the benefits of growing data size and heterogeneity, a new hardware paradigm for real time, secure and reliable ML in the clinic is needed. A potential for great innovation in medical big data applications is to imbue more analytic capability into smaller devices that sit closer to the source of data. This so-called edge computing will be instrumental in future medical applications, where real-time, low-latency, low-power computational tools are likely to dramatically improve the feasibility of remote monitoring and intensive monitoring applications, ultimately improving health outcomes. Lucid Circuit, Inc. is developing a line of purpose-built edge-analytics processors called AstrumTM. AstrumTM is an energy-efficient runtime-adaptable processor for reliable high-performance computing and low-power applications. AstrumTM processors benefit from an adaptable compute fabric that combines runtime-reconfigurable architecture and in-silicon security features. AstrumTM processors are designed to supports evolving analytics algorithms. In this proposal, we seek to optimize state of the art ML algorithms for signal processing, data quality monitoring and safe data interchange in remote and intensive-monitoring medical applications at the edge using AstrumTM. In phase II, we seek to develop an analytics programming ecosystem within which developers can customize signal quality metrics and prediction rules at a high level of abstraction, using popular analytics programming platforms. Ultimately, the work proposed in this application will enable the development of a new generation of edge-based precision intensive care and mobile health devices, together with a programming toolkit for customization, tuning, and development of ML algorithms that best match the needs of researchers, patients, and healthcare providers. Project Narrative Machine Learning (ML) applications to medical big data, have been shown to provide improved quality of care in intensive care settings. Their implementation in the clinic is currently limited by reliance on obsolete desktop and cloud computing architectures. By leveraging our experience with purpose-built AstrumTM processors, we propose to adapt state of the art analytics for computation at the edge, aiming to deliver edge-based precision intensive care analytics capabilities to a new generation of intensive care and mobile health devices.",EPICA: Edge-based Precision Intensive Care Analytics,9778345,R43NR018623,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Cloud Computing', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Quality', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ecosystem', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitals', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'System', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'operation', 'patient privacy', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'signal processing', 'tool']",NINR,"LUCID CIRCUIT, INC.",R43,2019,149985,0.004411488548056078
"TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial Abstract Adverse outcomes, including death, respiratory failure and renal failure, are common after surgery, and represent a serious public health challenge. Such adverse outcomes can be mitigated through integrated, collaborative health information technology solutions that provide clinicians cognitive and computational support. The chief motivation for the TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial is that a multi-faceted telemedicine solution has the potential to facilitate the dynamic assessment of risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, and implement evidence-based practices. The net result for patients would be improved safety and outcomes. Our telemedicine solution, called the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), encompasses real-time patient data integration from the electronic health record, clinician decision support, machine learning algorithms that predict adverse outcomes, and remote monitoring for the operating room (OR). This conceptualization of sophisticated remote monitoring for the OR is somewhat analogous to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The innovative TECTONICS trial will build on a series of preliminary studies (funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Science Foundation) that have (i) established the usefulness and usability of a prototype telemedicine ACT; (ii) customized and enhanced decision-support alerts for the ACT, based on clinician user feedback; (iii) designed, developed, and tested machine learning algorithms that predict adverse postoperative outcomes; and (iv) established the feasibility of conducing a real-world randomized trial of the prototype ACT. The TECTONICS trial builds logically on these preliminary studies. Aim 1 is to show that we can implement and sustain an integrated ACT system. As part of this, we will iteratively assess the accuracy of our machine learning algorithms and modify them to improve their ability to predict in real time when patients are at high risk for experiencing negative outcomes. Aim 2 is to understand how the ACT system affects clinicians’ (anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists [CRNAs]) thinking, decision-making and behavior. This understanding will help us to enhance the ACT system, improve workflow processes in the ACT and in the OR, and improve collaborative interactions between anesthesiologists and CRNAs. Aim 3 is to conduct a rigorous clinical trial. We will evaluate the impact of the ACT system on the quality of care in the OR, and clinical outcomes such as intraoperative awareness, and postoperative delirium, renal failure, respiratory failure, and 30-day mortality. TECTONICS will be the first practical and scientifically rigorous trial of a telemedicine solution for the operating room, and will inform the usefulness of incorporating such technology in routine care of surgical patients, including under-resourced healthcare settings. With many millions undergoing surgery yearly, this feasible application of technology could signal a major shift in the safety and quality of perioperative care, and translate into substantial societal gain. Narrative Adverse outcomes, including death, are common after surgery and represent a public health challenge. There is an urgent need to assess the potential usefulness of a remote technology-based control center for the operating room to dynamically assess risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, implement evidence-based practices, and improve outcomes. This innovative study will rigorously assess whether the implementation of an 'anesthesiology control tower', with sophisticated decision-support tools, improves the care, safety and outcomes of surgical patients.","TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial",9738886,R01NR017916,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Certified registered nurse anesthetist', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Delirium', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enabling Factors', 'Engineering', 'Evidence based practice', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Network-based', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative Care', 'Perioperative complication', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Update', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'postoperative delirium', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'routine care', 'support tools', 'surgery outcome', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'waiver']",NINR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,640937,-0.009034916131182128
"Analytics-Based Platform for Diabetic Retinopathy Care Management ABSTRACT Despite the over 90% efficacy of diabetic retinopathy (DR) treatment, it continues to be the leading cause of blindness in working age Americans. Over 30 million adults in the US have diabetes. Of these, 28% will develop DR and 4.4% will develop vision-threatening DR (VTDR). Currently, less than half of all patients with diabetes receive the recommended annual dilated eye exam and, of those diagnosed with VTDR, only 30% undergo timely treatment. New screening protocols are increasing screening effectiveness, however, even if every patient is screened, the majority of those at increased risk do not receive evidence-based follow-up care; a classic public health failure common to population-based screening. With expertise in health systems engineering and ophthalmology, the research team is uniquely suited to eliminate the root causes of this failure; resulting in a new, comprehensive care model designed to prevent blindness for the 8.9 million Americans with DR. Retinal Care Inc. (RCI)’s focus is on eliminating blindness by applying targeted care coordination for patients at increased risk for VTDR; ensuring they progress through the care path to treatment. However, two significant deficiencies weaken RCI’s ability to deliver effective care coordination. The first is insufficient capacity due to coordinating care for 35% of all patients, though less than 5% actually have VTDR. This derives from the low positive predictive value of the current system, based on a handheld electroretinography and pupillography device deployed in a primary care setting. The first aim is to improve the ability to classify a patient as low- risk for VTDR, thereby reducing the care coordination burden and improving quality and effectiveness. Aim 1: Improve the ability to accurately identify patients at increased risk for VTDR by including patient  health and demographic attributes in a machine learning based predictive algorithm for VTDR diagnosis.  Patient clusters will be identified (a) and used to create sub-population specific risk models (b). The second deficiency is the lack of adherence to follow-up and treatment after identification as increased risk for VTDR. Once a patient is identified as increased risk, the care coordination of the RCI DR program has averaged over five phone calls per patient to achieve follow-up with an eye care provider. The second aim is to identify and eliminate these barriers to coordinated care between patient and provider. Aim 2 Apply text analytics and simulation to improve access, compliance, cost, and equity by enhancing care coordination, from diagnosis to treatment, for patients at increased risk for VTDR. The application of data analytics and systems engineering methods to integrate and improve each critical component of the care path, access to care, accuracy of diagnosis, and adherence to follow-up and treatment, will enable a paradigm shift in DR treatment. RCI’s platform is designed to eliminate deficiencies of the current care delivery model by delivering a first-of-its-kind, end-to-end solution for diabetic retinopathy care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetic retinopathy (DR), affecting 8.9 million Americans, is the leading cause of blindness in working age Americans, yet, blindness is preventable in 90% of the cases with timely detection and treatment. To reach the 30 million adults living with diabetes in the US, the Retinal Care DR platform is designed to eliminate deficiencies of the current care delivery model via a first-of- its-kind end-to-end solution for DR care implementable in any care setting. This will be accomplished via the application of data analytics (machine learning and statistical analysis) and systems engineering (sentiment analysis and simulation) methods to integrate and improve each of the three critical components of the care path: access to care, accuracy of diagnosis, and adherence to follow-up and treatment.",Analytics-Based Platform for Diabetic Retinopathy Care Management,9679729,R41EY029917,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'American', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroretinography', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Improve Access', 'Information Systems', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Rights', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Service delivery model', 'Severities', 'Social Workers', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical method', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'care coordination', 'care costs', 'care providers', 'classification trees', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'decision tree learning', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'model design', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'pupillography', 'response', 'screening', 'simulation', 'sociodemographics']",NEI,"RETINAL CARE, INC.",R41,2019,219356,0.029904240903743412
"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits.

"Technology-supported training and quality assurance for psychosocial interventions Millions of Americans receive psychosocial interventions such as psychotherapy each year for treatment of mental health, behavioral health, and addiction problems. Evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are increasingly emphasized in professional practice guidelines, taught in training programs, sought out by consumers, and valued by payers. Yet, at present, there is no scalable method for evaluating the quality of psychotherapy services. In research settings, human-based behavioral coding methods are used, but these are time consuming, costly, and rarely used in real-world clinical settings.  Psychotherapy is a “talk based” treatment, and as such, the active ingredients and quality of the therapy are found in the spoken language and interaction of clinician and client. The current proposal will develop a software system (CORE-CBT) that will automatically generate a summary report of quality metrics for CBT, from an audio recording of a CBT session, using speech signal processing and machine learning. Importantly, the current work builds from previous, successful work in developing CORE-MI, an automated system for evaluating motivational interviewing for addiction. The existing CORE-MI tool and the expertise gained through its development will serve as the foundation for the current proposal.  Our technical team is complemented by clinical and implementation expertise via the partnership of the Beck Community Initiative (BCI) with Philadelphia’s DBHIDS. Since 2007, BCI has partnered in training staff at 60 programs in the DBHIDS network to deliver high-quality CBT, including objective quality ratings via the Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale (CTRS). Through ongoing training efforts, the BCI has generated an archive of over 6,500 recorded CBT sessions, of which more than 2,300 have been CTRS-coded for quality. This session archive and ongoing real-world trainings in the DBHIDS network provide the perfect context to develop CORE-CBT, a tool that automates quality coding for CBT.  Aim 1: ​Extend and evaluate machine learning algorithms to automatically code CBT competence, using an archive of more than 2,000 CBT fidelity-coded sessions. ​Aim 2: ​Adapt and enhance front-end user interface and session reports with key stakeholders (frontline clinicians, supervisors, and clinic administrators), evaluating acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility. ​Aim 3: ​Evaluate CORE-CBT technology during CBT training in 4 BCI partner clinics in the DBHIDS network, with approximately 48-64 frontline clinicians and 4,000 sessions, assessing both implementation outcomes (adoption, sustainment) and service outcomes (increased capacity, efficiency, and effectiveness of training). ​Aim 4:​ Evaluate the appropriateness of CORE-CBT and its metrics for quality assurance (clinics) and value-based reimbursement (payers), using an in-person participatory design workshop. An advisory board of behavioral health payers will provide feedback over the course of the study to maximize generalizability and future uptake in large healthcare systems.

"Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP) 1. Abstract We propose to create a NIMH P50 ALACRITY Center that develops the collaborations, data systems, and methods necessary to form a state-wide Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research, aka the LEAP Center. While recent trial evidence suggests great promise for coordinated specialty care (CSC) for patients with first episode psychosis (FEP), there remain several gaps in the knowledge base for the care of psychosis in general. Now is an ideal time to address these gaps because of recent policy changes enhancing FEP care financing, practice changes in the field, and methods developed outside of mental health. To create this Center, we will start with interdisciplinary collaborations between CSC clinics in Massachusetts, policy makers/regulators, and stakeholders, and include FEP experts from across the country plus scientific experts from outside of mental health, e.g., in data science, machine learning, epidemiology, and health policy. We also will leverage recent Massachusetts efforts to mandate, standardized, and support data collection on FEP care structures, delivery, and outcomes from all FEP clinics within the state. We also will apply and develop modern methods for clinical prediction and comparative effectiveness research (CER), e.g., machine learning and g-methods, for FEP research. Accordingly, we have three overall Center aims: 1) Collaborations; 2) Data systems; and 3) Prediction and CER methods. The Center will start with three foundational and complementary projects: 1) Using the state All Payer Claims Database (APCD), Project 1 will apply a population-level approach to examine which patients receive care in FEP clinics offering CSC versus elsewhere, as the number of clinics increases, then estimate the treatment effect on unfavorable clinical event rates such as hospitalizations; 2) Project 2 will review the data collected by the state from all of the FEP clinics, assess and improve data collection quality, validate measures, and integrate perspectives; and 3) Project 3 will define clusters of patients using longitudinal outcome data (i.e., begin to unpack the amount of clinical heterogeneity), predict the cluster type for individual patients, and examine the impact of CSC treatment accounting for this clinical heterogeneity. The Administrative Core and Methods Core (Prediction and CER) bind these projects together. The Center will include a group of Scientific Advisors from across North America, Center Faculty from diverse scientific disciplines, including those that historically have had little exposure in mental health research, and Stakeholders, including policy makers, organizational decision makers, and patient and family advocates. All three groups will be deeply involved in the Center from design to dissemination. The overall goal is to create a state-wide learning health system for early psychosis. This effort to create the protocols and apply the methods necessary to convert large amounts of data into useful clinical and policy knowledge will inform other national efforts, e.g., NIMH’s EPINET.

"Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP) 1. Abstract We propose to create a NIMH P50 ALACRITY Center that develops the collaborations, data systems, and methods necessary to form a state-wide Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research, aka the LEAP Center. While recent trial evidence suggests great promise for coordinated specialty care (CSC) for patients with first episode psychosis (FEP), there remain several gaps in the knowledge base for the care of psychosis in general. Now is an ideal time to address these gaps because of recent policy changes enhancing FEP care financing, practice changes in the field, and methods developed outside of mental health. To create this Center, we will start with interdisciplinary collaborations between CSC clinics in Massachusetts, policy makers/regulators, and stakeholders, and include FEP experts from across the country plus scientific experts from outside of mental health, e.g., in data science, machine learning, epidemiology, and health policy. We also will leverage recent Massachusetts efforts to mandate, standardized, and support data collection on FEP care structures, delivery, and outcomes from all FEP clinics within the state. We also will apply and develop modern methods for clinical prediction and comparative effectiveness research (CER), e.g., machine learning and g-methods, for FEP research. Accordingly, we have three overall Center aims: 1) Collaborations; 2) Data systems; and 3) Prediction and CER methods. The Center will start with three foundational and complementary projects: 1) Using the state All Payer Claims Database (APCD), Project 1 will apply a population-level approach to examine which patients receive care in FEP clinics offering CSC versus elsewhere, as the number of clinics increases, then estimate the treatment effect on unfavorable clinical event rates such as hospitalizations; 2) Project 2 will review the data collected by the state from all of the FEP clinics, assess and improve data collection quality, validate measures, and integrate perspectives; and 3) Project 3 will define clusters of patients using longitudinal outcome data (i.e., begin to unpack the amount of clinical heterogeneity), predict the cluster type for individual patients, and examine the impact of CSC treatment accounting for this clinical heterogeneity. The Administrative Core and Methods Core (Prediction and CER) bind these projects together. The Center will include a group of Scientific Advisors from across North America, Center Faculty from diverse scientific disciplines, including those that historically have had little exposure in mental health research, and Stakeholders, including policy makers, organizational decision makers, and patient and family advocates. All three groups will be deeply involved in the Center from design to dissemination. The overall goal is to create a state-wide learning health system for early psychosis. This effort to create the protocols and apply the methods necessary to convert large amounts of data into useful clinical and policy knowledge will inform other national efforts, e.g., NIMH’s EPINET.

"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,9724645,R21EB027852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Car Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Equilibrium', 'Fall prevention', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Social Psychology', 'Statistical Models', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive load', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'standard measure', 'treadmill', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2019,190538,-0.007833395971953282
"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,9646811,K01AG061274,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data Set', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Rate', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Internal Medicine', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Price', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Savings', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'asthmatic patient', 'career', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'financial incentive', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'health economics', 'health plan', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'skills', 'statistics', 'treatment effect']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,K01,2019,130618,0.007085368636814814
"Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management Abstract  The study will develop more accurate, computational predictive models and a novel automatic explanation function to better identify patients likely to benefit most from care management. For many chronic diseases, a small portion of patients with high vulnerabilities, severe disease, or great barriers to care consume most healthcare resources and costs. To improve outcomes and resource use, many healthcare systems use predictive models to prospectively identify high-risk patients and enroll them in care management to implement tailored care plans. For maximal benefit from costly care management with limited service capacity, only patients at the highest risk should be enrolled. But, current patient identification approaches have two limitations: 1) Low prediction accuracy causes misclassification, wasted costs, and suboptimal care. If an existing model  were used for care management allocation, enrollment would miss >50% of those who would benefit most  but include others unlikely to benefit. A healthcare system often has insufficient data for model training and  incomplete data on many patients. A typical model uses only a few risk factors for adverse outcomes, despite  many being known. Also, many predictive variables on patient and system characteristics are not found yet. 2) No explanation of the reasons for a prediction causes poor adoption of the prediction and busy care  managers to spend extra time and miss suitable interventions. Care managers need to understand why a  patient is predicted to be at high risk before allocating to care management and forming a tailored care plan.  Existing models rarely give such explanation, forcing care managers to do detailed patient chart reviews.  To address the limitations and optimize care management for more high-risk patients to receive appropriate care, the study will: a) improve accuracy of computationally identifying high-risk patients and assess potential impact on outcomes; b) automate explanation of computational prediction results and assess impact on model accuracy and outcomes; c) assess automatic explanations' impact on care managers' acceptance of the predictions and perceived care plan quality. The use case will be asthma that affects 9% of Americans and incurs 439,000 hospitalizations, 1.8 million emergency room visits, and $56 billion in cost annually. Asthma experts and computer scientists will use data from three leading healthcare systems; a novel, model-based transfer learning technique needing no other system's raw data; a novel, pattern-based automatic explanation technique that also improves model generalizability and accuracy; a new data source PreManage to make patient data more complete; and novel features on patient and system characteristics. These techniques can advance clinical machine learning for various applications, improve patient identification, and help form tailored care plans. Focus groups will be conducted with clinicians to explore generalizing the techniques to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and heart diseases, on whom care management is also needed. The results will potentially transform care management for better outcomes and more efficient resource use. Narrative  Care management is widely used in managing asthma patients. The proposed new techniques will boost the performance of patient identification and care plan development for care management, leading to improved clinical outcomes and more efficient healthcare resource use.",Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management,9750788,R01HL142503,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Air', 'American', 'Asthma', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drops', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weather', 'adverse outcome', 'asthmatic patient', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'care costs', 'computer science', 'cost', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'simulation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,807787,0.024341287913115656
"Using the Electronic Health Record to Identify and Promote Goals-of-Care Communication for Older Patients with Serious Illness Although discussions that address patients' goals of care are one of the most important aspects of palliative care, this communication is often lacking in our healthcare system. Goals-of-care communication is associated with improved patient and family outcomes and reduced intensity of care at the end of life. Electronic health records (EHR) provide a key opportunity to identify patients who would benefit from these discussions and to promote these discussions, yet prior interventions have not used the EHR for this purpose.  Older adults with chronic illness, and particularly those with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), are especially vulnerable to inappropriately intensive end-of-life care. To address this shortcoming, we build on two of our most successful programs, one using the EHR to identify goals-of-care discussions and the other a novel intervention called Jumpstart that promotes and enhances these discussions. We will examine the effectiveness of the Jumpstart intervention for hospitalized older adults with chronic illness and specifically oversample those with ADRD to understand the effectiveness of the intervention in this key group.  We propose 2 linked, complementary randomized trials. Trial 1, a pragmatic trial, compares usual care with a clinician-facing Jumpstart for hospitalized older adults with serious illness (n=2000). Trial 2, a comparative effectiveness trial, compares this clinician-facing Jumpstart with a bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart based on surveys completed by patients or family members (n=400). We hypothesize that the clinician-facing Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to usual care, and the bi-directional, patient- specific Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart. We use an innovative hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach to accomplish 3 aims. Aim 1 evaluates the effectiveness of the clinician-facing Jumpstart, compared with usual care, for improving quality of care; the primary outcome is EHR documentation of a goals-of-care discussion during the hospitalization. Secondary outcomes include intensity of care at the end of life. Aim 2 evaluates the effectiveness of the bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart; the primary outcome is the same as Trial 1. We will examine the same secondary outcomes, but also include patient- and family-reported outcomes assessed by surveys at 1 and 3 months after randomization including occurrence and quality of goals-of-care communication in the hospital, goal-concordant care, psychological symptoms, quality of life, and palliative care needs. We will also examine costs of care after accounting for costs of the interventions. In Aim 3, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation to explore barriers and facilitators to future implementation and dissemination.  Our team has experience conducting innovative multi-center trials with patient-centered outcomes, economic analyses, and implementation science. This novel hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach addresses key knowledge gaps to improve the quality and value of care for older adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Communication about goals of care is one of the most important aspects of palliative care for older adults, yet the lack of this communication is a major shortcoming in our healthcare system. We propose 2 linked and innovative randomized trials to evaluate a novel intervention that promotes and enhances goals-of-care discussions for hospitalized patients with serious chronic illness.

"Ethical, Legal and Social Implications in the Use of Digital Technology for Mental Health Applications Digital mental health technology (DMHT) –digital devices (smartphones, sensors) that can monitor and collect personal data from patients (tracking location/voice/motion, self-report), apply algorithms and machine learning (“ML”) to generate and integrate health and risk information (from genomics/family history), and even mediate care (monitoring treatment adherence or chatbot therapy)– is being integrated into mental health clinical care, with the goal of improving access, diagnostics and treatment for mental illness.

"NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health SUMMARY/ABSTRACT NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health – Overall Health outcomes are affected by myriad mechanisms, including behaviors. An important question is how such behaviors might be influenced in ways that improve health outcomes on a broad population-wide scale. The NBER Roybal Center explores this question by conducting carefully-designed experimental interventions with analytic and theoretical foundations in the behavioral sciences. The interventions are selected to be cost- effective and scalable. Among the categories of health-related behavior we plan to study are interventions to improve nutrition; interventions to increase exercise; interventions to overcome addiction, including tobacco, alcohol, and opioids; interventions to promote preventive care, including vaccinations and incremental utilization of workplace wellness programs; interventions to improve medical adherence, including the filling of pharmaceutical prescriptions; and interventions to improve the decisions of health care providers, including applications of machine learning. The research plan is strengthened by a partnership with Geisinger Clinic, a non-profit health care network and insurer with a rich history of innovative delivery reforms and experimental research to improve population health in an active, well-integrated, health care delivery and community health setting. The NBER-Geisinger partnership provides a core infrastructure for implementing experimental interventions on-site with an engaged and committed health care delivery partner. The Center also engages a collaborative network of leading behavioral scientists from multiple disciplines who conduct the experimental interventions, share research activities and findings, collaborate on joint projects, and brainstorm new intervention opportunities, building from findings in basic science. This application renews the NBER Roybal Center for the next five years. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Health is a foundational source of wellbeing for people of all ages. As resilient as human physiology may be, and as random and unexpected as health events may be to any particular person at any particular time, health is also affected by the lifestyle decisions that we make, our behavioral interactions with the medical care system, and how we respond to adverse health events when they occur.

"Personalized multimedication packaging with integrated real-time instrumentation to improve adherence Abstract Approximately 23% of Americans take 3 or more prescription medications, often as a part of complex drug regimens that challenge adherence, contributing to treatment failures and costing US healthcare $100 billion or more, annually. Difficulties managing polypharmacy negatively impact all stakeholders – patients, doctors, pharmacies and insurers. The problem is particularly significant in elder-care, as the likelihood of developing chronic conditions treatable by medication increases and multiple characteristics of this population pose assorted risks for medication errors. Custom multimedication packaging has shown promise in addressing some of the drivers of non-adherence, but offers no solution for other drivers such as errors in drug reconciliation, healthcare practitioner involvement, care coordination and patient education. The multiple stakeholders in medication prescribing and utilization practices constitute a variety of potential sources of medication management problems, but also a diverse set of clients for polypharmacy solutions. Insightfil is developing a comprehensive medication management solution that incorporates convenience packaging with passive detection of medication adherence to provide essential and medicine-related information in real-time generating a channel for more accurate information exchange between all stakeholders for improved patient care and satisfaction. In previous work, we designed, built and tested a robotic workstation that offers innovative patient drug packaging, which is unique in its ability to avoid medication cross-contamination. Leveraging our successful launch of the medication dispensing robot, the goal of this Phase I SBIR is to develop instrument pill pouches and use the resulting real- time adherence data to improve the way patients are nudged into increased adherence through more personalized and context-specific communications. Toward this end we propose Specific Aims to develop three components of the technology: 1) a near-field communication (NFC) sensor that is compatible with the emerging industry standard for custom fill convenience packaging; 2) a smartphone app that reads the NFC tags to verify that a medication pack has been opened; and 3) a smartphone app to deliver real-time, context sensitive patient messaging based on medication use patterns. Once the prototype system is developed, we will conduct a pilot study (Specific Aim 4) of 30 multimedication users to provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy and acceptability of Insightfil's platform technology. After establishing proof-of-concept through the completion of the SBIR Phase I project, we will refine the resulting prototype technology into a more robust commercial grade system with an expanded-features patient app ready for pilot deployment in 1-2 pharmacies serving 5,000 patients (Phase II). Significantly, the research design required for commercialization will not require FDA approval for deployment in pharmacies - Pharmacists will follow all regulations applicable to the dispensing of medications.

"Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases PROJECT SUMMARY The over-arching aim of this research is to: improve understanding of the patterns of health care utilization and associated costs of physical elder abuse victims to improve early identification and intervention and to inform policy. In our prior research, supported by an NIA GEMSSTAR and Beeson grant to PI Dr. Rosen, we leveraged unique partnerships with prosecutors’ offices to comprehensively examine legal case files from more than 200 victims in two large metropolitan areas, representing the largest retrospective series of legally adjudicated physical elder abuse cases ever examined. For the proposed study, we plan to link these cases, for which we have done extensive clinical analysis, to Medicare claims data. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) To use Medicare claims to describe rates and patterns of health care utilization of victims before and after detection, with a focus on potentially missed opportunities by health professionals to identify abuse and differences based on victim characteristics, (2) To compare rates and patterns of ED visits and hospitalizations of physical elder abuse victims to control groups selected algorithmically from Medicare claims data, and (3) To compare patterns of health care utilization other than EDs/hospitals between victims and controls. The proposed research will provide important insight into the patterns of health care utilization for physical elder abuse victims, focusing on whether missed opportunities exist and suggestive patterns emerge. We plan to employ sophisticated machine learning approaches to increase our ability to identify patterns suggestive of physical elder abuse exposure. This will inform strategies for identification and intervention by health care providers, and knowledge gleaned will support the future development of a health informatics tool to identify potential victims. Findings on associated costs will help define the scope and impact of physical elder abuse. This innovative approach leverages existing data gathered with NIA support and extrapolates from successful research approaches in child abuse and intimate partner violence while expanding on them. As no additional subjects will be prospectively enrolled as part of this research, we avoid many of the ethical concerns typical in elder mistreatment work. Our multi-disciplinary team of experts in elder abuse, child abuse and neglect, intimate partner violence, and emergency medicine as well as specialists in statistics, health economics, and computer science is uniquely able to conduct this research. Previously, we have done seminal work examining health care usage and health-related outcomes of elder abuse victims by linking adult protective services and police databases to health care data, which is highly relevant for this proposal. We also have deep experience in using Medicare claims data and machine learning for research. The long-term goal of our research is to leverage a better understanding of health care use by elder abuse victims to improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to help this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Elder abuse can have serious health consequences, but little is known about the patterns of their health care utilization. We propose to comprehensively examine the health care utilization and associated costs from known physical elder abuse cases using Medicare claims data. Findings from this research will improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to reduce costs and help this vulnerable population.",Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases,9776419,R01AG060086,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Case Series', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Elder Abuse', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Departments', 'Hospitalization', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methodology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Victimization', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abuse victim', 'adjudicate', 'aged', 'base', 'computer science', 'convict', 'cost', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'health economics', 'hospital utilization', 'improved', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intimate partner violence', 'legal cases', 'maxillofacial', 'medication compliance', 'member', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'perpetrators', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'statistics']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,474195,0.017856949397241712
"Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness PROJECT SUMMARY Access to mental health specialists is difficult for many patients in the U.S., particularly for the poor and those who live in rural communities. Telemental health is one potential solution for this access problem, and there has been rapid growth in the number of live video-based telemental health visits in the U.S. While there are numerous rigorous randomized-control trials comparing telemental health visits to in-person mental health specialist care, there have been little research on how telemental health is being used in real-world settings. The uptake of telemental health has been very uneven geographically, and what explains this variation is also largely unknown. Our mixed-methods proposal centers on filling these gaps in knowledge. Under the first aim, we will conduct a series of descriptive analyses of data on 75 million adults with Medicare or commercial insurance to understand how telemental health is being used in conjunction with in-person care and whether the growth of telemental health has decreased disparities in the use of mental health specialists among disadvantaged populations. Under the second aim, we seek to explain why there is geographic variation in uptake using robust statistical machine learning. Under the third aim, we exploit the variation in uptake to assess whether communities with greater telemental health penetration have experienced improvements in care for patients with mental illness. In the fourth aim we will conduct qualitative interviews with providers to complement the empirical analyses and understand the key contextual factors underlying our findings. Understanding how telemental health is being used, why there is variation in use of telemental health, and whether telemental health use is associated with higher quality care could help drive future telemental health interventions and influence the ongoing policy debate on telemedicine regulations and reimbursement. Together the results of these aims are consistent with the NIMH's expressed interest in innovative delivery models that can improve care for underserved communities. It is difficult for many patients with mental illness to access care from a mental health specialist. Telemental health is one way to potentially help these patients receive care and the number of such visits for mental illness has increased rapidly. In this project, we will study how telemental health is being used to care for patients with mental illness, what drives variation in use, and whether telemedicine is associated with receipt of higher quality care.",Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness,9600712,R01MH112829,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diffusion', 'Disabled Persons', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Telemedicine', 'Telemental', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care costs', 'contextual factors', 'control trial', 'demographics', 'design', 'disadvantaged population', 'experience', 'geographic difference', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'older patient', 'population health', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'rapid growth', 'rural area', 'severe mental illness', 'symposium', 'trend', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2019,734746,0.023547067012283932
"Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population world-wide. Although diabetic retinopathy has been well-studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME.  Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the VA uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME.  This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large.  The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center. Despite the significant visual loss associated with diabetic macular edema, little is known about the frequency of its occurrence, its risk factors, and the real-world effectiveness of existing treatments. The purpose of this proposed research is to utilize the VA National Patient Care Database to extract relevant data elements to examine these three clinical questions: 1) what is the incidence and prevalence of diabetic macular edema, 2) what are the risk factors associated with its development, and 3) what is the comparative real-world effectiveness of its treatments, including intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, intravitreal corticosteroid therapy and macular laser. The methods developed in this research proposal will not only further our understanding of DME but also generalize and enable future large-scale ophthalmic studies.",Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema,9756410,K23EY029246,"['Adopted', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Blindness', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundational Skills', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Centers', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Light Coagulation', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Smoking Status', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Veterans', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Washington', 'bevacizumab', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'diabetes management', 'diabetic', 'epidemiology study', 'hands-on learning', 'health administration', 'intravitreal injection', 'kidney dysfunction', 'laser photocoagulation', 'macula', 'macular edema', 'mortality', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'screening', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapy outcome', 'traditional therapy', 'treatment optimization']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2019,233078,-0.01414575360526399
"Developing an integrated virtual assistant (IVA): A tailored behavior tracking and reminder solution to assist persons with dementia and their caregivers Project Summary/Abstract Recent attempts to estimate early stage prevalence of early stage dementia in the United States suggest that as much as 19% of the population over the age of 65 may be living with early stage disease. In early stage, function loss, particularly in the memory domain, significantly impacts instrumental activities of living (IADL) such as responsibility for own medications and scheduling. Solutions are needed that can adapt to the person with dementia and their caregiver through disease progression, tailor the level of support offered based on the changing needs of the dyad, and facilitate more time spent safely aging in place. In this project, an integrated virtual assistant (IVA) will serve as the interface between persons with dementia (PWD), their caregivers, and a suite of smart home technologies to provide aging-in-place support. Our long-term goal is to develop and commercialize IVA, a behavior tracking and reminder solution that will integrate smart home sensors, voice activation, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) into an easy-to-use application that provides tailored assistance to PWD and their caregivers as a dyad. The broader impact of these technologies is more time spent safely aging in place, better informed caregivers, and a reduction in caregiver burden and strain.

"MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS Co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (COD) are common in the United States and providers have been challenged to provide effective treatments. As a consequence, their clients with COD may experience poor treatment engagement, symptom exacerbation and cycle in and out of emergency services. This is particularly true for underrepresented populations with a COD including individuals whom are homeless and involved in the criminally justice system. Research shows that integrated and coordinated community- based services for COD can improve client outcomes. However, healthcare workforce has a gap in training staff on such treatment techniques, which we aim to close via this Phase II STTR project.  Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach and Networking (MISSION) is a unique evidence-based, trans-disciplinary treatment designed to address the complex needs of individuals with CODs and includes manuals for high risk populations of civilian and veteran homeless individuals as well as those involved in the criminally justice system. Listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration-Registry for Evidence Based Practices (NREPP), MISSION has had substantial impact. The Veterans Health Administration has deployed it in their national plan to end Veteran Homelessness. Massachusetts has used it in its Statewide Plan to End Homelessness and written it into Public Law for delivery alongside Veterans Treatment courts. While MISSION is a manualized treatment, a recent multisite implementation study identified the need for more comprehensive training tools. With NIAAA support, the University of Massachusetts Medical School (MISSION developers) partnered with Praxis on a Phase I STTR to (1) develop the MISSION University online training platform, (2) show proof of concept by implementing two training modules and an e-simulation case study, and (3) conduct a pilot randomized trial which demonstrated that training-as-usual Distance Learning (DL) + Technical Assistance (TA) outperformed TA alone.  In Phase II, we will complete MISSION U by developing and testing five new MISSION modules and companion e-simulations tools that test knowledge acquisition and application. We will first do a formative evaluation with 20 learners who will provide feedback on MISSION U modules. This will be followed by a randomized controlled trial similar to Phase I in which 60 learners will be randomized to the DL or the DL+TA conditions. In preparation for future scalability, we will uniquely conduct a qualitative process evaluation using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance framework with 42 MISSION U participants to look at facilitators and barriers to implementation. Lastly, we will pilot test machine learning techniques with our 60 individuals who participated in the randomized trial in an effort to help personalize the MISSION U training experience for commercialization. !1 “MISSION U: A Multimedia Training Tool for Treatment of Individuals with Co-occurring Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders” is aimed at training providers of services for these individuals. MISSION U challenges prevailing provider training methodology that relies mainly on on-site provider training and/or online training using typical classroom-type materials. This project not only addresses the growing need for new provider training methodologies, but also offers the promise of improving clinical efficacy and reducing training costs and medical expenditures overall.! !",MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS,9774983,R42AA026751,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Assertiveness', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Community Outreach', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distance Learning', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency medical service', 'England', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based program', 'Expenditure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laws', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Multimedia', 'National Health Services', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pre-Post Tests', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Services', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Videoconferences', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'clinical efficacy', 'commercialization', 'community based service', 'computer science', 'cost', 'court', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'field study', 'formative assessment', 'health administration', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'outreach', 'peer', 'peer support', 'phase I trial', 'programs', 'prototype', 'provider networks', 'randomized trial', 'satisfaction', 'service providers', 'simulation', 'skills', 'sobriety', 'suicidal risk', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability']",NIAAA,"PRAXIS, INC.",R42,2019,751223,-0.03814661971223507
"SPEEKO for Elderspeak: A Self-Monitoring App to Improve Communication and Reduce Behavioral Symptoms in Care for Persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias PROJECT ABSTRACT  The growing population of persons with dementia presents challenges to providing high quality nursing home (NH) care. Care is complicated by behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as persons with dementia lose cognitive and communication abilities and cannot verbally express unmet physical and psychosocial needs. NH staff use “elderspeak,” speech similar to baby talk that is demeaning to residents. Residents react to elderspeak with BPSD resulting in increased use of psychotropic medication to control BPSD, higher staffing needs, more staff stress and turnover, and increased costs. The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff about elderspeak and better communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and BPSD in NH residents. To increase dissemination, this effective classroom-based training has been transformed to online internet modules that improve access for busy staff including those in rural and small NHs and increase ease of dissemination across long term care service settings. To further enhance training effects, SPEEKO for Elderspeak, an automated performance-based app that uses natural language processing has been developed to provide immediate reinforcement of training to staff at the point-of care. This study will build on app proof of concept to establish feasibility of use in the clinical setting and will test preliminary efficacy of the app for augmenting the effect of training on reducing elderspeak communication in dementia care.  This R21 will conduct a clinical trial in response to PAR-18-179; Research on Informal and Formal Caregiving for Alzheimer’s Disease by testing a technology-based, natural language processing app to support caregivers in addressing unique challenges of providing advanced dementia care. We will demonstrate feasibility of use at the point-of-care with five certified nursing assistants, and further validate the app’s accuracy by comparing app outputs reporting diminutive use to results from transcription and psycholinguistic coding. Hypothesized app effects on augmenting reductions in staff elderspeak diminutive use after training will be tested in a cluster randomized trial comparing immediate and delayed feedback with 60 CNAs in 6 nursing homes. If effective in boosting training effects, this readily scalable app can be disseminated across long term care service and support settings to increase communication training effects that will reduce resident BPSD and psychotropic medication use and provide periodic reinforcement for communication training.  The goal is to further improve and sustain effects of communication training in nursing staff that will reduce BPSD and inappropriate use of psychoactive medications. This nonpharmacological approach uses available technology to improve dementia care and aligns with the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care. As the number of persons diagnosed with dementia triples in the next 30 years, empowering care providers to provide high quality care for individuals with dementia is of critical importance. PROJECT NARRATIVE This R21 will test an automated natural language processing feedback app that has the potential to improve and sustain effects of communication training for nursing home staff and subsequently to reduce Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia and resulting inappropriate use of psychoactive medications in nursing home residents with dementia. This nonpharmacological approach uses available technology to improve dementia care and aligns with the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care.

"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,9567908,P01AG005842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health trends', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Income', 'India', 'Information Technology', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Obesity', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Social Values', 'Suicide', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'care outcomes', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service organization', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'opioid use', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2019,1747167,0.02605239415365435
"Developing Evidence- based User Centered Design and Implementation Guidelines to Improve Health Information Technology Usability ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to provide an evidence-base to better inform user centered design and implementation processes to improve health information technology (health IT) usability and safety. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-15-005). Utilizing a hybrid approach of expert manual review and machine learning techniques, specifically natural language processing, we will develop methods to rapidly analyze patient safety event data to determine which events are health IT related. We will then further categorize the health IT related safety events to determine which events could have been prevented by effective usability or implementation processes. Through this analysis we will be able to specify the usability and implementation processes that are critical to the safe and effective use of health IT. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health IT, and computer science. The proposed research is based on unique insights that our team gleaned from previous research that we conducted focusing on health IT vendor design and implementation processes. The application addresses fundamental aspects of the call for applications by providing an evidence base to improve health IT usability and safety to better inform policy and practice. This research effort is being conducted in partnership with a health IT vendor and a patient safety organization to ensure that our results align with vendor needs and to ensure the results are generalizable. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the critical user centered design and implementation processes to inform vendor and provider practice. Our research will also provide organizations like the Office of the National Coordinator with the information to better inform health IT policy.

"Expert Guiding Technology to Help Individuals with Developmental Challenges Build Life and Vocational Skills Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) remains the most effective and scientifically-validated approach to remediate the deficits due to Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and intellectual disabilities (ID). There are serious challenges in delivering effective ABA: unavailability of effective treatment in many places; high instructor turnover; loss of program fidelity due to complexity and instructor variability; onerous data collection that directs attention away from the learner; and the time sink of creating required reports and charts that steals time away from instructional activities. A software platform named GAINS (Guidance, Assessment and Information System) is being developed that uniquely incorporates artificial intelligence to overcome problems in delivering ABA. GAINS is powered by expert guiding software that incorporates knowledge of ABA practice and curricula personalized for the individual with developmental challenges. Like Google Maps that guides you step-by-step and updates as you go along, GAINS guides instructors and caregivers and adapts to client responses on the fly. In this way, expert guiding technology reduces a priori training requirements in ABA while providing real- time apprenticeship coaching to overcome variability in instructor experience and improve program fidelity. Improved program fidelity promotes better learning outcomes of individuals with ASD and ID. The project will evaluate and iteratively innovate expert guiding technology to support the powerful, but difficult to implement, ABA technique of Task Analysis (TA). There are two overarching aims: 1) conduct scientifically-valid, clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of expert guiding technology to support instructors to better help individuals with developmental challenges due to ASD and ID learn life and vocational skills and use the results in Phase I to develop larger, more comprehensive clinical trials to be conducted in Phase II; and 2) use clinical trials in Phase I and Phase II to more effectively identify and prioritize iterative innovations in expert guiding technology as part of successive Design Science Research Cycles. Single Case Research Designs (SCRD) will be used to evaluate expert guiding technology interventions to support Task Analysis. SCRDs are a viable alternative to large group studies such as randomized clinical trials. Single case studies involve repeated measures, and manipulation of an independent variable. SCRD studies allow for rigorous experimental evaluation of intervention effects and provide a strong basis for establishing causal inferences. Advances in design and analysis techniques for SCRD have made SCRD studies increasingly popular in educational and psychological research. Chimes Delaware will be the site for clinical trials. Chimes Delaware is one of the largest providers of community services for adults with intellectual, autism, and co-occurring disabilities. The project team has worked together for many years and is uniquely qualified. If successful, the increase of scientifically-validated technical capabilities of expert guiding technology will profoundly affect clinical practice. The clinical trials proposed in this project will provide new scientific knowledge on the efficacy of expert guiding technology to overcome problems in delivering quality ABA therapy. Iterative innovations of expert guiding technology will greatly increase the technical capabilities.

"Scalable tools to effectively translate genomic discoveries into the clinic PROJECT SUMMARY We are in the midst of a genomic revolution; more than 250,000 human genomes have been sequenced, generating over a petabase of genomic data. While these new data hold great promise to impact health, there is a disconnect between genomic discovery and clinical care. Providers frequently misinterpret genomic information, patients often don't understand their own test results, and genomic information about disease risk is infrequently shared between patients and family members. Importantly, ineffective communication and data misinterpretation has devastating consequences- including unnecessary organ removal, missed disease prevention opportunities, and premature death. We are addressing these genomic care gaps by developing and testing tools that optimize the integration of whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing (WES, WGS) for general clinical practice. My vision for improving genomic medicine is based on my work within multidisciplinary consortia and addresses the National Human Genome Research Institute's priority research area of improving the effectiveness of healthcare. In the proposed work we will test the effectiveness of a multilevel genomic e-Health intervention in cancer (Aim 1). Our intervention 1) educates physicians and patients about genomics, 2) enables direct-to-patient return-of- results, 3) provides physicians with patient-specific results and resources for interpretation, and 4) facilitates sharing of genomic results within families. We hypothesize that intervention use will result in higher rates of uptake of high-quality, genetically guided care. We will test our hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial among academic and community physicians who use WES for their patients. Next, we will use an iterative process, with stakeholder engagement, to adapt and pilot test our tool for Spanish and Mandarin speaking patients and for patients who have diabetes (Aim 2). Finally, we will create and assess new, moderated, social networks as a platform for genomic information sharing (Aim 3). Our hypothesis is that providers, patients and family members will engage with the genomic information sharing social networks and find them to be highly useful. Our general approach includes 1) creating the secure social networks, 2) integrating the networks into our e-Health intervention, and 3) using complementary methods, such as interviews and natural language processing, to assess stakeholders' network-related attitudes and network information quality. If successful, we will be well positioned to widely disseminate our e-Health tools. In sum, this work stands to transform how people obtain, process and share genomic information in the context of clinical care. Our tools reconceive genetic communication to allow for multi-directional flow of information, connects multiple stakeholders with one another, and integrates high-quality dynamic web-based resources to improve genomic care. In creating and deploying tools that both respond to and leverage the complexities of our information environment, we intend to transform genomic research and clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE/ RELEVANCE OF PROJECT TO RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH Widespread utilization of genomic sequencing in medicine creates an urgent need to educate providers and patients. Currently, providers frequently misinterpret genomic information and patients often don't understand their own test results. In order to address this critical need, we propose to design and test multiple e-Health communication tools that will help providers and patients to better understand genomic data, lead to higher quality patient care, and facilitate genomic information sharing within families.",Scalable tools to effectively translate genomic discoveries into the clinic,9815293,R35HG010721,"['Address', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Community Physician', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human Genome', 'Information Networks', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Secure', 'Social Network', 'Sum', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'eHealth', 'exome', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'online resource', 'premature', 'tool', 'uptake', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE,R35,2019,556256,0.008200861854960606
"Advancing Quality and Outcomes Measurement in Rheumatology PROJECT SUMMARY Healthcare has changed rapidly in the last decade with the widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs) and the creation of national EHR-based data networks that aim to improve the quality of care. The American College of Rheumatology's RISE registry is a federally Qualified Clinical Data Registry that collects EHR data from the practices of almost 1000 rheumatologists nationally, analyzes these data centrally, and continuously feeds back performance on quality measures to practices via a web-based dashboard. In this K24 proposal, the applicant proposes to utilize novel methods in clinical informatics to increase the accuracy of quality measurement, while also developing and testing new EHR-based quality measures relevant to rheumatic diseases. The proposed research will leverage her strong research portfolio, including grants from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, her successful track record of achieving national endorsement for EHR-based quality measures, existing data from over 1.4 million patients in the RISE database, and the outstanding institutional environment at the University of California, San Francisco. It will also support her ongoing career development in clinical informatics methods relevant to EHR-based clinical research. For this five year K24 award proposal, she plans to increase the time spent mentoring junior investigators in the field or quality and outcomes measurement in rheumatology, with the goal of helping trainees successfully launch academic research careers in patient- oriented research. Aligned with a comprehensive mentoring plan, the proposal outlines two specific aims, including using natural language processing to increase the accuracy of EHR-based quality measurement in RISE, and developing and validating new, prototype electronic clinical quality measures to monitor and address high impact gaps in care for patients with rheumatic disease. The work will prioritize outcome measures and use eMeasurement standards, including the Quality Data Model and Health Quality Measures Format to develop, specify and test measures. Measures developed through this research and mentoring program will be candidates for nationwide dissemination across rheumatology practices to improve care for individuals with rheumatic disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This mid-career investigator award will support a program in patient-oriented research in rheumatic diseases at the University of California, San Francisco. The award will allow the applicant to expand her research on the development and validation of health care quality measures and support her mentoring of early investigators. The proposed research aims to create quality measures that can be deployed across rheumatology practices to improve the quality of care, while training new researchers to perform innovative patient-oriented research in the area of electronic health record-based quality and outcomes measurement.",Advancing Quality and Outcomes Measurement in Rheumatology,9645973,K24AR074534,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Feeds', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Preventive care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'college', 'dashboard', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'feeding', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning progression', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient registry', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research study', 'rheumatologist', 'success', 'tool']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2019,189666,-0.006583017821997427
"iDAPT: Implementation and Informatics - Developing Adaptable Processes and Technologies for Cancer Control PROJECT SUMMARY iDAPT Implementation and Informatics - Developing Adaptable Processes and Technologies for Cancer Control is a developing center with an emerging theme on the use of technologies to support rapid cycle and real time deployment and testing of implementation processes and adaptations within cancer control. The Administrative Core will manage the Center, ensure that iDAPT is engaged with “real world” clinical partners, patients, and families, is well-networked with the Implementation Science Centers in Cancer Control consortium, and engage in a comprehensive evaluation of Center activities and milestones. The Research Program will include an Implementation Studies Unit with an initial 2-year pilot study using adaptable technology to enhance shared decision-making in survivorship care planning for survivors of breast cancer. The Research Program also includes a Methods Unit with an initial innovation pilot study to test the feasibility of natural language processing to measure communication patterns pre-implementation and to monitor implementation fidelity of programs designed to enhance within-team and clinical team-to-patient electronic communication. The Research Program is expected to complete 8 to 10 pilot studies. In order to foster research aligned with iDAPT’s theme, we will build and sustain iDAPT’s Implementation Laboratory which incorporates capacity building and infrastructure for testing the use of technologies to support rapid cycle and real time deployment of implementation processes and adaptations within cancer control. The laboratory includes primary care and oncology clinics in our local “Hubs” in southern Appalachia (North Carolina) and the northeast (Massachusetts) and “Spokes” including over 900 community-based oncology clinics in the NCIs National Community Oncology Research Program and nationwide Veteran’s Administration clinics. iDAPTs leadership is a multi-disciplinary team of experts with extensive experience in cancer-focused implementation science, behavioral science, computer engineering and computer science, clinical informatics, formative qualitative methods, epidemiology, and biostatistics.

"Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation Project Summary Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a time-sensitive resuscitation procedure! essential for ventilation of newborns. It requires an unusually high level of skill due to the narrow airways, relatively large tongue, anterior glottic position, and low respiratory reserve of neonates (Bercic, Pocajt et al. 1978). Given the difficulty of the procedure and the high rate of complications in untrained hands, effective training is crucial. However, intubation success rates for pediatric residents are low under current resuscitation training programs and show little improvement between years 1-3 of residency (23-25%) (O'Donnell, Kamlin et al. 2006; Haubner, Barry et al. 2013). There is a pressing need to understand the factors that lead to poor training results and for innovative training modalities that can bridge the gap left by traditional training and thereby allow rapid skill acquisition. We hypothesize that current training and assessment methods suffer from 4 key weaknesses: (1) Poor realism: manikin and simulator-based training typically provide little variation in anatomy or difficulty level—key requirements for developing expertise (Dreyfus, Athanasiou et al. 1986)—and do not realistically model the look, feel, and motions of real tissue. (2) Subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods: training opportunities are limited by the availability of expert instructors. (3) Poor visualization: learners have poor knowledge about what went wrong and how to improve; they cannot see exactly what is going on inside the manikin or the patient and cannot directly monitor their actions relative to idealized, expert performance. (4) Assessment under artificially ideal conditions: assessments of ETI performance in classroom settings likely overestimate trainees' skill level because they do not mimic the stressors and distractions that are inherent in the real clinical environment. Technology-enhanced ETI simulators can resolve all of these key weaknesses: We have conducted preliminary work (Hahn, Li et al. 2016; Soghier, Li et al. 2014) on an augmented reality (AR (Azuma 1997)) manikin simulator driven by the motions of the trainee and physical manikin in real time that 1) provides a quantitative assessment of ETI technique and 2) allows the trainee to visualize the motion of the laryngoscope inside the manikin. The assessment score can provide feedback during the performance, as well as constitute part of the evaluation of the trainee's skill. Work under this proposal will build on this preliminary work. The specific aims are to: extend the current augmented reality (AR) manikin simulator to a virtual reality (VR) computer simulator and validate, extend and validate automated assessment and visualization algorithm for ETI, study training effectiveness by testing groups of pediatric residents across 3 years to quantify the effect of technology-enhanced methods relative to the current training regimen in terms of both intubation performance on simulators and clinical outcomes in patients, and assess performance under more realistic conditions. Project Narrative The current training and assessment of neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) suffers from key weaknesses of 1) poor realism of task simulators, 2) subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods, 3) poor visualization during simulation, and 4) assessment methods under artificially ideal conditions. This high-yield proposal will bridge the gap between training and clinical practice by using quantitative assessment tools and technology-enhanced simulation to improve ETI performance prior to patient care.",Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation,9732337,R01HD091179,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Hand', 'Imagery', 'Intratracheal Intubation', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatology', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Regimen', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'distraction', 'evidence base', 'haptics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'training opportunity', 'virtual reality']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,318886,-0.00773234161608754
"Changing Talk Online (CHATO): A Pragmatic Trial to Reduce Behavioral Symptoms in Dementia Care ABSTRACT  The growing population of persons with dementia presents challenges to providing high quality nursing home (NH) care. Care is complicated by behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as persons with dementia lose cognitive and communication abilities and cannot verbally express unmet physical and psychosocial needs. NH staff use “elderspeak,” speech similar to baby talk that is demeaning to residents. Residents react to elderspeak with BPSD resulting in increased use of psychotropic medication to control BPSD, higher staffing needs, more staff stress and turnover, and increased costs. The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff about elderspeak and better communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and BPSD in NH residents. The next step to increase the impact of this effective classroom-based training is to test CHAT content provided in online internet modules. CHAT training Online (CHATO) can improve access for busy staff and those in rural and small NHs to increase dissemination across care settings to improve dementia care.  This R61/R33 study will develop and conduct a pragmatic clinical trial in response to PAR-18-585, Pragmatic Trials for Dementia Care I Long-term Services and Support (LTSS) Settings. We will test the effects of CHATO training on resident BPSD and psychotropic medication use in 120 NHs. In the R61 planning phase we will pilot test the online modules with NH staff to establish effects; recruit NH sites for the R33 trial; develop the clinical trial protocol, manual of operations, and data forms; develop data management, sharing, and fidelity assurance protocols; and obtain IRB approvals. A panel of NH administrators and staff will advise the team on recruitment strategies and a natural processing elderspeak feedback app will be tested in the clinical setting.  In R33 phase we will conduct the pragmatic trial in 120 NHs that will be randomly assigned to CHATO training or to the control group. BPSD and psychotropic medication rate data, extracted from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Nursing Home Compare and Minimum Data Set, will be compared using linear mixed modeling. NH strategies used to engage staff in CHATO (paid time off, recognition) and costs will be identified. The effects of a self-monitoring app that uses natural language processing to give staff immediate feedback on their elderspeak use will be tested. This research addresses NIA's milestones for nonpharmacological dementia care interventions, the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease goal to enhance care quality and efficiency, and the Alzheimer's Association Plan to build a workforce with high-quality care skills. The goal of reducing inappropriate use of psychoactive medications to control BPSD using this nonpharmacological approach aligns with the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care. As the number of persons diagnosed with dementia triples in the next 30 years, empowering care providers to provide high quality care for individuals with dementia is of critical importance. NARRATIVE The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease has identified education of dementia care providers as a top priority to address the critical need for quality care for the population of persons with dementia that will triple in the next 30 years. This R61/R33 pragmatic clinical trial will test interactive online communication training for nursing home staff to reduce ineffective elderspeak communication, with anticipated reductions in behavioral symptoms and inappropriate use of antipsychotic medications in residents with dementia.

"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care. The proposed project stresses the translation of basic computer science into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.",Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication,9650545,R01DC009834,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Infrastructure', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Movement', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Role', 'Running', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visual evoked cortical potential', 'Vocabulary', 'Writing', 'acronyms', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive system', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'engineering design', 'experimental study', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'learning strategy', 'literacy', 'mindfulness meditation', 'multimodality', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'patient population', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'residence', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'skills', 'spelling', 'statistics', 'syntax', 'technology development', 'time interval', 'usability', 'vigilance']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,655251,-0.039039331938169775
"STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias (ADRD) are debilitating conditions affecting more than 5 million Americans in 2014. It is projected that 8.4 million people with be diagnosed with ADRD over the next 15 years and health care costs attributable to ADRD are projected to be more than $1.2 trillion by 2050. Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are common and often involve aggressive behavior towards family caregivers (CG) in response to unmet needs, discomfort, or frustration. BPSD frequently lead to CG seeking medication to control patient symptoms. Antipsychotic use in persons with dementia (PWD) more than doubles mortality risk. The Choosing Wisely Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and American Geriatrics Society both recommend against prescribing antipsychotics as a first-line treatment for BPSD. Behavioral interventions such as STAR-Caregivers are efficacious first-line treatments for managing BPSD endorsed by the Administration on Aging. However, the programs have not been implemented widely – partly due to the intensity/cost of the programs and difficulty conducting outreach. No study has investigated CG willingness to reduce or discontinue antipsychotic use. We propose a Stage III clinical trial to ascertain the feasibility and acceptability of STAR Virtual Training and Follow-up (STAR- VTF) in which (a) training materials are delivered electronically and learning is self-directed, (b) caregivers have two in-home visits with a social worker and (c) where caregivers receive support from a social worker via secure messaging (email) within a web-based portal. We will compare outcomes in the STAR-VTF group to an attention control group (mailed material plus generic secure messages). Our specific aims are: (1) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of STAR-VTF to caregivers; (2) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program from the payer perspective; and (3) Test the hypotheses that (H1) caregiver participants in STAR-VTF will have lower levels of caregiver burden at 8 weeks and 6 months compared to an attention control group; and (H2) PWD participants in STAR-VTF will have lower rates of daily antipsychotic medication use at 6 months compared to attention control. We propose to recruit 100 CG-PWD dyads (50 in each arm). This will be the first study to test a low intensity, self-directed caregiver training program with secure message support from social workers. It will also be the first study to measure changes in antipsychotic medication use by PWD after CG training. The study is also innovative because it brings together leading experts in caregiver training, health information management, and care management. Third, this will be the first study to use automated data and natural language processing to identify potential caregivers in need of education/support at a time when antipsychotic medication use begins. Results of this study will inform a future multi-site trial in the Mental Health Research Network. NARRATIVE Our study evaluates the effectiveness of a caregiver outreach, training, and support program for caregivers of people with dementia who are using antipsychotic medication to manage agitation/aggression. We will conduct a randomized trial of the caregiver program compared to a control group to measure differences in caregiver burden and discontinuation of antipsychotic medication use. The results will help in expanding access to and delivery of empirically supported behavioral health services for caregivers and people with dementia.",STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up,9791152,R01AG061926,"['Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'American Psychiatric Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'E-learning', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Family Caregiver', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Improve Access', 'Information Management', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Program Acceptability', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Direction', 'Site', 'Social Workers', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'Travel', 'Washington', 'arm', 'attentional control', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'caregiver depression', 'caregiver education', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multi-site trial', 'outreach', 'payment', 'pragmatic trial', 'program costs', 'programs', 'psychological symptom', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'response', 'retiree', 'secondary outcome', 'time use', 'urgent care', 'virtual', 'willingness']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,546052,0.01966515596395859
"Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI) Project Summary/Abstract  Substance misuse is inconsistently addressed in routine medical practice. Primary care physicians frequently fail to diagnose substance abuse when presented with early symptoms of alcohol or drug use. Patients report that less than one-third of primary care physicians carefully screen them for substance abuse, in spite of available and effective screening protocols. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an integrated, evidence-based approach aimed at delivering early intervention for drug and alcohol misuse in medical settings and has been demonstrated to reduce substance misuse. Motivational Interviewing (MI), an underlying component of SBIRT, is an evidence-based, brief interventional approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors. Unfortunately, the MI approach is very difficult to teach to practitioners as it is counterintuitive to most providers who commonly take a directive approach with patients. Because of ineffective training, MI and SBIRT are under-utilized.  The primary goal of this project is to transform MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that analyzes practitioner responses and gives immediate feedback to improve MI skills. Our team has been developing and testing a training tool that uses natural language processing (NLP) to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI). ReadMI is a low cost, ultra-portable solution for accurate and automatic real-time assessment of dialog during the course of MI training. It makes use of the latest advances in deep-learning-based speech recognition and mobile and cloud computing technologies to enable instantaneous MI training assessment and analysis. Currently functioning with 92% accuracy, ReadMI provides immediate feedback to MI and SBIRT trainees regarding the number of open- and closed-ended questions asked, provider-vs-patient conversation time, and other integral components of MI.  ReadMI will advance the skill development of physicians and other healthcare professionals in their use of MI and SBIRT, minimizing the need for time-consuming reviews of recorded training sessions. Our aims are: 1) develop ReadMI to provide MI training metrics with 95% accuracy and 2) test ReadMI in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 200 medical students and residents, 100 who will receive SBIRT/MI training with ReadMI and 100 who will serve as the control group, receiving customary SBIRT/MI training.  The prospective applications of ReadMI extend far beyond substance use disorder (SUD) prevention, detection, and intervention. The effectiveness of all chronic disease management is largely dependent on patient behavior. MI is a patient-focused conversation between the provider and the patient that reinforces the patient's motivation to make positive changes in health-related behavior. By making efficient MI training available to more health professionals, ReadMI will improve healthcare quality as providers are better equipped in their efforts to help patients make healthy lifestyle changes. Project Narrative Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors, including substance misuse. However, MI and a specific application of MI to substance misuse known as SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) are underutilized because of inadequate training of health professionals. This research aims to revolutionize MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that uses natural language processing to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI).",Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI),9824096,R21HS026548,[' '],AHRQ,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,174994,-0.05414876428474275
"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,9687744,K01HL141538,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Deglutition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palate', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Shapes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prophylactic', 'side effect', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support tools', 'systematic review', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2019,143581,0.011947574652087019
"CPS: AutoWean: Foundations of Autonomous Medical CPS for Mechanical Ventilation Weaning   While mechanical ventilators provide life-saving respiratory support, prolonged acute mechanical ventilation (PAMV) can lead to severe complications (e.g. , pneumonia) and increased healthcare costs - predicted to be over $32 billion in 2020 and accounting for over 10% of all hospital costs. Thus, mechanical ventilation needs to be discontinued as early as possible, often by using a process known as ""weaning"". However, the best approach to weaning remains an open question and is subject to controversy, where estimated 170,000 preventable deaths per year in US intensive care units are a result of inappropriate ventilator weaning. Consequently, the Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) lists improper ventilator settings as a Top 10 Health Technology Hazard in 2019.  Autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning exemplifies a medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) that requires collections of interconnected medical devices (e.g., ventilators and patient monitors) that are coordinated for treating a patient (i.e. , performing safe autonomous weaning). This proposal aims to develop fundamental advances in safe and effective data-driven context-aware human-in-the-loop control that will enable autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning . While closed-loop control and data-driven techniques (e.g., system identification and machine learning) have been applied to MCPS, assuring the safety and reliability of using data-driven components that adapt in-the-loop with a human operator remains a challenge. We will demonstrate the impact of our closed-loop design and analysis techniques in autonomous MCPS for mechanical ventilation weaning .  The proposed project directly aligns with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) through the research and development of new technologies to advance medical care through medical device interoperability and clinical decision support for enabling autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning. Also relevant to the NIBIB mission, achieving the aims of this project requires a multidisciplinary approach and complementary advances in computer science and clinical care. From the healthcare perspective, this project will offer evidence-based and personalized decision support to caregivers for better mechanical ventilation weaning. The long-term impact of autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning pain will lead to shorter hospital stays, reduce the economic burden of health care, and reduce the deadly side effects of inappropriate weaning. This project concerns development of technologies to quantify and enable autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning , where, currently, the best approach to weaning remains an open question and is subject to controversy.

"BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study Patients increasingly survive critical care, but for many the experience is psychologically tormenting in part because they lose all control over their environment. Patients with neurological injury in particular suffer from this major loss of autonomy which impacts their long term recovery. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology transforms physiological changes associated with patient thoughts into actionable outputs. The technology is rapidly advancing and well established outside of the critical care setting. The goal of this project is to determine whether conscious and unconscious appearing ICU patients are able to communicate their basic needs, such as pain, hunger, and thirst, to health care providers using the BCI technology. We will apply a bedside BCI system in the ICU using a machine-learning algorithm that analyzes changes in routine EEG in response to standardized questions presented to the patient by headphones. The BCI system will provide immediate closed- loop feedback (auditory and/or visual) to patients about their performance. To achieve our goals, we will first test if conscious ICU patients are able to express basic needs, such as pain, to health care providers using the BCI technology. Patients will trigger the BCI system to then express their needs in response to specific questions (e.g., “Do you have pain?”). Secondly, we will determine whether basic communication is possible for patients with cognitive motor dissociation (i.e., patients who appear unconscious, but follow commands using EEG motor imagery paradigms). We will test if these patients are able to use the BCI system to respond to simple questions (i.e., “Activate the alarm”). Finally, we will assess the patient's experience using BCI technology as part of this study, as well as acceptance of using BCI technology in future clinical trials from patients, families, and health care providers involved in the study. The long-term goal of this proposal is to prepare a large clinical trial to test the benefits of BCI-assisted communication in brain-injured ICU patients. Patients in critical care suffer an almost complete loss of control over their most basic needs (e.g., they are unable to tell someone that they are hungry), which is stressful and impacts their long term recovery. This is a major problem for the many patients with acute brain injury. We propose to make technology available that would allow even some unresponsive‐appearing patients to communicate these needs with care givers and family members.",BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study,9808271,R03NS112760,"['Acute Brain Injuries', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Auditory', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Conscious', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Fever', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hunger', 'Imagery', 'Imagination', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Label', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patient Education', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Recovery', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Thirst', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unconscious State', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'improved', 'injured', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized strategies', 'practical application', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sound', 'willingness']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2019,81000,-0.025472676547733525
"Personalized Digital Behavior Change Interventions to Promote Oral Health Although preventable, dental disease is one of the most common chronic diseases in the United States and exacts a substantial personal and societal toll. It is closely linked to low oral health literacy and poor oral hygiene behaviors (OHBs). Using the high prevalence and burden of dental disease as a proxy, there is a large gap between knowledge about quality oral hygiene routines and what is practiced by individuals. The causes are many but ultimately distill down to a systemic failure to communicate oral hygiene instructions (OHIs) effectively or to engage and motivate patients in their own oral self-care.  To address the know-do gap, we begin by distilling desired brushing behaviors into a simple 2x2x4 OHI (brushing 2 times a day, for 2 minutes each time, all 4 dental quadrants). We will leverage tracking capabilities of our innovative eBrush platform to remotely monitor tooth-brushing activities in home settings. Using the 2x2x4 OHI and eBrush as foundational elements, we will develop and evaluate the effectiveness of personalized Digital Oral Health Interventions (DOHI) for promoting ideal OHBs in at-risk individuals. In the UG3 phase, we will build out the technologic infrastructure for collecting brushing data and delivering the DOHI. Then, we will engage target end-users in the co-design of an app for oral self-care and establish the usability and feasibility of the system. In the UH3 phase, we will build and validate computational models to infer the quality of OHBs from brushing data and personalize the DOHI. Using a cohort of 130, we will conduct a 10-week Micro-Randomized Trial to optimize the adaptive tailoring of engagement strategies. Finally, we will evaluate effectiveness of the computationally-driven, adaptive DOHI in promoting sustained engagement in the 2x2x4 OHB. We hypothesize that a dynamic and personalized DOHI will be more effective than traditional, static, clinician-delivered OHI in improving oral health and adherence to 2x2x4 OHBs. We will test our hypothesis through a 6-month, pragmatic, randomized, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. Eligible adults from safety-net dental clinics will be equipped with an electronic toothbrush and the smartphone app for tracking brushing data. After a run-in period (4 weeks) to ensure technical proficiency and establish baseline OHBs, 260 at-risk subjects will receive a clinician-delivered 2x2x4 OHI and randomized to either: (a) an intervention arm where subjects receive ongoing, personalized DOHIs at opportune times; or (b) a control arm where subjects lack such feedback. Subjects will be followed for 20 weeks. Trained dental examiners will conduct assessments at each visit (baseline, randomization and after 20 weeks). Primary outcomes are changes in dental health from baseline (Modified Gingival Index and Plaque Index). Secondary outcome is the quality of adherence to the 2x2x4 OHI. We will explore subject-level features that predict the magnitude of response to the DOHI. Our team science approach presents a potentially paradigm shifting opportunity to leverage the growing ubiquity and reach of digital technologies to activate, educate, and engage patients in optimal oral health self-care in ways and at a scale previously unimaginable. 3c.

"Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform Background. Research has identified a wide range of evidence-based interventions for key behavioral health risks such as poor diet, smoking, unhealthy alcohol use, or a sedentary lifestyle. However, to be truly successful, behavioral intervention science should fulfill at least three key criteria: (1) demonstration of cumulative increases in intervention efficacy; (2) provision of interventions that reach a high proportion of those in need; and (3) demonstration of a meaningful population impact/reduction in disease burden. It currently meets none of these. Some reasons for this include (1) over-reliance on an imprecise delivery mechanism (people; usually therapists or coaches of some kind) that is difficult to train to fidelity on a large scale, and that cannot be manipulated with precision; (2) use of sample sizes that may be far below what is needed to accurately characterize heterogeneity of response; and (3) cross-study variability in therapist characteristics, sample characteristics, and measurement strategy. All of this combines to create a science that lacks evidence of cumulative improvements upon prior benchmarks. Proposed solution. Mobile technology shows significant promise as an intervention delivery mechanism that is replicable, transparent, modular, and precise. However, progress in the development and implementation of mobile interventions has been slowed by factors such as the tremendous time and money needed to develop an intervention; limitations in cross-platform compatibility and interoperability; and lack of a consistent system around which to collaborate. To address these needs, the PI developed the Computerized Intervention Authoring System (CIAS), which facilitates behavioral intervention science by allowing investigators to directly develop sophisticated and interactive mobile applications without programming. CIAS is already being used by investigators outside of the PI’s own lab, a process that has revealed significant interest in this software from a wide range of NIH-funded investigators, as well as significant limitations. Current aims. The proposed application will address these limitations, making CIAS into a significant, open-source, and virtually unique non-commercial research resource. In Aim 1, we will engage in sustained user experience testing designed to make the tool far more intuitive to use. This process is expected to result in a dramatic reorganization of the investigator interface, as well as in a complete set of evidence-based user training and support materials. In Aim 2, we will add a range of features and capabilities to make CIAS more powerful, flexible, and interoperable (e.g., by building to SMART Health IT standards, as well as FHIR open specifications to facilitate integration with Electronic Health Records). In Aim 3, we will engage in focused efforts to promote the use of CIAS as part of multi-lab collaborations using open science practices (e.g., via integration with the Open Science Framework). Importantly, we will engage in all of the above with the assistance of a highly accomplished panel of advisors who will help ensure that the final product is broadly relevant, future-facing, and usable to a broad range of behavioral scientists. Technology-delivered interventions are showing great potential to help people modify unhealthy behaviors like substance use, poor diet, and poor medication adherence. However, designing these interventions is time- consuming and expensive, which is slowing down research in this area as well as the rate at which such technology can help people. This project will take existing research software and significantly enhance it so it can allow scientists to easily and quickly collaborate to develop powerful interventions for mobile devices.","Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform",9882671,U24EB028990,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Apple', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Budgets', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Documentation', 'Eating', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SMART health', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoking', 'Support System', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'alcohol misuse', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brief intervention', 'burden of illness', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'good diet', 'handheld mobile device', 'healthy weight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'intervention effect', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'open data', 'open source', 'prevent', 'reduced substance use', 'repository', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'software development', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'user centered design', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIBIB,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2019,399297,-0.01087232279678618
"Using Information Technology to Improve Outcomes for Children Living with Cancer This application plans to develop a program, Symptom Monitoring & Systematic Assessment and Reporting System in Young Survivors (SyMon-SAYS), to enable timely mitigation and management of unrelieved symptoms for children with cancer. The SyMon-SAYS will administer, score, interpret and display the results of symptom assessments in “real-time” between clinic visits in cancer care ambulatory settings, when patients are likely to be more symptomatic. We hypothesize that this system can facilitate prompt identification of problematic symptoms; consequently, with the availability of graphical symptom reports over time, timely providers’ clinical care, and an informative symptom management booklet, patients will become informed about their condition and take an active role in treatment, which will further improve self-management skills. Better self-management promotes adherence to treatment plans, builds individual capacity, improves interaction between patients and caregivers, reduces the use of medical specialists, and optimizes clinical outcomes across the lifespan throughout the treatment and disease continua. The proposed waitlist control randomized trial is based on our preliminary study testing the feasibility of the patient-centered SyMon-SAYS in a pediatric oncology clinic. Results showed that the SyMon-SAYS was acceptable to patients/parents and they were willing to use it during their routine clinical care. Clinicians expressed interest in receiving reports yet preferred to review them in the medical record. Based on what we learned from this pilot, we now propose to integrate the SyMon-SAYS system into the electronic health record (EHR), to streamline the alert notification with clinician workflow by using EHR (Epic) messaging, and to include a broader range of symptoms. Patients and parents will complete the weekly symptom assessment and review the symptom report by logging into the Epic MyChart patient portal. Instead of using a standalone SyMon-SAYS app, we will align the SyMon-SAYS program with the Epic EHR. We plan to conduct a single institution modified waitlist control randomized trial of 200 children (ages 8-17) with cancer over 16 weeks (Group A: 16-week SyMon-SAYS intervention; Group B: 8-week usual care and then 8-week SyMon-SAYS intervention) to achieve the following specific aims: 1) evaluate effectiveness of SyMon-SAYS at week-8 and its maintenance effects at week-16. We hypothesize that Group A (versus Group B) will report decreased parent-perceived barriers to managing their children’s symptoms, decreased patient symptom burden, increased patient and parent self-efficacy, and ultimately increased patient HRQOL at week-8 and no significant differences between Groups A & B at week-16; 2) evaluate influential factors to Aim 1, including contextual patient and parent factors, adherence to the SyMon- SAYS intervention, and symptom communication; and 3) evaluate predictors of adherence to the SyMon-SAYS intervention and preference of SyMon-SAYS versus usual care. Project Narrative This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the Symptom Monitoring & Systematic Assessment and Reporting System in Young Survivors program (SyMon-SAYS) for children with cancer in decreasing patients’ symptom burden, decreasing parent-perceived barriers in managing their child’s symptoms, increasing patients’ and parents’ self-efficacy and increasing patients’ quality of life.

"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,9785527,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2019,192917,0.009822134720437156
"Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research Unit SUMMARY   Approximately  25%  of  diabetic  patients  experience  diabetic  foot  ulcers  (DFUs).  This  is  a  significant  clinical  problem since there are no effective biomarkers for predicting outcomes, no drug candidates that have recently  been  FDA-­approved  and  no  therapies  that  are  widely  effective  in  treatment.  The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  2014  with  the  sole  purpose  of  facilitating  clinical  trials,  conducting  translational  research  and  providing  care  for  patients  with  chronic  wounds.  Stanford  AWCC  receives  patients  from the University Healthcare Alliance, which spans 60 clinics and 2.5 million people in the San Francisco Bay  Area.  Despite  being  in  a  relatively  prosperous  area,  Stanford  AWCC  treats  patients  from  diverse  socio-­ demographics. In the past two years, Stanford has treated 6000 patients with wounds, of whom 705 had DFUs.  50%  of  the  patients  enroll  in  clinical  trials  and  there  is  a  very  low  dropout  rate  (less  than  5%).  Under  Dr.  Geoffrey  Gurtner’s  leadership,  the  Stanford  AWCC  has  conducted  over  25  clinical  trials,  where  we  have  measured biomarkers and tested novel therapeutic interventions (Aim 1).     It is known that wound healing trials experience a significantly higher failure rate in Phase III studies compared  to  any  other  drug  trial.  This  is  primarily  due  to  the  poorly  controlled  procedural  component  of  wound  care.  At  Stanford,  we  address  these  issues  by  (i)  practicing  a  multi-­disciplinary  approach  overseen  by  physicians,  (ii)  standardizing  the  measuring  and  reporting  of  healing  outcomes,  (iii)  emphasizing  rigorous  and  efficient  operational  processes  during  clinical  trial  conduct  and  (iv)  collaborating  with  other  major  academic  centers  (Aim  2).  Looking  forward,  it  is  critical  to  optimize  patient  engagement  during  their  treatment  regimens  and  inculcate  a  shared  decision-­making  process.  Clinical  studies  in  medical  fields  such  as  cancer  have  indicated  that  such  patient-­centered  approaches  lead  to  the  adherence  of  treatment  regimens  and  clinical  trials.  This  is  currently  lacking  in  with  patients  with  DFUs.  With  Dr.  Arden  Morris’s  expertise,  the  Stanford  AWCC  practices  new approaches that centers around the patient, with a focus on improvement in their quality of life (Aim 3).     Dr.  Nigam  Shah,  the  Director  of  Bioinformatics  at  Spectrum,  Stanford’s  Clinical  and  Translational  Sciences  Award  has  worked  with  the  Stanford  AWCC  and  developed  computational  tools  that  predict  wound  healing  outcomes. These models have been developed using data from the Healogics database, the country’s largest  network  of  wound  care  clinics  and  a  Stanford  AWCC  operational  partner.  Dr.  Shah  also  has  expertise  in  analyzing electronic health records of patients from large databases such as TRUVEN and OPTUM, which will  allow  for  the  determination  of  unique  biomarkers  for  wound  healing  through  computational  modeling.  These  models can be executed across the entire Diabetic Foot Consortium (Aim 4).    Narrative    The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  October  2014  to  fill  both  a  clinical  and  academic  need  by  integrating  clinical  trials  and  research  in  wound  care.  Since  its  launch,  the  number  of  patients  with  DFUs  at  Stanford  AWCC  has  doubled  in  each  of  the  past  two  years  and  the  unit  has  been  financially  successful,  ensuring  its  long-­term  viability.  Here,  we  demonstrate  the  ability  of  Stanford  AWCC  to  serve  as  a  Clinical  Research  Unit  (CRU)  by  displaying  access  to  patients  with  DFUs  from  a  wide  sociodemographic, emphasizing quality of clinical research conducted, demonstrating ways of patient-­centered  collaborative decision making and using big data to accurately predict and quantify wound healing outcomes.           ",Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research

"Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Patient-Reported Outcome (RISE-PRO) Dissemination Project PROJECT SUMMARY Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are important in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a condition that affects 1.3 million Americans and is a leading cause of disability. Among chronic conditions, RA has many decades of robust scientific evidence around the validity of PROs. PROs are key outcome measures in RA clinical trials and studies, are responsive to therapy changes, are strong predictors of future disability and mortality, and play a central role in facilitating shared decision-making and treatment. Advances in health information technology (IT), like electronic health record-enabled Qualified Clinical Data Registries (QCDRs), provide an opportunity to scale and spread of use of PRO measures nationally. The Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness (RISE) registry is a QCDR that was established in 2014 to improve the quality of care for patients seen in rheumatology practices. The RISE informatics platform aggregates electronic health record data from participating practices, analyzes these data centrally and feeds performance on quality measures back to clinicians using a web-based dashboard. RISE currently includes one the largest PRO measurement efforts for ambulatory patients with a chronic disease in the United States. However, as the registry matures, several critical gaps remain in our national PRO measurement efforts, including the lack of representation of public hospital systems and at-risk populations, the challenges faced by some practices in creating structured data fields in electronic health records to capture PRO measure scores, and the need to evaluate the impact of the PRO collection efforts through RISE. The overarching goal of this proposal is to systematically address each of these issues by 1) creating an evidence-based clinical learning network to support the participation of public hospital systems in PRO measurement and improvement efforts through RISE, 2) developing and scaling a natural language processing system to extract PRO measures from unstructured data in clinical notes, and 3) analyzing the impact of PRO measurement through RISE on quality of care and health outcomes in RA. This proposal builds on the novel informatics platform of the RISE registry to scale, spread and evaluate PRO implementation across a nationwide network of rheumatology practices, with the ultimate goal of improving functional status outcomes for those with RA. PROJECT NARRATIVE The RISE-PRO project aims to use the novel health IT platform of the RISE patient registry to scale, spread and evaluate the collection of patient-reported outcomes across a nationwide network of rheumatology practices. Collecting and using patient-reported outcomes in clinical practice has the potential to transform health care for individuals with rheumatoid arthritis by making care more patient-centered and by providing tools to facilitate shared decision-making, disease monitoring, and population health management.",Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Patient-Reported Outcome (RISE-PRO) Dissemination Project,9735244,R18HS025638,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R18,2019,494501,-0.00865370492000454
"Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems V (CAHPS V) Consumers, providers and health care purchasers need high-quality information to help them compare and evaluate their health care options. The CAHPS V project will advance the AHRQ CAHPS mission of improving patients' experiences with health care by developing and evaluating strategies for survey measurement, reporting and quality improvement (QI). We propose a 5-year effort to advance the science and practice of patient experience assessment, continue innovation to ensure relevance to health service delivery and implement best survey practices, further the science of reporting, and evaluate CAHPS QI efforts. We will develop program communication strategies, and disseminate and promote use of CAHPS products. In particular, we will develop a survey to assess patient experiences with end-of-life care; develop new items to assess shared decision-making, care coordination, patient engagement, and patient safety; test alternatives to the standard CAHPS modes of data collection), explore the feasibility of administering a short-form survey dividing CG-CAHPS composites among respondents to reduce response burden, elicit stakeholder feedback about the value of different CAHPS supplement item sets, evaluate “The Your CAHPS Survey” that was designed to help users of the CAHPS surveys compile a survey tailed to their specific needs, and evaluate existing Spanish translations of CAHPS surveys. In addition, we will gather input from stakeholders on best practices for narrative data analysis, develop an approach for using automated Natural Language Processing for analyses of narratives, and construct an algorithm approach to select representative narratives that reflect and illustrate overall provider ratings. Finally, we will evaluate the contribution of patient narratives to quality improvement efforts in hospital care for children, characterize primary care practices use of the CG-CAHPS survey and patient-centered medical home items during PCMH transformation, assess the impact of pay- for-performance for care delivered by primary and specialty care safety net providers on CAHPS survey responses, explore the value of new shared decision-making, patient engagement, communication and patient safety items for QI and identify QI strategies that improve patient experience across various settings. We will also advance analytic methods for CAHPS data. The project team is well suited to achieving the study objectives given its prior accomplishments and established working relationships. The work is innovative and designed to facilitate the use of CAHPS surveys and improve response rates to them, enhance reporting and use of CAHPS survey data, and improve health care QI efforts.

"A Training and Fidelity Model to Move and Scale Evidence-based Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Programs into Practice: The Case for COPE in PACE service settings This NIA Stage I study is designed to address two leading barriers to implementation of evidence-based dementia care and caregiver support programs into long-term care settings: (1) lack of streamlined, user-friendly, and tested training modalities, and (2) lack of scalable, practical processes to accurately measure fidelity in “real world” settings. The aims of the study are to determine whether an online training program is the same or better in improving interventionist fidelity to an evidence based dementia program (COPE) and dementia patient outcomes when compared to a high intensity face-to-face traditional form of training. To accomplish these aims we will develop an online, principle-driven approach using state-of-the- science simulation and best practices and a scalable approach to assess fidelity to COPE by applying computational linguistics techniques. We will then conduct a noninferiority trial in Programs for All Inclusive Care for Elders (PACE) organizations randomly assigned to the training conditions. PACE staff will be evaluated post training on their fidelity outcomes. Dyads of persons with dementia and their caregivers will be evaluated at 4 months post COPE implementation on function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and caregiver burden. The findings from this project will lay the essential groundwork for a large scale, Stage III-IV, pragmatic trial of COPE in PACE settings throughout the US. Findings will also serve as a model for guiding the development of practical, scalable processes for training and fidelity monitoring in other long-term care settings and for other evidence-based support programs. Most persons with dementia and their caregivers do not have access to or receive beneficial and supportive evidence-based programs due to the need for scalable and reliable training and monitoring procedures for clinicians. We address this gap to developing and testing a replicable, accessible, and sustainable processes for training and monitoring clinicians in Care of Persons in the Environments (COPE) - an evidence based dementia care program - in a long-term care service setting. Study findings will yield an understanding of ways to move evidence into real-world dementia care settings and can serve as a model for guiding the development of practical, scalable processes for training and fidelity monitoring in other long-term care settings and for other evidence-based support programs.",A Training and Fidelity Model to Move and Scale Evidence-based Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Programs into Practice: The Case for COPE in PACE service settings,9789806,R01AG061945,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver support', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Day Care', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Registered nurse', 'Science', 'Service setting', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'care providers', 'care systems', 'comparative efficacy', 'dementia care', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'pragmatic trial', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'uptake', 'user-friendly']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,525499,0.0446597008855921
"Leveraging Routine Clinical Materials and Mobile Technology to Assess CBT Quality Project Abstract: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been demonstrated to be effective for numerous presenting problems, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Several large mental health systems have invested heavily in programs to train their clinicians in CBTs, but relatively little attention has been devoted to the monitoring or promotion of CBT quality after training is complete. Identifying strategies to do so can facilitate research and training, and is critical to ensuring consumer access to high quality, evidence-based treatments. The lack of a scalable, effective, and efficient method of monitoring quality is a key barrier to efforts to promote high-quality implementation. Self-report fidelity assessments increase clinician and consumer burden and may not accurately reflect clinician skill or the intensity with which CBT interventions are delivered. Observation and expert ratings are time and resource intensive and unlikely to be feasible or affordable in large systems. To maximize the likelihood of broad implementation once effective strategies to monitor quality are established, it is essential that these strategies are feasible and acceptable in routine care contexts, leveraging information collected during routine care. To date, few monitoring strategies that do not involve observation, client/caregiver reports, or clinician self-reports have been tested. To address this critical implementation challenge, we propose to refine and evaluate a method of monitoring quality that is based on an evaluation of CBT worksheets that are completed in session. Because the worksheets were developed to implement core cognitive and behavioral elements and are embedded in CBTs across diagnostic categories, they may be used to elucidate the clinician’s ability to guide the client through CBT interventions in session. Preliminary research with this measure demonstrated high correlations between the measure and observer ratings of clinician competence, associations with subsequent symptom change, and high agreement between raters with differing levels of familiarity with CBT. Completion of the ratings based on worksheets requires only a small fraction of time required for session observation and ratings. This project will compare this novel strategy to observer ratings and adherence checklists that are embedded in clinical notes. Furthermore, it will compare the accuracy of worksheet data collected by mobile app to paper-form worksheets, and assess the feasibility and acceptability of these strategies. Because the core elements of CBT and its worksheets are common across many CBTs, this research has broad implications for monitoring fidelity to CBTs in a variety of mental health and healthcare systems and settings. This research will be conducted by a team of investigators with expertise in CBT, training, implementation, psychotherapy process and outcome research, psychometrics, longitudinal data analysis, mobile technologies and healthcare economics, with input from community partners and end-users. The resulting products have the potential to significantly improve efforts to monitor and ensure ongoing high quality implementation of CBT in routine care settings. Project Narrative: This project will compare two methods of assessing the quality of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that do not involve directly observing sessions, adherence checklists embedded in clinical notes, and rating the quality of worksheets that are completed with therapist guidance during sessions. It will also examine whether ratings of worksheets completed on a mobile app are reliable and valid quality measures. This information can inform strategies to monitor and enhance CBT quality, which can ultimately improve the quality of care and clinical outcomes.",Leveraging Routine Clinical Materials and Mobile Technology to Assess CBT Quality,9655382,R01MH112628,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Anxiety', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Familiarity', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Light', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Paper', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychotherapy', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'clinical material', 'cognitive enhancement', 'community setting', 'cost', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care economics', 'health care settings', 'health economics', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel strategies', 'predict clinical outcome', 'programs', 'routine care', 'skills', 'standard measure', 'statistics']",NIMH,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2019,651137,0.02065942565272583
"Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks Project Summary/Abstract Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), particularly carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs), are a major cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Though studies have found multiple interventions addressing MDRO colonization and transmission to be effective at reducing HAIs, implementation has lagged due to questions regarding the most efficacious combination of interventions. As healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals, long-term care facilities, or outpatient surgical centers and clinics) are part of an interconnected healthcare network, evaluation of an intervention’s impact on transmission and infection must consider the dynamics across the healthcare system. To address remaining knowledge gaps regarding the most effective combinations of intervention strategies, we will build a multi-level model that spans from individual patients to regionally interconnected healthcare facilities. The resulting framework will provide hospital administrators and infection control experts with tools for quantifying individual patient risk factors for colonization and infection and for comparing the potential effectiveness of interventions to control HAIs. The aims of the project are: (1) to develop models to estimate the underlying prevalence and incidence of CROs and predict which patients are at highest risk for colonization and infection with CROs using clinical samples collected during the normal course of care; (2) to utilize hospital-level models to quantify the combinatorial relationship between, and marginal impact of, additional interventions to reduce HAIs; and (3) to build a regional model of a healthcare system to examine the effectiveness of interventions across institutions. Models will start with the patient at the center, utilizing the rich covariate data stored in electronic medical records to develop prediction models based on advanced machine learning. These prediction models will be translatable tools that can be directly incorporated into clinical care to assist clinicians in preventing HAIs. In addition, they will form the foundation of hospital-level models that will allow for detailed examinations of the effectiveness of different combinations of interventions. Hospital-level models will then be embedded in a network of healthcare facilities that accounts for the differing incentives faced by geographically dispersed facilities with variable demographic populations. These models will directly inform CDC guidelines about MDRO prevention and aid clinicians in reducing the risk of HAIs. Project Narrative The models developed through this proposal will improve understanding of how biological factors associated with the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) impact interventions to reduce hospital-associated infections (HAIs). This will aid predictions of patients’ risk for colonization and infection, as well as improve understanding of how interventions can most effectively be combined to reduce the likelihood that patients will suffer from these high-consequence pathogens.",Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks,9730300,U01CK000536,[' '],NCEZID,"CENTER/ DISEASE DYNAMICS, ECONOM/POLICY",U01,2019,646905,0.012125122615795025
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA).

"Independent Exoskeleton-Use through Robust Stand-to-Sit Safety Project Summary/Abstract Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to create a system for the sensing and control of stand-to-sit motions of a wearable bionics suit. Currently 5.6 million people in the US have impaired mobility from a number of different causes. The primary means of mobility for many of these patients is the wheelchair as it has been for most of the last 50 years. Despite all the benefits introduced by widespread use of the wheelchair, it remains a less than ideal mobility solution. Exoskeleton suits have the potential to empower individuals with impaired mobility with an alternative to wheelchairs that allows them to stand up and walk independently within their home and community has the potential to more fully reintegrate these individuals into society while also further improving their health and quality of life. For exoskeletons to gain acceptance in every-day independent home and community use, many control and safety related functionalities still need to be addressed. Our proposal seeks to address one of the gaps in allowing for independent use of exoskeletons in the home and community, namely, functionality to transition from standing to sitting in a safe manner. The proposed work will provide exoskeleton users with the new ability to independently sit down without assistance and confidence in being able to do so without falling and risking possible injuries. It aims to significantly change the way exoskeletons work thereby facilitating their adoption into the market and directly impacting the lives of individuals with disabilities. Project Narrative Exoskeletons can provide patients with SCI, stroke, and other types of impaired mobility access to extended duration, gravity dependent ambulation that can directly combat the risks associated with physical deconditioning. There are benefits for exoskeleton-use to gain widespread acceptance in every-day, independent home and community settings.

"Drivers of Variation in Contact Networks in Long Term Care Facilities PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to improve understanding of transmission of resistant bacteria by characterizing contact networks in a national sample of approximately 25 long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Each participating LTCF will be visited twice during the course of this study for primary data collection. Healthcare professional (HCP) – resident contact networks will be ascertained in several different ways. We define contact networks as interactions between individuals that have the potential to mediate transmission. Our primary technique for estimating who contacted whom will be through self-report by health care professionals in the participating LTCFs. This approach will be compared to use of information about staff assignments, unit sub-divisions, and staff-resident ratios to make inferences about contact patterns. In addition, we will use direct observation to collect information about room entry rates and behaviors, such as hand hygiene, that influence whether an interaction results in acquisition. Facility and resident assessments will also be performed through chart review and survey. Resident level data will include presence of devices, infection status, antibiotic use, wound care, and comorbidities. In one to two of the participating facilities, we will use two new technologies to capture more detailed data on contacts within LTCFs. First, we will use a badge-based-sensor network to construct networks on the basis of personal proximity. This approach will allow us to examine how healthcare professionals and residents move within units of LTCFs and to analyze sequences of close contacts. However, this technology may not be sufficient to determine if the healthcare professional touched the patient. Thus, in a smaller number of rooms, we will use a second technological strategy, computer vision and depth sensing. This approach makes it feasible to collect highly granular data on behaviors such as use of gowns, gloves, and masks. Our analytical models will focus on dependencies between contact network structure, facility characteristics, and individual resident and HCP attributes. We will determine whether the number of unique contacts per individual are statistically dissimilar for different types of residents and HCPs. Alternative ways to derive contact networks will be compared with respect to overlap and completeness. Temporal models will also be used to examine dynamic changes in networks over time. Our hypothesis is that the structure of contact networks will vary according to the clinical services offered by LTCFs and that these structural properties will have significant implications for transmission and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our study will examine patterns of contacts between healthcare professionals and residents in a national sample of long term care facilities. Contact networks have been a major focus of epidemiological studies of infection transmission, but much more work has been done in community populations than in healthcare settings. Our goal is to advance understanding how diseases can spread within long term care facilities and to enhance our ability to evaluate the effectiveness of different infection control interventions.",Drivers of Variation in Contact Networks in Long Term Care Facilities,9753063,U01CK000555,[' '],NCEZID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2019,720485,0.0108667104632885
"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems.

"Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications Abstract Our objective in this project is to employ population level pharmacy data and delivery of nudges via cell phone text messaging and artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems (HCS): University of Colorado Health System (UCHealth), VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System (VA), and Denver Health Medical Center (DH). We will identify patients with chronic cardiovascular (CV) conditions taking medications to treat hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diabetes and/or hyperlipidemia. We will leverage pharmacy refill data to identify episodes of non-adherence through gaps in medication refills and randomize individuals to 1 of 4 study arms when they have a first refill gap: 1) usual care; 2) generic text message reminder; 3) tailored and engaging text messages optimized to facilitate behavior change; or 4) optimized text messages plus a pre- programmed AI interactive chat bot designed to support identification and resolution of barriers to medication refill and adherence. In the UG3 phase (year 1), we will develop and program a theoretically informed technology-based (a) text message library and (b) chat bot content library using multiple and iterative N of 1 within subject studies to optimize content for a range of diverse patients. These outcomes will inform a pilot intervention to demonstrate feasibility of delivering the intervention and preliminary effects in all 3 HCS. We will also engage patient, provider and health systems stakeholders in designing, refining, and implementing the pilot intervention. In the UH3 phase (years 2-5), we will conduct a pragmatic patient-level randomized intervention across 3 HCS to improve adherence to chronic CV medications. We will evaluate the intervention using a mixed methods approach and apply the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. In addition, we will assess the context and implementation processes to inform local tailoring, adaptations and modifications, and eventual expansion of the intervention. Project Narrative Given the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases that require ongoing treatment with medications, the problem of medication non-adherence is unlikely to go away and will grow. This study will employ population level pharmacy data to identify non-adherent patients and utilize ubiquitous cell phone technology to send them tailored, engaging and motivating text messages and text message based chat through an artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve cardiac medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems. This study will advance medication adherence research and the intervention could be applied to multiple clinical conditions requiring medications for long term treatment and other NIH institutes.!",Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications,9750927,UH3HL144163,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Integrated Delivery of Health Care', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Libraries', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patient Noncompliance', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Self Management', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'blood pressure regulation', 'chatbot', 'copayment', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'financial incentive', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'individual response', 'medication compliance', 'medication nonadherence', 'mortality', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'safety net', 'secondary outcome', 'smoking cessation', 'theories', 'treatment as usual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,UH3,2019,1455863,0.019082809079106235
"Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management Project Summary/Abstract Advanced Medical Electronics Corporation and our partners propose to develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) system for persons with dementia (PWD),(mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, or other dementias), who are living in assisted living facilities. The proposed system uses Augmented Intelligence (AI) to communicate with the PWD in natural language. The system's goals are three-fold. First, the system helps PWD transition from living in their homes to ALFs by fostering relationships and conveying schedules. Second, the system enables PWD to age in place by addressing the challenges that often lead to an escalation of care (i.e., nursing homes). Third, the system engages PWD via activities such as storytelling and simple games. We will integrate the proposed SAR system with current assistive technology, which is based on the evidence from tested, personalized psychosocial approaches to deliver non-drug intervention to improve everyday behavior, function, and quality of life in PWD. A strong multi-disciplinary team of engineers, academic experts in SAR and PWD, and a commercialization partner has been assembled to achieve these goals. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is one of the costliest chronic diseases affecting an estimated 5.3 million Americans at a cost of $236 billion. Social assistive robots can be used to lessen levels of depression, loneliness, grief, fear, and frustration as dementia progresses improving mental health and quality of life. In addition to improved quality of life, persons with dementia may be able to extend the amount of time in assisted living before being forced to a much costlier higher level of care such as a nursing home.",Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management,10012469,R44AG058337,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communication', 'Companions', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fostering', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frustration', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Health', 'Hobbies', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information and Media', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Loneliness', 'Medical Electronics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Schedule', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Concepts', 'Social Development', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'body language', 'cognitive computing', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'non-drug', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'robot interface', 'social', 'social assistive robot', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIA,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2019,1908341,-0.00874277631306233
"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This eMERGE III proposal builds on past discoveries and research designed to translate genomic advances into clinical care involving clinicians, patients and families. This phase focuses on traits associated with preventable health concerns: colon cancer, triglycerides, and immunity. We address optimal methods to share information across families and whether other information found by genomic tests impact the care, health, and medical costs of individuals.","The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III",9894990,U01HG008657,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amendment', 'American', 'Asians', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Community Practice', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Digital Libraries', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Immunity', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Other Genetics', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Social Impacts', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Triglycerides', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'economic outcome', 'education resources', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'online resource', 'outreach', 'patient portal', 'polyposis', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2019,707923,0.005945089794237677
"Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout Gout is a highly prevalent, painful inflammatory arthritis, caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Gout flares cause impaired quality of life and physical function, leading to lost work days, disability, high healthcare costs. Patients with gout are also known to be at an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), kidney disease, and mortality. Previous studies suggest a potential beneficial effect of urate-lowering therapy on the risk of CVD and renal function. Over the past decade, the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid (SUA) level below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, based on the upper limit of water solubility of uric acid under normal physiologic circumstances. However, the 2016 American College of Physicians (ACP)’ guidelines for gout management recommend use of urate-lowering therapy but support a ‘treat-to-avoid symptoms’ strategy without monitoring SUA rather than the TTT strategy because of ‘inconclusive’ evidence in the literature. Such discrepancies in treatment guidelines from various societies urge the need for comparative effectiveness research of the treatment strategies for gout.  Rigorous epidemiologic studies utilizing high-quality observational data from electronic health records (EHR) or insurance claims databases can be an important tool for comparative effectiveness research. The primary objective of this 3-year proposal is to provide high-quality, timely evidence on the comparative effectiveness of two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of gout. We will pursue this objective by utilizing the linked Partners’ EHR-Medicare database (2007-2016); this linked database includes all patients aged ≥65 years enrolled in Medicare Parts A/B/D who had ≥1 encounter at one of the Partners Healthcare hospitals. We will have longitudinal, clinically important data on patients’ demographics, body mass index, visit notes, laboratory results including SUA and serum creatinine, as well as all Medicare claims for inpatient and outpatient visits, procedures, and prescription drugs. The two specific aims of this 3-year proposal are: 1) to examine the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of gout flares versus usual care and 2) to assess the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of kidney disease and CVD versus usual care.  Given the substantial prevalence of gout, the suboptimal management of gout and lack of comparative trial of different treatment strategies, this proposed study will make an immediate, important contribution to the management of gout in clinical practice. This work will not only investigate the effects of different treatment strategies on gout flares but also on common comorbidities in patients with gout such as kidney and CVD. Furthermore, this proposed study will advance understanding of how to improve ascertainment of dynamic outcomes and control for time-varying confounding by utilizing sophisticated and innovative epidemiologic as well as bioinformatics methods in a large EHR database linked with Medicare claims. Narrative Gout is a common, painful inflammatory arthritis caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat, are the mainstay of urate-lowering treatment for gout. While rheumatology societies recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, there is currently no clinical data whether TTT approach is better than urate- lowering therapy but no regular monitoring of uric acid levels (i.e., usual care); therefore, this 3-year research proposal examines the comparative effectiveness of the two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of chronic gout in a real-world setting.",Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout,9659038,R01AR073314,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allopurinol', 'American', 'American College of Physicians', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'European', 'Flare', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Hyperuricemia', 'Impairment', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Inpatients', 'Joints', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Research Proposals', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urate', 'Uric Acid', 'Visit', 'Work', 'active comparator', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative trial', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'effectiveness research', 'efficacy study', 'electronic data', 'epidemiology study', 'febuxostat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'population based', 'rheumatologist', 'routine care', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'water solubility', 'xanthine oxidase inhibitor']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,492573,-0.004124935361708195
"Novel Methods for Evaluation and Implementation of Behavioral Intervention Technologies for Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is projected to be a leading cause of burden of disease globally and in the United States. In the United States, in 2012 alone, an estimated 16 million adults aged 18 or older (7% of all adults) had at least one major depressive episode. While psychological treatments are effective at treating depression, the high prevalence of MDD makes it impossible to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) use technologies such as mobile phones to support behavior change to improve mental health, and have been shown to have similar effects to psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. With the growing number of mobile phone users, BIT is a viable and promising option for delivering psychotherapy. On the other hand, the current evaluation framework of new interventions is not adequate for evaluating and implementing BITs, because of the rapidly evolving BIT landscape and the complexity of the interventions. This research aims to develop and validate novel concepts and evaluation framework to address these two challenges in the dissemination and implementation of BITs in MDD patients in pragmatic settings. We plan to achieve this research goal in four steps. First, we will develop a new statistical design, called open-ended adaptive randomization (OAR) procedure, which will enable us to continuously evaluate BITs that enter and leave a care delivery system. The OAR also aims to improve quality of care given to the participating patients, by sequentially allocating patients away from inferior BITs based on the interim evidence during deployment. Second, we will develop a data analytical technique, called regularized Q-learning, which will enable us to perform variable selection in high-dimensional settings and retain only the important predictors of health outcomes in the learning model. While the original Q-learning is a cutting-edge technique originating from the computer science literature, the research will extend its capability to handle high-dimensional data and enrich the learning model by incorporating regularized regression. Third, we will prepare for the next implementation phase of the proposed methods, by calibrating the methods with computer simulations, creating an initial knowledge base by analyzing data from current randomized clinical trials, identifying partnerships with healthcare providers and app curation plaftorms. Fourth, we will advocate for the general implementation of the proposed methods by producing publications, building cognitive computing systems, and tracking the source of citation and adoption of the published results by the broader health research community. Our long-term goal is to enhance our capability of deploying complex interventions such as BITs to depressed patients in a personalized and evidence-based manner throughout the healthcare system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common, and imposes a high societal cost in terms of quality of life, work productivity, functional status, morbidity and mortality. The national healthcare system will not be able to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. With the growing number of smartphone use, behavioral intervention technologies have become a viable and scalable option to deliver psychotherapy to the population. This research proposes novel evaluation and implementation concepts and methods that aim to extend our capacity to adopt these technologies in an evidence-based manner.",Novel Methods for Evaluation and Implementation of Behavioral Intervention Technologies for Depression,9620626,R01MH109496,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Evidence based practice', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Inferior', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Science', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'burden of illness', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'cognitive computing', 'computer science', 'depressed patient', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'efficacy study', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'functional status', 'health goals', 'high dimensionality', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'preference', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research data dissemination', 'sensor', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'smartphone Application', 'societal costs', 'statistics', 'technology development']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,396099,-0.010649766252945987
"Avoidable Acute Care Use among Patients with Lupus PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Candace Feldman is an Instructor in Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy and the Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). Dr. Feldman has a longstanding passion to understand and reduce disparities in rheumatic diseases. Her research focuses on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in prevalence, access and outcomes among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Her 14 peer-reviewed original publications, 8 first author, and 2 early career development grants exemplify her track record and her commitment to this field. She holds a MPH degree and is pursuing a doctorate in social epidemiology from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her immediate goals are to learn and apply advanced health services research and qualitative methods to understand SLE-related avoidable acute care use to inform a future intervention. She will be guided by Dr. Costenbader, an established SLE epidemiologist, and an expert mentoring team. Dr. Feldman strives to apply rigorous methods to redesign healthcare delivery for vulnerable rheumatology patients. Environment: Dr. Feldman’s Division Chief ensures that >75% of her time will be protected for research and career development for the 5-year duration of this K23 award. She has financial support to supplement her salary and project-related expenses from the Division, the SCS, and her primary mentor’s funding. The BWH Lupus Center, co-directed by Dr. Costenbader, is the largest in New England. The research infrastructure established as part of the Center will enable Dr. Feldman to recruit patients. In addition, the SCS has extensive research infrastructure, which will continue to support her work. Dr. Feldman has access to Medicaid data under Dr. Costenbader’s Data Use Agreement with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and to Partners HealthCare electronic health records linked to claims data through the explicit support of Population Health Management. For her training, she will have access to courses and mentorship at HSPH, where she is a doctoral student, and through Harvard Medical School and the Harvard Catalyst Program. Research: Dr. Feldman will rigorously define SLE-related conditions that may result in avoidable acute care use (e.g. emergency department visits and hospitalizations). She will then examine rates and predictors of potentially avoidable use, and associated mortality and costs in two large, diverse datasets. She will learn and apply qualitative methods, including Photovoice, which will empower SLE patients to photograph their homes and communities, to explore the contribution of social determinants to avoidable care use. Dr. Feldman will hold focus groups of SLE patients, providers and administrators to design a rheumatology-based intervention to improve healthcare delivery for these high-utilizing, vulnerable SLE patients. Dr. Feldman will develop skills in rigorous mixed methods research. This project, and the training Dr. Feldman will gain, will position her for a R01 and for a career as an independent social epidemiology and patient-oriented investigator in rheumatology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lupus is a complex autoimmune disease, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and resulting in high acute care use, much of which could be prevented if patients had consistent access to high-quality outpatient care. There is a need to define and understand lupus-specific avoidable acute care use (emergency department visits and hospitalizations) and to identify those patients at highest risk. This study will inform the design of interventions aimed at optimizing outpatient care, preventing adverse outcomes, and reducing disparities among patients with complex, subspecialty-managed diseases.",Avoidable Acute Care Use among Patients with Lupus,9663874,K23AR071500,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Administrator', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cost Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delphi Technique', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Financial Support', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lupus', 'Mediating', 'Medicaid', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Social support', 'Structural Models', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care costs', 'career', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'cost', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'doctoral student', 'ethnic minority population', 'health care delivery', 'health management', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'instructor', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'medical schools', 'medication nonadherence', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient subsets', 'population health', 'prevent', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'research and development', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'therapy design']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2019,178195,0.029555062286563412
"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9747912,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outcomes and Health Services Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'risk prediction model', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2019,168896,0.008534100407483463
"Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing Project Summary  Safety net providers treat a substantial share of socioeconomically vulnerable patients in their communities, but struggle to provide timely access to high quality specialty care for their patients. Delayed access to specialty care is associated with worse health outcomes and potentially contributes to health disparities across socioeconomic groups. Given their limited resources, safety net providers must seek creative approaches to improve specialty access. However, to choose what programs to implement, safety net providers need to understand the specialty care needs of their populations. Fortunately, the adoption of eConsult systems by safety net providers across the US provides a valuable opportunity to systematically measure patterns of specialty care referrals for minority, underserved populations.  In this project, we propose using state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to help safety net providers extract actionable, population wide data from their electronic consultation systems. We will do this in partnership with three of the most prominent safety net health systems in the US in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Using specialty request databases from our collaborators, we will build NLP systems to automatically classify specialty requests along two dimensions: the “clinical issue” motivating the request (e.g., chest pain), and the “question type” (e.g., request for a procedure, help with medication management). This automated classification of electronic specialty requests can enable identification of promising targets for interventions to improve specialty access and quality of care.  After developing these NLP systems, we will analyze >1 million specialty requests to describe trends in how safety net patients are referred to specialists and examine variation in referral patterns by clinic and individual provider. The goal is to identify the most impactful opportunities to improve specialty access and quality. For example, a high rate of referrals for esophageal reflux, which most PCPs can treat on their own with specialist guidance, could lead to new treatment algorithms, potentially reducing the need for these requests and improving access for other patients.  This proposal is a “high-risk high-reward” project that creates new research tools to identify and evaluate data-driven interventions to improve specialty care delivery for underserved populations. Project Narrative Access to timely, high-quality specialty care is a fundamental component of a well-functioning health system, yet safety net health care providers face persistent challenges delivering such care. Quality improvement efforts to improve specialty access have been thwarted in part because safety net providers lack the data to understand a basic question – why patients are referred for specialty care. Taking advantage of the growing use of electronic specialty referral systems by safety net providers, we propose using natural language processing to conduct automated analysis and classification of specialty requests in safety net populations, which will enable the design of targeted interventions to improve specialty care access and delivery.",Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing,9600732,R21MD012693,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Chest Pain', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consultations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical center', 'Medication Management', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Public Hospitals', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Telemedicine', 'Text', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Triage', 'Underserved Population', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'care delivery', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'ethnic minority population', 'follow-up', 'health disparity', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'medically underserved', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'safety net', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'trend', 'two-dimensional']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,278902,0.0018507210375261207
"Leveraging advanced clinical phenotyping to enhance problem lists and support value-based healthcare Project Summary With newly available electronic health data and a massive increase in processing power, data-driven personalized medicine is just now becoming possible.1 However, advances to improve health care are inherently limited by data quality. One of the most used sources of data, the patient problem list, is also the greatest source of data inaccuracy. According to recent studies, the patient problem list is often less than 50% accurate in documenting the most critical conditions.2 3 4 5 These errors exacerbate inefficiencies throughout the American health care system from care delivery to quality improvement. Primary care physicians rely on problem lists to develop transitional treatment plans for the 68 million Americans who change providers every year. Errors related to care transitions harm more than 1.5 million people each year in the United States, costing the nation an estimated $3.5 billion annually.6 Population health efforts, a cornerstone of value-based healthcare, rely on problem lists to determine risk levels and deployment of resources. These efforts cannot succeed if the source data produce faulty results. This application seeks to enable better individual patient care, enhanced population health management, and effective downstream analytics by building an automated problem list builder, which provides an accurate and granular account of the patient’s medical conditions. If the program is successful, one of the greatest technical risks in value-based healthcare will be addressed. Phase I exceeded success criteria in proving feasibility of core modules in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence. Based on Phase I success, implementation pathways are demonstrated through pilots with one of the largest US healthcare systems and one of the largest global biotechnology firms. The team is comprised of commercial and academic leaders in the field of NLP-based products applied to value-based healthcare. Project Narrative VMT proposes to use advanced semantic technologies and artificial intelligence to enhance the individualized patient problem list, which frequently has 50% or lower accuracy for common conditions such as cancer, smoking, and heart failure. 1 2 3 The problem list represents source data in care delivery, population health, shared-risk contracting, and research.

"Strengthening Families Program Online Web Version for Teens ABSTRACT  This SBIR Phase I project uses formative evaluation strategies to develop, test, refine, and evaluate an alpha prototype of the 10-session, evidence-based Strengthening Families Program 7-17 and SFP Home-Use DVD as a web-assisted platform. The Specific Aim of the new “SFP Online!” program is to increase family accessibility and engagement by transitioning from costly group-based, facilitator-led, parenting and family skills training to low cost web-delivery. SFP draws heavily on theories that integrate family dynamics (monitoring, bonding, and communication), parenting skills, youth drug etiology (risk and protective factors), and social learning. Substantial empirical evidence from 14 RCTs with diverse families and locations shows that SFP works with large program effect sizes to reduce behavioral health risks and substance abuse. Phase I will determine whether the adapted online version can reproduce outcomes of the facilitator-led family group version with minimal loss of fidelity, efficacy, and vitality. Five integrated formative evaluation strategies involving 380 participants including ten focus groups with potential end users (100 parents and 100 youth) from SFP providers nationwide will explore adaptations, usability, feasibility and barriers to use. Consumer preference surveys tapping both recent SFP DVD users and agency service providers will explore factors that may mitigate or enhance delivery of SFP Online. This approach based on input from both parents and youth and providers will ensure that SFP Online is culturally and developmentally appropriate. We will also rely on key informant interviews with 50 family service providers and community stakeholders to address barriers to implementation and the eventual integration of SFP Online into existing prevention and treatment strategies. We will include interviews with prevention scientists and e-learning experts to review the architectural plan and ensure fidelity to current prevention and technology initiatives. These consumer surveys will inform a product specification plan supporting a “wireframe technology” to make SFP Online a viable web-assisted program. To create the alpha prototype in Phase I SFP LLC will collaborate with 3C Institute, a leading software development company with extensive expertise building interactive multimedia technology for behavioral health interventions. 3C Institute will employ its proprietary Dynamic e-Learning Platform (DeLP), a customizable technology that integrates the latest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. LARS Research Institute, a leading behavioral technology transfer company will assist in the evaluation of the program’s adherence to the standards of evidence. We will also draw on extensive community support based on 30 years of administering SFP products to family service agencies nationwide and other CBOs that emphasize parent training, and drug and child maltreatment prevention. The proposed formative evaluation strategies and collaboration with ten national prevention and e-learning experts should ensure timely and successful completion of the Phase I research activities and produce an effortless transition to the Phase II build-and-test stage. Project Narrative – SFP Online! This Phase I SBIR study seeks to adapt the Strengthening Families Program, an evidence-based facilitator-led family skills training and youth drug prevention program with family classes and entertaining video clips, to a web-based platform. Providing parenting training and drug prevention via the web offers tremendous cost savings and provides an efficient conduit for mass dissemination.

"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients. This mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research will develop and test methods to surmount these three barriers in the context of a multifaceted training program that will make the Principal Investigator a more effective mentor and team leader.",Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure,9582115,K24HL143289,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advance Directives', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'career', 'clinical infrastructure', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'financial incentive', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized approach', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'student mentoring', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K24,2018,120139,0.002037969108293079
"Identifying palliative care needs among hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease PROJECT SUMMARY Millions of Americans with COPD experience burdensome symptoms, reduced quality of life, and undesirable end-of-life care. Increasing palliative care for this vulnerable population is widely advocated to improve these important patient-centered outcomes. Yet patients with COPD rarely receive palliative care due, in part, to difficulties identifying which patients have unmet palliative care needs and palliative care workforce shortages. The proposed study's core objective is to address the national priority of improving palliative care for patients with COPD by developing an efficient, innovative, and patient-centered method to identify those with unmet palliative care needs. Specifically, the candidate seeks to (1) assess patients with COPD to determine their palliative care needs; (2) develop and validate an electronic health record-based classification model for each domain of palliative care needs; and (3) evaluate the relationship between the probability of having unmet palliative care needs and patient-centered clinical outcomes. The study will involve an in-person cross- sectional survey of 432 hospitalized patients with COPD of any stage. Participants will complete a validated survey to capture a wide variety of palliative care needs, which will be supplemented with expert chart review to identify patients with needs in any of three clinically relevant and actionable domains. These cases will be used as the patient-reported reference standard for development and validation of domain-specific classification models leveraging natural language processing of unstructured clinical text in electronic health records and machine learning methods. Finally, a large, multicenter retrospective cohort study will evaluate the associations between different probabilities of having unmet palliative care needs and several clinical outcomes important to patients, caregivers, and hospitals. This will enable the identification of thresholds of probabilities of unmet needs above which COPD patients' risks of undesirable clinical outcomes increase. Such patients will then be targeted for enrollment in future trials testing interventions to improve these outcomes. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, an F32-supported post-doctoral fellowship, and a career development award from the National Palliative Care Research Center, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. The candidate's rigorous training plan, focused on obtaining advanced skills in multisite prospective research, patient-centered outcomes research, and advanced bioinformatics methods will allow her to submit successful R01 or PCORI applications testing interventions directly informed by the results of this work. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a supportive environment for her to develop an independent research career focused on improving the uptake and effectiveness of palliative care for patients with COPD and other cardiopulmonary diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with COPD experience burdensome symptoms, reduced quality of life, and low quality end-of-life care. Palliative care may improve such outcomes, yet resources are strained and it is difficult to identify which patients are most in need.

"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,9504868,K08DE027720,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Health Services', 'Dentists', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural experiment', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'evidence base', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'payment', 'population health', 'population survey', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'relative effectiveness']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2018,131517,0.026771433180609715
"A Comprehensive Fall Prevention System for Memory Care: Final Feasibility and Randomized Controlled Study Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the activities of daily living. Fall safety systems show the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of showing caregivers how falls occur. Our goal is to extend the impacts of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with off-the- shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL, who can monitor several facilities at a time, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the facilities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection (as opposed to hours after, when the next scheduled visit to the room of the patient happens). Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) reviews the fall videos to make recommendations on how to re-organize the patient space (intervention), to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The present Fast Track NIH SBIR project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 11 memory care facilities, recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots, which we leverage:  · Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility  from the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led  to clinical benefits including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of an Occupational  Therapist (OT) to re-organize patient space. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11 facilities,  totaling 100 patients monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4 (ongoing): We demonstrated the ability to perform online (real-time) fall detection, with  real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions, which  provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities, and confirmed the decrease of the  number of falls, with the 100 patients. In this project, we will develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real- time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective.

"Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist committed to improving the quality of patient-oriented research for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Worldwide, millions of patients develop ARF annually. In the U.S., nearly one million patients with ARF require mechanical ventilation annually, accounting for a quarter of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As improvements in ICU care reduce such patients’ in-hospital mortality rates, attention has shifted to the challenges ARF survivors face in regaining their prior cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning. However, there is a key barrier for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing new interventions to improve ARF survivorship – that is, the current lack of an endpoint that (1) captures long-term patient dispositions, (2) incorporates patient preferences and perspectives, and (3) is able to be analyzed without concern for statistical biases. The overarching goal of this research is to support clinical innovation by developing new approaches to measure and report long-term patient-centered outcomes that overcome the methodological barriers currently limiting ARF RCTs. The applicant will accomplish his goals under the mentorship of established researchers in critical care, patient-centered outcomes research, statistics, and informatics to assure his transition to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist. First, the applicant will use an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit and integrate ARF survivors’ and their caregivers’ perspectives into a new patient-centered, long-term composite outcome measure (K99 phase). During the R00 phase, the applicant will recruit ARF survivors to participate in a prospective cohort, and follow these patients to describe the burden of ARF survivorship over 1-year using the new endpoint developed during the K99 phase. This endeavor will also provide key data that will facilitate sample size calculations in future ARF RCTs. Data from this cohort will additionally be used to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm to predict risks for adverse long-term outcomes among ARF patients early in their ICU stays. Thus, this K99/R00 will augment ARF research by establishing a new outcome measure anchored in patient perspectives, improving the understanding and clinical prognostication of post-ICU morbidity following ARF, and facilitate the efficiency and clinical relevance of future ARF RCTs by enabling measurement of patients’ baseline risks for different outcomes. Concurrently, the didactic work, individual study, and hands-on learning in mixed-methods research, natural language processing, and predictive analytics will fill key training gaps for the applicant, thereby positioning him for a successful, independently-funded research career advancing the science of outcomes measurement and analysis for ARF RCTs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized trials testing strategies to improve long-term outcomes for survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) are hampered by the lack of valid, patient-centered endpoints. Using interviews with ARF survivors and their caregivers, statistical simulation, consensus building among stakeholders, and a prospective cohort study, the applicant will develop, describe the epidemiology of, and predict a new patient-oriented outcome that will support trials of innovative approaches to improve ARF survivorship outcomes.","Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure",9505095,K99HL141678,"['Accounting', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rogaine', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'hands-on learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'residence', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'survivorship', 'tenure track']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2018,105743,0.007854118981149301
"Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor Summary The principal goal of this proposal is to increase the accuracy and precision of a low-cost autorefraction device called the QuickSee, in order to improve access to refractive eye care for underserved populations. Poor vision due to a lack of eyeglasses is highly prevalent in low-resource settings throughout the world and significantly reduces quality of life, education, and productivity. The existing QuickSee only extracts the lower- order aberration information contained within a wavefront profile of the eye, to roughly estimate an eyeglass prescription. This proposal will further improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device by exploiting both the lower- and higher-order aberrations contained within the complete wavefront. To realize this goal, we will enroll 300 subjects (600 eyes) in Baltimore, MD, and will obtain subjective refraction and visual acuity (VA) measurements and will use machine learning on this large dataset of wavefront profiles to optimize the wavefront-to-refraction algorithm of the QuickSee device. The main output of this project will be a robust and improved-accuracy next-generation QuickSee device that will increase efficiency of and decrease the training requirements of eye care professionals, and potentially dispense refractive correction that provides similar or better VA than correction from an eye care professional. Successful completion of this work will be an important step towards dramatically improving eyeglass accessibility for health disparity populations in the USA and internationally in low-resource settings. Upon completion of this proposal, we will apply for a Phase II award proposing to work with Wilmer Eye Institute research faculty to assess widespread deployment of the next-generation QuickSee with minimally-trained personnel in order to accurately and reliably provide thousands of pairs of low-cost corrective eyeglasses to underserved communities. Project Narrative This project proposal seeks to develop a novel technology that will disruptively increase the accessibility of refractive eye care for health disparity populations in low-resource settings. Specifically, sophisticated algorithms will be developed that improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device so that it can improve the efficiency of and reduce the training barriers for eye care professionals, and potentially provide refractive correction without the need for refinement by a trained eye care professional. Our goal is to develop a low- cost, easy-to-use, scalable solution to increase accessibility to vision correction globally.","Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor",9711194,R43EB024299,"['Algorithms', 'Award', 'Baltimore', 'Brazil', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Educational Status', 'Enrollment', 'Eye', 'Eyeglasses', 'Feedback', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guatemala', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'India', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Machine Learning', 'Mali', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Optometrist', 'Output', 'Patient Schedules', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Pupil', 'Quality of life', 'Refractive Errors', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual Acuity', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'faculty research', 'health care disparity', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'lens', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'success', 'vector']",NIBIB,"PLENOPTIKA, INC.",R43,2018,99914,0.004665077303136642
"Detecting and Monitoring Tardive Dyskinesia to Improve Patient Outcomes Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a common debilitating side effect of antipsychotic use. Characterized most notably by involuntary facial movements such as grimacing, involuntary lip, mouth, and tongue movements, and eye blinking, TD is difficult to treat and potentially irreversible. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are acutely aware of the impairment and disability experienced by patients who develop TD. Early detection of TD is critical so that appropriate interventions can be instituted. Unfortunately, despite professionals’ best efforts, it is often too late in the process and the involuntary movements are permanent. Antipsychotic prescriptions exceeded 50 million in 2011 and the reported incidence of TD is between 13% and 24%. Risk grows with advancing age, off-label uses, and chronic exposure to antipsychotics. Therefore, prevention and early detection are key to managing TD. However, current methods for monitoring patients require observation of patients at infrequent in-person visits or self-reporting by vigilant patients and their families. Therefore strong market potential exists for an automated detection system. This Phase I project proposes to leverage existing telepsychiatry and video interview data gathering technologies available commercially to efficiently collect and analyze one hundred ten (110) 5-minute video interviews with individuals taking anti-psychotic medications. Half of the interviews will be with individuals living with diagnosed TD and the other without a diagnosis of TD. The participants in the study will be recruited to ensure an equal distribution of females and males as well as an ethnically and racially representative sample. The proposed data gathering strategy will provide the source material necessary to create a powerful supervised machine learning derived video and audio analysis tool to detect TD. The detection tool will be created using 80% of the collected video data as a training set and validated on the remaining 20% reserved as the control set. Based on industry experience with other supervised machine learning training sets and the amount of data to be collected, we set a goal of a 90% success rate in identifying TD positive and TD negative participants in the control set. Once the detection tool is complete the project will conclude by incorporating access to the tool into an existing smartphone app, iRxReminder, that is used for data gathering and monitoring of medication adherence. The iRxReminder system links patients directly to researchers’ and healthcare professionals’ electronic records. The modified app will be tested in the laboratory to ensure the interface can be easily used. The addendum request includes additional funding to participate in the I-Corp training. Participants in the training will include CEO and PI/PD Anthony Sterns PhD, C-level executive Fred Pollock serving as iRxReminder’s CBO, and Industry Expert Fred Ma, MD PhD, who serves as iRxReminder’s regulatory consultant. In Phase II the iRxReminder system will be validated for use in supporting the self-management and symptom monitoring of medication taking by individuals living with chronic mental illnesses. Once feasibility is established, we propose a year-long RCT where participants will be monitored for early detection of TD along with goals for high adherence, improved control of symptoms and side effects, and more aggressive and frequent treatment responses by the healthcare team. A recent study reported that TD rates among newly treated elderly ranged from 7.2% for those taking Risperidone to 11.1% for those taking olanzapine after 2 years of treatment. Earlier meta-analyses estimate TD frequency in women to be 26.6% and in men 21.6%. Ethnically Chinese and Malaysian mental health patients were studied in Singapore and patients taking anti-psychotic medications were found to have TD in 40% and 29% of cases respectively. Regardless of prevalence, TD is a threat to patient adherence and quality of life. TD only remits in a minority of cases and can be permanent. With 50 million prescriptions for anti-psychotics written annually, more than 10 million persons living with a chronic mental illness are at risk of developing TD. There are likely over 6 million patients living with TD and the number of patients with TD is expected to grow with the aging population and increasing off- label use of antipsychotics.!",Detecting and Monitoring Tardive Dyskinesia to Improve Patient Outcomes,9660614,R43MH114763,"['Acute', 'Addendum', 'Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Awareness', 'Blinking', 'Chinese People', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Involuntary Movements', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaysian', 'Medical Care Team', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient observation', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychiatrist', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risperidone', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Singapore', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tardive Dyskinesia', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'aging population', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'disability', 'experience', 'improved', 'male', 'medication compliance', 'men', 'olanzapine', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'severe mental illness', 'smartphone Application', 'success', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"CREATIVE ACTION, LLC",R43,2018,50000,0.0037706479216741166
"Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management Abstract  The study will develop more accurate, computational predictive models and a novel automatic explanation function to better identify patients likely to benefit most from care management. For many chronic diseases, a small portion of patients with high vulnerabilities, severe disease, or great barriers to care consume most healthcare resources and costs. To improve outcomes and resource use, many healthcare systems use predictive models to prospectively identify high-risk patients and enroll them in care management to implement tailored care plans. For maximal benefit from costly care management with limited service capacity, only patients at the highest risk should be enrolled. But, current patient identification approaches have two limitations: 1) Low prediction accuracy causes misclassification, wasted costs, and suboptimal care. If an existing model  were used for care management allocation, enrollment would miss >50% of those who would benefit most  but include others unlikely to benefit. A healthcare system often has insufficient data for model training and  incomplete data on many patients. A typical model uses only a few risk factors for adverse outcomes, despite  many being known. Also, many predictive variables on patient and system characteristics are not found yet. 2) No explanation of the reasons for a prediction causes poor adoption of the prediction and busy care  managers to spend extra time and miss suitable interventions. Care managers need to understand why a  patient is predicted to be at high risk before allocating to care management and forming a tailored care plan.  Existing models rarely give such explanation, forcing care managers to do detailed patient chart reviews.  To address the limitations and optimize care management for more high-risk patients to receive appropriate care, the study will: a) improve accuracy of computationally identifying high-risk patients and assess potential impact on outcomes; b) automate explanation of computational prediction results and assess impact on model accuracy and outcomes; c) assess automatic explanations' impact on care managers' acceptance of the predictions and perceived care plan quality. The use case will be asthma that affects 9% of Americans and incurs 439,000 hospitalizations, 1.8 million emergency room visits, and $56 billion in cost annually. Asthma experts and computer scientists will use data from three leading healthcare systems; a novel, model-based transfer learning technique needing no other system's raw data; a novel, pattern-based automatic explanation technique that also improves model generalizability and accuracy; a new data source PreManage to make patient data more complete; and novel features on patient and system characteristics. These techniques can advance clinical machine learning for various applications, improve patient identification, and help form tailored care plans. Focus groups will be conducted with clinicians to explore generalizing the techniques to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and heart diseases, on whom care management is also needed. The results will potentially transform care management for better outcomes and more efficient resource use. Narrative  Care management is widely used in managing asthma patients. The proposed new techniques will boost the performance of patient identification and care plan development for care management, leading to improved clinical outcomes and more efficient healthcare resource use.",Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management,9567692,R01HL142503,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Air', 'American', 'Asthma', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drops', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weather', 'adverse outcome', 'asthmatic patient', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'care costs', 'computer science', 'cost', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'simulation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,883091,0.024341287913115656
"Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases PROJECT SUMMARY The over-arching aim of this research is to: improve understanding of the patterns of health care utilization and associated costs of physical elder abuse victims to improve early identification and intervention and to inform policy. In our prior research, supported by an NIA GEMSSTAR and Beeson grant to PI Dr. Rosen, we leveraged unique partnerships with prosecutors’ offices to comprehensively examine legal case files from more than 200 victims in two large metropolitan areas, representing the largest retrospective series of legally adjudicated physical elder abuse cases ever examined. For the proposed study, we plan to link these cases, for which we have done extensive clinical analysis, to Medicare claims data. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) To use Medicare claims to describe rates and patterns of health care utilization of victims before and after detection, with a focus on potentially missed opportunities by health professionals to identify abuse and differences based on victim characteristics, (2) To compare rates and patterns of ED visits and hospitalizations of physical elder abuse victims to control groups selected algorithmically from Medicare claims data, and (3) To compare patterns of health care utilization other than EDs/hospitals between victims and controls. The proposed research will provide important insight into the patterns of health care utilization for physical elder abuse victims, focusing on whether missed opportunities exist and suggestive patterns emerge. We plan to employ sophisticated machine learning approaches to increase our ability to identify patterns suggestive of physical elder abuse exposure. This will inform strategies for identification and intervention by health care providers, and knowledge gleaned will support the future development of a health informatics tool to identify potential victims. Findings on associated costs will help define the scope and impact of physical elder abuse. This innovative approach leverages existing data gathered with NIA support and extrapolates from successful research approaches in child abuse and intimate partner violence while expanding on them. As no additional subjects will be prospectively enrolled as part of this research, we avoid many of the ethical concerns typical in elder mistreatment work. Our multi-disciplinary team of experts in elder abuse, child abuse and neglect, intimate partner violence, and emergency medicine as well as specialists in statistics, health economics, and computer science is uniquely able to conduct this research. Previously, we have done seminal work examining health care usage and health-related outcomes of elder abuse victims by linking adult protective services and police databases to health care data, which is highly relevant for this proposal. We also have deep experience in using Medicare claims data and machine learning for research. The long-term goal of our research is to leverage a better understanding of health care use by elder abuse victims to improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to help this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Elder abuse can have serious health consequences, but little is known about the patterns of their health care utilization. We propose to comprehensively examine the health care utilization and associated costs from known physical elder abuse cases using Medicare claims data.

"Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness PROJECT SUMMARY Access to mental health specialists is difficult for many patients in the U.S., particularly for the poor and those who live in rural communities. Telemental health is one potential solution for this access problem, and there has been rapid growth in the number of live video-based telemental health visits in the U.S. While there are numerous rigorous randomized-control trials comparing telemental health visits to in-person mental health specialist care, there have been little research on how telemental health is being used in real-world settings. The uptake of telemental health has been very uneven geographically, and what explains this variation is also largely unknown. Our mixed-methods proposal centers on filling these gaps in knowledge. Under the first aim, we will conduct a series of descriptive analyses of data on 75 million adults with Medicare or commercial insurance to understand how telemental health is being used in conjunction with in-person care and whether the growth of telemental health has decreased disparities in the use of mental health specialists among disadvantaged populations. Under the second aim, we seek to explain why there is geographic variation in uptake using robust statistical machine learning. Under the third aim, we exploit the variation in uptake to assess whether communities with greater telemental health penetration have experienced improvements in care for patients with mental illness. In the fourth aim we will conduct qualitative interviews with providers to complement the empirical analyses and understand the key contextual factors underlying our findings. Understanding how telemental health is being used, why there is variation in use of telemental health, and whether telemental health use is associated with higher quality care could help drive future telemental health interventions and influence the ongoing policy debate on telemedicine regulations and reimbursement. Together the results of these aims are consistent with the NIMH's expressed interest in innovative delivery models that can improve care for underserved communities. It is difficult for many patients with mental illness to access care from a mental health specialist. Telemental health is one way to potentially help these patients receive care and the number of such visits for mental illness has increased rapidly. In this project, we will study how telemental health is being used to care for patients with mental illness, what drives variation in use, and whether telemedicine is associated with receipt of higher quality care.",Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness,9472495,R01MH112829,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diffusion', 'Disabled Persons', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Telemedicine', 'Telemental', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care costs', 'contextual factors', 'control trial', 'demographics', 'design', 'disadvantaged population', 'experience', 'geographic difference', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'older patient', 'population health', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'rapid growth', 'rural area', 'severe mental illness', 'symposium', 'trend', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2018,698805,0.023547067012283932
"Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population world-wide. Although diabetic retinopathy has been well-studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME.  Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the VA uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME.  This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large.  The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center. Despite the significant visual loss associated with diabetic macular edema, little is known about the frequency of its occurrence, its risk factors, and the real-world effectiveness of existing treatments. The purpose of this proposed research is to utilize the VA National Patient Care Database to extract relevant data elements to examine these three clinical questions: 1) what is the incidence and prevalence of diabetic macular edema, 2) what are the risk factors associated with its development, and 3) what is the comparative real-world effectiveness of its treatments, including intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, intravitreal corticosteroid therapy and macular laser. The methods developed in this research proposal will not only further our understanding of DME but also generalize and enable future large-scale ophthalmic studies.",Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema,9574973,K23EY029246,"['Adopted', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Blindness', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Foundational Skills', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Handedness', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Centers', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Light Coagulation', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Smoking Status', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Veterans', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Washington', 'bevacizumab', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'diabetes management', 'diabetic', 'epidemiology study', 'hands-on learning', 'health administration', 'intravitreal injection', 'laser photocoagulation', 'macula', 'macular edema', 'mortality', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'screening', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapy outcome', 'traditional therapy', 'treatment optimization']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2018,237398,-0.01414575360526399

"Planning Changing Talk Online (CHATO): a Clinical Trial Testing the Effects of Online Communication Training for Nursing Home Staff on Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Residents with Dementia Abstract  The growing population of persons with dementia presents challenges to providing high quality nursing home (NH) care. Care is complicated by behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as persons with dementia lose cognitive and communication abilities and cannot verbally express unmet physical and psychosocial needs. NH staff use “elderspeak,” speech similar to baby talk, which is demeaning to residents. Residents react to elderspeak with BPSD resulting in increased use of psychotropic medication to control BPSD, higher staffing needs, more staff stress and turnover, and increased costs. The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff about elderspeak and better communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and BPSD in NH residents. The next step to increase the impact of this effective classroom-based training is to test CHAT content provided in online internet modules. CHAT training Online (CHATO) can improve access for busy staff and those in rural and small NHs to increase dissemination across care settings to improve dementia care.  This 1-year R34 Clinical Trial Planning Grant will prepare for a future clinical trial (in response to PA- 17-014, Addressing Unmet Needs in Persons with Dementia to Decrease Behavioral Symptoms and Improve Quality of Life) that will test the effects of CHATO training on resident BPSD in 120 NHs. The R34 project will orient our multidisciplinary research team to address new aims; recruit and enroll NHs; develop the clinical trial protocol, manual of operations, study documents, and data forms; solidify plans for data management and sharing and fidelity assurance, and obtain IRB approvals. The feasibility of an elderspeak feedback app for staff that may improve CHATO effects will also be demonstrated in the NH to prepare for the clinical trial.  In the planned R01 clinical trial, 120 NHs will be randomized to the CHATO training group or to the control group. BPSD data, extracted from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Nursing Home Compare and Minimum Data Set, will be compared using linear mixed modeling. NH strategies used to engage staff in CHATO (paid time off, recognition) and costs for various approaches will be identified. The effects of a self-monitoring app that uses natural language processing to give staff immediate feedback on their elderspeak use will be tested. This research addresses NINR's symptom management and caregiver support missions, NIA's milestones for nonpharmacological dementia care interventions, the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease goal to enhance care quality and efficiency, and the Alzheimer's Association Plan to build a workforce with high-quality care skills. The potential for reducing inappropriate use of psychoactive medications to control BPSD will be explored, addressing the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care. As the number of persons diagnosed with dementia triples in the next 30 years, empowering care providers to provide high quality care for individuals with dementia is of critical importance. Narrative The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease has identified education of dementia care providers as a top priority to address the need for quality care for the population of persons with dementia that will triple in the next 30 years. This R34 clinical trial planning grant will prepare for a future clinical trial testing online interactive communication training for nursing home staff that reduces ineffective elderspeak communication and behavioral and psychological symptoms of persons with dementia.

"Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation Project Summary Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a time-sensitive resuscitation procedure! essential for ventilation of newborns. It requires an unusually high level of skill due to the narrow airways, relatively large tongue, anterior glottic position, and low respiratory reserve of neonates (Bercic, Pocajt et al. 1978). Given the difficulty of the procedure and the high rate of complications in untrained hands, effective training is crucial. However, intubation success rates for pediatric residents are low under current resuscitation training programs and show little improvement between years 1-3 of residency (23-25%) (O'Donnell, Kamlin et al. 2006; Haubner, Barry et al. 2013). There is a pressing need to understand the factors that lead to poor training results and for innovative training modalities that can bridge the gap left by traditional training and thereby allow rapid skill acquisition. We hypothesize that current training and assessment methods suffer from 4 key weaknesses: (1) Poor realism: manikin and simulator-based training typically provide little variation in anatomy or difficulty level—key requirements for developing expertise (Dreyfus, Athanasiou et al. 1986)—and do not realistically model the look, feel, and motions of real tissue. (2) Subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods: training opportunities are limited by the availability of expert instructors. (3) Poor visualization: learners have poor knowledge about what went wrong and how to improve; they cannot see exactly what is going on inside the manikin or the patient and cannot directly monitor their actions relative to idealized, expert performance. (4) Assessment under artificially ideal conditions: assessments of ETI performance in classroom settings likely overestimate trainees' skill level because they do not mimic the stressors and distractions that are inherent in the real clinical environment. Technology-enhanced ETI simulators can resolve all of these key weaknesses: We have conducted preliminary work (Hahn, Li et al. 2016; Soghier, Li et al. 2014) on an augmented reality (AR (Azuma 1997)) manikin simulator driven by the motions of the trainee and physical manikin in real time that 1) provides a quantitative assessment of ETI technique and 2) allows the trainee to visualize the motion of the laryngoscope inside the manikin. The assessment score can provide feedback during the performance, as well as constitute part of the evaluation of the trainee's skill. Work under this proposal will build on this preliminary work. The specific aims are to: extend the current augmented reality (AR) manikin simulator to a virtual reality (VR) computer simulator and validate, extend and validate automated assessment and visualization algorithm for ETI, study training effectiveness by testing groups of pediatric residents across 3 years to quantify the effect of technology-enhanced methods relative to the current training regimen in terms of both intubation performance on simulators and clinical outcomes in patients, and assess performance under more realistic conditions. Project Narrative The current training and assessment of neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) suffers from key weaknesses of 1) poor realism of task simulators, 2) subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods, 3) poor visualization during simulation, and 4) assessment methods under artificially ideal conditions. This high-yield proposal will bridge the gap between training and clinical practice by using quantitative assessment tools and technology-enhanced simulation to improve ETI performance prior to patient care.",Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation,9547897,R01HD091179,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Hand', 'Imagery', 'Intratracheal Intubation', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatology', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Regimen', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'distraction', 'evidence base', 'haptics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'training opportunity', 'virtual reality']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,317404,-0.00773234161608754

We will test the effects of CHATO training on resident BPSD and psychotropic medication use in 120 NHs. In the R61 planning phase we will pilot test the online modules with NH staff to establish effects; recruit NH sites for the R33 trial; develop the clinical trial protocol, manual of operations, and data forms; develop data management, sharing, and fidelity assurance protocols; and obtain IRB approvals. A panel of NH administrators and staff will advise the team on recruitment strategies and a natural processing elderspeak feedback app will be tested in the clinical setting.  In R33 phase we will conduct the pragmatic trial in 120 NHs that will be randomly assigned to CHATO training or to the control group.

"STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias (ADRD) are debilitating conditions affecting more than 5 million Americans in 2014. It is projected that 8.4 million people with be diagnosed with ADRD over the next 15 years and health care costs attributable to ADRD are projected to be more than $1.2 trillion by 2050. Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are common and often involve aggressive behavior towards family caregivers (CG) in response to unmet needs, discomfort, or frustration. BPSD frequently lead to CG seeking medication to control patient symptoms. Antipsychotic use in persons with dementia (PWD) more than doubles mortality risk. The Choosing Wisely Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and American Geriatrics Society both recommend against prescribing antipsychotics as a first-line treatment for BPSD. Behavioral interventions such as STAR-Caregivers are efficacious first-line treatments for managing BPSD endorsed by the Administration on Aging. However, the programs have not been implemented widely – partly due to the intensity/cost of the programs and difficulty conducting outreach. No study has investigated CG willingness to reduce or discontinue antipsychotic use. We propose a Stage III clinical trial to ascertain the feasibility and acceptability of STAR Virtual Training and Follow-up (STAR- VTF) in which (a) training materials are delivered electronically and learning is self-directed, (b) caregivers have two in-home visits with a social worker and (c) where caregivers receive support from a social worker via secure messaging (email) within a web-based portal. We will compare outcomes in the STAR-VTF group to an attention control group (mailed material plus generic secure messages). Our specific aims are: (1) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of STAR-VTF to caregivers; (2) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program from the payer perspective; and (3) Test the hypotheses that (H1) caregiver participants in STAR-VTF will have lower levels of caregiver burden at 8 weeks and 6 months compared to an attention control group; and (H2) PWD participants in STAR-VTF will have lower rates of daily antipsychotic medication use at 6 months compared to attention control. We propose to recruit 100 CG-PWD dyads (50 in each arm). This will be the first study to test a low intensity, self-directed caregiver training program with secure message support from social workers. It will also be the first study to measure changes in antipsychotic medication use by PWD after CG training. The study is also innovative because it brings together leading experts in caregiver training, health information management, and care management. Third, this will be the first study to use automated data and natural language processing to identify potential caregivers in need of education/support at a time when antipsychotic medication use begins. Results of this study will inform a future multi-site trial in the Mental Health Research Network. NARRATIVE Our study evaluates the effectiveness of a caregiver outreach, training, and support program for caregivers of people with dementia who are using antipsychotic medication to manage agitation/aggression. We will conduct a randomized trial of the caregiver program compared to a control group to measure differences in caregiver burden and discontinuation of antipsychotic medication use.

"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life.

"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,9502161,K01HL141538,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Deglutition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palate', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Route', 'Shapes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prophylactic', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support tools', 'systematic review', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2018,143581,0.011947574652087019
"An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The candidate, Nishi Rawat, is a Critical Care physician and Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine at Johns Hopkins. Her goal is to become an independent investigator focused on advancing the field of quality improvement to improve the quality of health care delivered to Americans, while simultaneously reducing costs, with an emphasis on the application of information technology to evaluate performance, minimize waste and eliminate redundancies.  The candidate's preliminary work as a co-investigator for two collaboratives to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) suggests that there is a strong drive to eliminate preventable harms such as VAP, but weak available methodologies and resources to do so. There is a dire need for an effective and inexpensive methodology to track the delivery of evidence-based interventions for the purpose of quality improvement. The proposed research intends to fill this measurement gap. In this proposal, she evaluates the utility of the sensor approach for measuring and improving quality of care, focusing on VAP prevention intervention performance.  The aims propose: evaluate the utility of the sensor approach for measuring compliance with a VAP prevention intervention by comparing VAP process measure performance estimates captured by sensor technology to estimates obtained by traditional manual data collection (Aim 1); design and pilot a strategy to provide real-time feedback of sensor process measure compliance to providers (Aim 2); evaluate the impact of the sensor approach on VAP process measure compliance by comparing compliance before and after the implementation of the real-time feedback strategy (Aim 3). The proposed work could fundamentally change how healthcare monitors and reports important care interventions, and has the potential to make quality improvement more efficient, inexpensive and scalable.  The candidate is uniquely qualified to undertake the proposed work. She is double-board certified in Critical Care and Emergency Medicine, and has completed a Patient Safety and Quality fellowship. She has led multiple local quality improvement initiatives, and worked to decrease ICU costs as part of a national task force, and is currently co-investigator of large national infection prevention collaborative. It isher determination, enthusiasm and strong work ethic which have enabled her to balance these research activities with a heavy clinical commitment. She now needs protected time for research and career development to become an independent investigator. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to improve quality of care by using low-cost, off-the-shelf, and non-invasive sensor technology to automate the measurement and feedback of data regarding whether patients receive an evidence-based intervention, patient mobilization, to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.",An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia,9391190,K23HL125982,"['Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Advisory Committees', 'American', 'Anesthesiology', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Focus Groups', 'Frustration', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Infection prevention', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Nurses', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physician Assistants', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Measures', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Work Ethic', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career development', 'cost', 'design', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multi-component intervention', 'novel', 'patient mobility', 'patient safety', 'preference', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'professor', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia', 'wasting']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2018,197848,0.03897726385605556
"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9535990,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outcomes and Health Services Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2018,169112,0.008534100407483463
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,9534365,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2018,449751,0.022786867662633728
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,9666625,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2018,194005,0.009822134720437156
"Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research Unit SUMMARY   Approximately  25%  of  diabetic  patients  experience  diabetic  foot  ulcers  (DFUs).  This  is  a  significant  clinical  problem since there are no effective biomarkers for predicting outcomes, no drug candidates that have recently  been  FDA-­approved  and  no  therapies  that  are  widely  effective  in  treatment.  The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  2014  with  the  sole  purpose  of  facilitating  clinical  trials,  conducting  translational  research  and  providing  care  for  patients  with  chronic  wounds.  Stanford  AWCC  receives  patients  from the University Healthcare Alliance, which spans 60 clinics and 2.5 million people in the San Francisco Bay  Area.  Despite  being  in  a  relatively  prosperous  area,  Stanford  AWCC  treats  patients  from  diverse  socio-­ demographics. In the past two years, Stanford has treated 6000 patients with wounds, of whom 705 had DFUs.  50%  of  the  patients  enroll  in  clinical  trials  and  there  is  a  very  low  dropout  rate  (less  than  5%).  Under  Dr.  Geoffrey  Gurtner’s  leadership,  the  Stanford  AWCC  has  conducted  over  25  clinical  trials,  where  we  have  measured biomarkers and tested novel therapeutic interventions (Aim 1).     It is known that wound healing trials experience a significantly higher failure rate in Phase III studies compared  to  any  other  drug  trial.  This  is  primarily  due  to  the  poorly  controlled  procedural  component  of  wound  care.  At  Stanford,  we  address  these  issues  by  (i)  practicing  a  multi-­disciplinary  approach  overseen  by  physicians,  (ii)  standardizing  the  measuring  and  reporting  of  healing  outcomes,  (iii)  emphasizing  rigorous  and  efficient  operational  processes  during  clinical  trial  conduct  and  (iv)  collaborating  with  other  major  academic  centers  (Aim  2).  Looking  forward,  it  is  critical  to  optimize  patient  engagement  during  their  treatment  regimens  and  inculcate  a  shared  decision-­making  process.  Clinical  studies  in  medical  fields  such  as  cancer  have  indicated  that  such  patient-­centered  approaches  lead  to  the  adherence  of  treatment  regimens  and  clinical  trials.  This  is  currently  lacking  in  with  patients  with  DFUs.  With  Dr.  Arden  Morris’s  expertise,  the  Stanford  AWCC  practices  new approaches that centers around the patient, with a focus on improvement in their quality of life (Aim 3).     Dr.  Nigam  Shah,  the  Director  of  Bioinformatics  at  Spectrum,  Stanford’s  Clinical  and  Translational  Sciences  Award  has  worked  with  the  Stanford  AWCC  and  developed  computational  tools  that  predict  wound  healing  outcomes. These models have been developed using data from the Healogics database, the country’s largest  network  of  wound  care  clinics  and  a  Stanford  AWCC  operational  partner.  Dr.  Shah  also  has  expertise  in  analyzing electronic health records of patients from large databases such as TRUVEN and OPTUM, which will  allow  for  the  determination  of  unique  biomarkers  for  wound  healing  through  computational  modeling.  These  models can be executed across the entire Diabetic Foot Consortium (Aim 4).    Narrative    The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  October  2014  to  fill  both  a  clinical  and  academic  need  by  integrating  clinical  trials  and  research  in  wound  care.  Since  its  launch,  the  number  of  patients  with  DFUs  at  Stanford  AWCC  has  doubled  in  each  of  the  past  two  years  and  the  unit  has  been  financially  successful,  ensuring  its  long-­term  viability.  Here,  we  demonstrate  the  ability  of  Stanford  AWCC  to  serve  as  a  Clinical  Research  Unit  (CRU)  by  displaying  access  to  patients  with  DFUs  from  a  wide  sociodemographic, emphasizing quality of clinical research conducted, demonstrating ways of patient-­centered  collaborative decision making and using big data to accurately predict and quantify wound healing outcomes.           ",Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research

"Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Patient-Reported Outcome (RISE-PRO) Dissemination Project PROJECT SUMMARY Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are important in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a condition that affects 1.3 million Americans and is a leading cause of disability. Among chronic conditions, RA has many decades of robust scientific evidence around the validity of PROs. PROs are key outcome measures in RA clinical trials and studies, are responsive to therapy changes, are strong predictors of future disability and mortality, and play a central role in facilitating shared decision-making and treatment. Advances in health information technology (IT), like electronic health record-enabled Qualified Clinical Data Registries (QCDRs), provide an opportunity to scale and spread of use of PRO measures nationally. The Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness (RISE) registry is a QCDR that was established in 2014 to improve the quality of care for patients seen in rheumatology practices. The RISE informatics platform aggregates electronic health record data from participating practices, analyzes these data centrally and feeds performance on quality measures back to clinicians using a web-based dashboard. RISE currently includes one the largest PRO measurement efforts for ambulatory patients with a chronic disease in the United States. However, as the registry matures, several critical gaps remain in our national PRO measurement efforts, including the lack of representation of public hospital systems and at-risk populations, the challenges faced by some practices in creating structured data fields in electronic health records to capture PRO measure scores, and the need to evaluate the impact of the PRO collection efforts through RISE. The overarching goal of this proposal is to systematically address each of these issues by 1) creating an evidence-based clinical learning network to support the participation of public hospital systems in PRO measurement and improvement efforts through RISE, 2) developing and scaling a natural language processing system to extract PRO measures from unstructured data in clinical notes, and 3) analyzing the impact of PRO measurement through RISE on quality of care and health outcomes in RA. This proposal builds on the novel informatics platform of the RISE registry to scale, spread and evaluate PRO implementation across a nationwide network of rheumatology practices, with the ultimate goal of improving functional status outcomes for those with RA. PROJECT NARRATIVE The RISE-PRO project aims to use the novel health IT platform of the RISE patient registry to scale, spread and evaluate the collection of patient-reported outcomes across a nationwide network of rheumatology practices. Collecting and using patient-reported outcomes in clinical practice has the potential to transform health care for individuals with rheumatoid arthritis by making care more patient-centered and by providing tools to facilitate shared decision-making, disease monitoring, and population health management.",Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Patient-Reported Outcome (RISE-PRO) Dissemination Project,9571470,R18HS025638,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R18,2018,492523,-0.00865370492000454
"Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems V (CAHPS V) Consumers, providers and health care purchasers need high-quality information to help them compare and evaluate their health care options. The CAHPS V project will advance the AHRQ CAHPS mission of improving patients' experiences with health care by developing and evaluating strategies for survey measurement, reporting and quality improvement (QI). We propose a 5-year effort to advance the science and practice of patient experience assessment, continue innovation to ensure relevance to health service delivery and implement best survey practices, further the science of reporting, and evaluate CAHPS QI efforts. We will develop program communication strategies, and disseminate and promote use of CAHPS products. In particular, we will develop a survey to assess patient experiences with end-of-life care; develop new items to assess shared decision-making, care coordination, patient engagement, and patient safety; test alternatives to the standard CAHPS modes of data collection), explore the feasibility of administering a short-form survey dividing CG-CAHPS composites among respondents to reduce response burden, elicit stakeholder feedback about the value of different CAHPS supplement item sets, evaluate “The Your CAHPS Survey” that was designed to help users of the CAHPS surveys compile a survey tailed to their specific needs, and evaluate existing Spanish translations of CAHPS surveys. In addition, we will gather input from stakeholders on best practices for narrative data analysis, develop an approach for using automated Natural Language Processing for analyses of narratives, and construct an algorithm approach to select representative narratives that reflect and illustrate overall provider ratings. Finally, we will evaluate the contribution of patient narratives to quality improvement efforts in hospital care for children, characterize primary care practices use of the CG-CAHPS survey and patient-centered medical home items during PCMH transformation, assess the impact of pay- for-performance for care delivered by primary and specialty care safety net providers on CAHPS survey responses, explore the value of new shared decision-making, patient engagement, communication and patient safety items for QI and identify QI strategies that improve patient experience across various settings. We will also advance analytic methods for CAHPS data. The project team is well suited to achieving the study objectives given its prior accomplishments and established working relationships. The work is innovative and designed to facilitate the use of CAHPS surveys and improve response rates to them, enhance reporting and use of CAHPS survey data, and improve health care QI efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will advance public health by developing new CAHPS survey items for end-of-life care, shared decision-making, care coordination, patient engagement, and patient safety, promoting use of CAHPS surveys by implementing and evaluating an interactive database tool designed to assist with the assembly of CAHPS surveys, creating parsimonious variants of CAHPS surveys, evaluating alternative methods of data collection designed to improve response rates, enhancing the collection and use of patient narrative data in reports about health care, and assessing the impact of CAHPS surveys and reports on quality improvement efforts and patient experiences with care.",Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems V (CAHPS V),9569636,U18HS025920,[' '],AHRQ,RAND CORPORATION,U18,2018,1149018,0.025020625156221794
"A Training and Fidelity Model to Move and Scale Evidence-based Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Programs into Practice: The Case for COPE in PACE service settings This NIA Stage I study is designed to address two leading barriers to implementation of evidence-based dementia care and caregiver support programs into long-term care settings: (1) lack of streamlined, user-friendly, and tested training modalities, and (2) lack of scalable, practical processes to accurately measure fidelity in “real world” settings. The aims of the study are to determine whether an online training program is the same or better in improving interventionist fidelity to an evidence based dementia program (COPE) and dementia patient outcomes when compared to a high intensity face-to-face traditional form of training. To accomplish these aims we will develop an online, principle-driven approach using state-of-the- science simulation and best practices and a scalable approach to assess fidelity to COPE by applying computational linguistics techniques. We will then conduct a noninferiority trial in Programs for All Inclusive Care for Elders (PACE) organizations randomly assigned to the training conditions. PACE staff will be evaluated post training on their fidelity outcomes. Dyads of persons with dementia and their caregivers will be evaluated at 4 months post COPE implementation on function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and caregiver burden. The findings from this project will lay the essential groundwork for a large scale, Stage III-IV, pragmatic trial of COPE in PACE settings throughout the US. Findings will also serve as a model for guiding the development of practical, scalable processes for training and fidelity monitoring in other long-term care settings and for other evidence-based support programs. Most persons with dementia and their caregivers do not have access to or receive beneficial and supportive evidence-based programs due to the need for scalable and reliable training and monitoring procedures for clinicians. We address this gap to developing and testing a replicable, accessible, and sustainable processes for training and monitoring clinicians in Care of Persons in the Environments (COPE) - an evidence based dementia care program - in a long-term care service setting. Study findings will yield an understanding of ways to move evidence into real-world dementia care settings and can serve as a model for guiding the development of practical, scalable processes for training and fidelity monitoring in other long-term care settings and for other evidence-based support programs.",A Training and Fidelity Model to Move and Scale Evidence-based Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Programs into Practice: The Case for COPE in PACE service settings,9683680,R01AG061945,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver support', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Day Care', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Registered nurse', 'Science', 'Service setting', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'care providers', 'care systems', 'comparative efficacy', 'dementia care', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'pragmatic trial', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'uptake', 'user-friendly']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,569374,0.0446597008855921
"Leveraging Routine Clinical Materials and Mobile Technology to Assess CBT Quality Project Abstract: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been demonstrated to be effective for numerous presenting problems, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Several large mental health systems have invested heavily in programs to train their clinicians in CBTs, but relatively little attention has been devoted to the monitoring or promotion of CBT quality after training is complete. Identifying strategies to do so can facilitate research and training, and is critical to ensuring consumer access to high quality, evidence-based treatments. The lack of a scalable, effective, and efficient method of monitoring quality is a key barrier to efforts to promote high-quality implementation. Self-report fidelity assessments increase clinician and consumer burden and may not accurately reflect clinician skill or the intensity with which CBT interventions are delivered. Observation and expert ratings are time and resource intensive and unlikely to be feasible or affordable in large systems. To maximize the likelihood of broad implementation once effective strategies to monitor quality are established, it is essential that these strategies are feasible and acceptable in routine care contexts, leveraging information collected during routine care. To date, few monitoring strategies that do not involve observation, client/caregiver reports, or clinician self-reports have been tested. To address this critical implementation challenge, we propose to refine and evaluate a method of monitoring quality that is based on an evaluation of CBT worksheets that are completed in session. Because the worksheets were developed to implement core cognitive and behavioral elements and are embedded in CBTs across diagnostic categories, they may be used to elucidate the clinician’s ability to guide the client through CBT interventions in session. Preliminary research with this measure demonstrated high correlations between the measure and observer ratings of clinician competence, associations with subsequent symptom change, and high agreement between raters with differing levels of familiarity with CBT. Completion of the ratings based on worksheets requires only a small fraction of time required for session observation and ratings. This project will compare this novel strategy to observer ratings and adherence checklists that are embedded in clinical notes. Furthermore, it will compare the accuracy of worksheet data collected by mobile app to paper-form worksheets, and assess the feasibility and acceptability of these strategies. Because the core elements of CBT and its worksheets are common across many CBTs, this research has broad implications for monitoring fidelity to CBTs in a variety of mental health and healthcare systems and settings. This research will be conducted by a team of investigators with expertise in CBT, training, implementation, psychotherapy process and outcome research, psychometrics, longitudinal data analysis, mobile technologies and healthcare economics, with input from community partners and end-users. The resulting products have the potential to significantly improve efforts to monitor and ensure ongoing high quality implementation of CBT in routine care settings. Project Narrative: This project will compare two methods of assessing the quality of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that do not involve directly observing sessions, adherence checklists embedded in clinical notes, and rating the quality of worksheets that are completed with therapist guidance during sessions. It will also examine whether ratings of worksheets completed on a mobile app are reliable and valid quality measures. This information can inform strategies to monitor and enhance CBT quality, which can ultimately improve the quality of care and clinical outcomes.",Leveraging Routine Clinical Materials and Mobile Technology to Assess CBT Quality,9474211,R01MH112628,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Anxiety', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Familiarity', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Light', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Paper', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychotherapy', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'clinical material', 'cognitive enhancement', 'community setting', 'cost', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care economics', 'health care settings', 'health economics', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel strategies', 'predict clinical outcome', 'programs', 'routine care', 'skills', 'standard measure', 'statistics']",NIMH,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2018,654472,0.02065942565272583
"Individualized Signal Processing Strategy :Phase II This project describes a novel approach to automate and individualize the signal processing strategy for hearing aids (HA) that can result in improved speech intelligibility in background noise, greater user satisfaction and acceptance for HAs, and reduce barriers to affordable hearing health care. The proposed Individualized Signal Processing Strategy (ISPS) is based on individual performance on categorical perception tasks for speech stimuli. This differs from traditional methods based on sophisticated gain models built upon average perception, performance, and preference data. The ability to determine one’s ISPS automatically, rapidly and remotely can result in dramatic cost-savings and greater accessibility to hearing health care for patients who cannot afford it or for those who lack easy access to the necessary expertise. These technical achievements have the potential to radically change HA service delivery models yet can be implemented within existing business models and in concert with current practitioners. The ISPS method effectively replaces target-based HA fitting (e.g. NAL-NL2) with individualized speech-based parameter adjustment. The proposed work follows successful completion of our pilot project and builds upon the research team’s prior research on novel fitting methods for cochlear implant (CI) devices recently acquired by Cochlear, Ltd. Following the successful implementation of ISPS and integration with commercial HA software in the pilot study, we demonstrated feasibility including a field study in which performance outcomes for the ISPS method were as good as a conventional HA fitting method and only took a fraction of the time, despite ISPS having no prior knowledge of patient characteristics and no audiogram. Successful maturation and commercialization of the ISPS technology in Phase II will address several barriers identified in the previous RFA-DC-12-004 including physical, infrastructure, and knowledge barriers (by allowing remote or self-fitting HAs), economic barriers (by reducing overall costs), and cultural barriers (by providing easy access to HA fitting for patients who tend to avoid professional help). This Phase II project will develop an operational ISPS method by (1) integrating ISPS with hardware/software systems of our industry partners, (2) refine and enhance the ISPS method to improve efficiency and effectiveness of fitting hearing instruments, (3) build support for the use of ISPS in multiple marketplaces, and (4) evaluate the technology through field trials in different service delivery environments by comparing outcomes with ISPS fitting to those achieved with traditional prescriptive gain fitting within the same subjects. Following successful demonstration of these objectives, a Phase III project will focus on the transition of the technology to support remote and self-fitting of hearing instruments. This project seeks to develop, implement and test a novel automated method for fitting hearing aids based on real-time speech perception performance. This automated approach can improve hearing aid success while significant reducing costs of hearing health care. The automation of the fitting procedure can dramatically increase accessibility of hearing health care.",Individualized Signal Processing Strategy :Phase II,9472306,R44DC016249,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Audiology', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Automation', 'Businesses', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Cost Savings', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sensorineural Hearing Loss', 'Service delivery model', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'graph theory', 'health care service', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inclusion criteria', 'industry partner', 'instrument', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'satisfaction', 'service delivery', 'signal processing', 'software systems', 'sound', 'success']",NIDCD,"SECURBORATION, INC.",R44,2018,732079,-0.03654634430041862
"Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks Project Summary/Abstract Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), particularly carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs), are a major cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Though studies have found multiple interventions addressing MDRO colonization and transmission to be effective at reducing HAIs, implementation has lagged due to questions regarding the most efficacious combination of interventions. As healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals, long-term care facilities, or outpatient surgical centers and clinics) are part of an interconnected healthcare network, evaluation of an intervention’s impact on transmission and infection must consider the dynamics across the healthcare system. To address remaining knowledge gaps regarding the most effective combinations of intervention strategies, we will build a multi-level model that spans from individual patients to regionally interconnected healthcare facilities. The resulting framework will provide hospital administrators and infection control experts with tools for quantifying individual patient risk factors for colonization and infection and for comparing the potential effectiveness of interventions to control HAIs. The aims of the project are: (1) to develop models to estimate the underlying prevalence and incidence of CROs and predict which patients are at highest risk for colonization and infection with CROs using clinical samples collected during the normal course of care; (2) to utilize hospital-level models to quantify the combinatorial relationship between, and marginal impact of, additional interventions to reduce HAIs; and (3) to build a regional model of a healthcare system to examine the effectiveness of interventions across institutions. Models will start with the patient at the center, utilizing the rich covariate data stored in electronic medical records to develop prediction models based on advanced machine learning. These prediction models will be translatable tools that can be directly incorporated into clinical care to assist clinicians in preventing HAIs. In addition, they will form the foundation of hospital-level models that will allow for detailed examinations of the effectiveness of different combinations of interventions. Hospital-level models will then be embedded in a network of healthcare facilities that accounts for the differing incentives faced by geographically dispersed facilities with variable demographic populations. These models will directly inform CDC guidelines about MDRO prevention and aid clinicians in reducing the risk of HAIs. Project Narrative The models developed through this proposal will improve understanding of how biological factors associated with the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) impact interventions to reduce hospital-associated infections (HAIs). This will aid predictions of patients’ risk for colonization and infection, as well as improve understanding of how interventions can most effectively be combined to reduce the likelihood that patients will suffer from these high-consequence pathogens.",Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks,9535814,U01CK000536,[' '],NCEZID,"CENTER/ DISEASE DYNAMICS, ECONOM/POLICY",U01,2018,649871,0.012125122615795025
"Clinical practice patterns and healthcare resource utilization in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: using real world data to bridge the evidence gap PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This F32 fellowship award will provide Dr. Erica Farrand with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented clinical research in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); (2) to develop a unique skill set in collecting, analyzing and interpreting real-world data; (3) to gain advanced skills in epidemiology, biostatistics and data science methods to conduct clinical research; (4) to advance the IPF field by improving our understanding of the clinical impact of acute exacerbation of IPF. To achieve these goals, Dr. Farrand will conduct clinical investigations in two distinct healthcare systems, the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Health and Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). IPF is a progressive fibrotic lung disease associated with high morbidity and mortality and over $1 billion in healthcare cost annually. Acute exacerbation of IPF, is an acute respiratory deterioration and arguably the most clinically significant event in the natural history of the disease. The fundamental aim of this NRSA proposal is to leverage the electronic health records of UCSF Health and KPNC to generate real-world evidence regarding the epidemiology of acute exacerbation of IPF, the nature and variability of its clinical management and health care utilization across settings, and the impact of common management strategies on clinical outcomes. Research in this fellowship will utilize electronic health record data to define the acute exacerbation population using a case-validated diagnostic algorithm (Aim 1), document the scope and impact of acute exacerbation on clinical practice and healthcare resource utilization, comparing the UCSF and KPNC systems (Aim 2), and determine the association of common management approaches with hospital based and short-term patient-outcomes (Aim 3). This project will demonstrate the power of leveraging high-quality electronic health record data to both advance our understanding of a clinical condition and document the association of treatment interventions with patient and system level outcomes NARRATIVE Episodes of acute respiratory deterioration known as acute exacerbations are the most clinically significant events in the natural history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and limited data exist to guide the management of acute exacerbations of IPF. The impact of acute exacerbations on health care resource utilization across health care settings has not been characterized. Leveraging high-quality real-world data from the electronic health records of two large medical systems, we will address this knowledge gap by defining the clinical impact of acute exacerbation of IPF on the patient and healthcare system level; this work will demonstrate the power of real-world data for clinical research, and lay the foundation for future pragmatic studies of IPF.",Clinical practice patterns and healthcare resource utilization in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: using real world data to bridge the evidence gap,9610527,F32HL143920,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulation', 'Award', 'Bilateral', 'Biometry', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Intensive Care', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Lung diseases', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Management', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'System', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Ventilator', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'comparative effectiveness', 'day length', 'disease natural history', 'effectiveness trial', 'electronic data', 'evidence based guidelines', 'health care service utilization', 'health care settings', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'improved', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient oriented', 'pragmatic trial', 'prognostic', 'prospective test', 'respiratory', 'skills', 'survival outcome']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2018,71077,-0.023153679151835353
"Detecting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Pediatric Emergency Department Care Using the PECARN Data Registry. Project Summary Understanding and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care are national priorities. There is growing evidence that such disparities extend to the care of children. Our overall goals are to Detect, Understand, and Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the emergency care of children. Through this proposal we will have the capacity to utilize the AHRQ funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Registry, a comprehensive clinical registry of all pediatric emergency department (ED) visits from 7 EDs to detect racial and ethnic disparities in the management of children seeking care in the ED. Once we detect the magnitude of racial and ethnic disparities in health care provision, we can then seek to understand why such disparities exist, which can then inform interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity. Through rigorous evaluation and use of multicenter comprehensive clinical data, this proposal will provide critical evidence and lay the framework for the next steps of our research mission - to develop and test interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of pediatric emergency care.

"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence.

"Drivers of Variation in Contact Networks in Long Term Care Facilities PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to improve understanding of transmission of resistant bacteria by characterizing contact networks in a national sample of approximately 25 long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Each participating LTCF will be visited twice during the course of this study for primary data collection. Healthcare professional (HCP) – resident contact networks will be ascertained in several different ways. We define contact networks as interactions between individuals that have the potential to mediate transmission. Our primary technique for estimating who contacted whom will be through self-report by health care professionals in the participating LTCFs. This approach will be compared to use of information about staff assignments, unit sub-divisions, and staff-resident ratios to make inferences about contact patterns. In addition, we will use direct observation to collect information about room entry rates and behaviors, such as hand hygiene, that influence whether an interaction results in acquisition. Facility and resident assessments will also be performed through chart review and survey. Resident level data will include presence of devices, infection status, antibiotic use, wound care, and comorbidities. In one to two of the participating facilities, we will use two new technologies to capture more detailed data on contacts within LTCFs. First, we will use a badge-based-sensor network to construct networks on the basis of personal proximity. This approach will allow us to examine how healthcare professionals and residents move within units of LTCFs and to analyze sequences of close contacts. However, this technology may not be sufficient to determine if the healthcare professional touched the patient. Thus, in a smaller number of rooms, we will use a second technological strategy, computer vision and depth sensing. This approach makes it feasible to collect highly granular data on behaviors such as use of gowns, gloves, and masks. Our analytical models will focus on dependencies between contact network structure, facility characteristics, and individual resident and HCP attributes. We will determine whether the number of unique contacts per individual are statistically dissimilar for different types of residents and HCPs. Alternative ways to derive contact networks will be compared with respect to overlap and completeness. Temporal models will also be used to examine dynamic changes in networks over time. Our hypothesis is that the structure of contact networks will vary according to the clinical services offered by LTCFs and that these structural properties will have significant implications for transmission and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our study will examine patterns of contacts between healthcare professionals and residents in a national sample of long term care facilities. Contact networks have been a major focus of epidemiological studies of infection transmission, but much more work has been done in community populations than in healthcare settings. Our goal is to advance understanding how diseases can spread within long term care facilities and to enhance our ability to evaluate the effectiveness of different infection control interventions.",Drivers of Variation in Contact Networks in Long Term Care Facilities,9663122,U01CK000555,[' '],NCEZID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2018,779516,0.0108667104632885
"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems. Applying assistive technology to monitor worrisome behaviors, improve safety, and reduce social isolation in the home environment can reduce caregiver burden and improve care in ways that have major public health benefits.",Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers,9558429,R44AG059458,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applied Research', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'California', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fire - disasters', 'Floods', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Genes', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Mental Health', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Redwood', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'caregiver interventions', 'community setting', 'dementia caregiving', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'emotional behavior', 'flexibility', 'hazard', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'loved ones', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'social media', 'software systems', 'theories', 'user-friendly']",NIA,PEOPLE POWER COMPANY,R44,2018,825561,0.0022417192858571783
"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This eMERGE III proposal builds on past discoveries and research designed to translate genomic advances into clinical care involving clinicians, patients and families. This phase focuses on traits associated with preventable health concerns: colon cancer, triglycerides, and immunity. We address optimal methods to share information across families and whether other information found by genomic tests impact the care, health, and medical costs of individuals.","The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III",9491866,U01HG008657,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amendment', 'American', 'Asians', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Community Practice', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Digital Libraries', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Immunity', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Other Genetics', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Social Impacts', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Triglycerides', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'economic outcome', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'online resource', 'outreach', 'patient portal', 'polyposis', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2018,840228,0.005945089794237677
"Novel Methods for Evaluation and Implementation of Behavioral Intervention Technologies for Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is projected to be a leading cause of burden of disease globally and in the United States. In the United States, in 2012 alone, an estimated 16 million adults aged 18 or older (7% of all adults) had at least one major depressive episode. While psychological treatments are effective at treating depression, the high prevalence of MDD makes it impossible to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) use technologies such as mobile phones to support behavior change to improve mental health, and have been shown to have similar effects to psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. With the growing number of mobile phone users, BIT is a viable and promising option for delivering psychotherapy. On the other hand, the current evaluation framework of new interventions is not adequate for evaluating and implementing BITs, because of the rapidly evolving BIT landscape and the complexity of the interventions. This research aims to develop and validate novel concepts and evaluation framework to address these two challenges in the dissemination and implementation of BITs in MDD patients in pragmatic settings. We plan to achieve this research goal in four steps. First, we will develop a new statistical design, called open-ended adaptive randomization (OAR) procedure, which will enable us to continuously evaluate BITs that enter and leave a care delivery system. The OAR also aims to improve quality of care given to the participating patients, by sequentially allocating patients away from inferior BITs based on the interim evidence during deployment. Second, we will develop a data analytical technique, called regularized Q-learning, which will enable us to perform variable selection in high-dimensional settings and retain only the important predictors of health outcomes in the learning model. While the original Q-learning is a cutting-edge technique originating from the computer science literature, the research will extend its capability to handle high-dimensional data and enrich the learning model by incorporating regularized regression. Third, we will prepare for the next implementation phase of the proposed methods, by calibrating the methods with computer simulations, creating an initial knowledge base by analyzing data from current randomized clinical trials, identifying partnerships with healthcare providers and app curation plaftorms. Fourth, we will advocate for the general implementation of the proposed methods by producing publications, building cognitive computing systems, and tracking the source of citation and adoption of the published results by the broader health research community. Our long-term goal is to enhance our capability of deploying complex interventions such as BITs to depressed patients in a personalized and evidence-based manner throughout the healthcare system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common, and imposes a high societal cost in terms of quality of life, work productivity, functional status, morbidity and mortality. The national healthcare system will not be able to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. With the growing number of smartphone use, behavioral intervention technologies have become a viable and scalable option to deliver psychotherapy to the population. This research proposes novel evaluation and implementation concepts and methods that aim to extend our capacity to adopt these technologies in an evidence-based manner.",Novel Methods for Evaluation and Implementation of Behavioral Intervention Technologies for Depression,9412888,R01MH109496,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Evidence based practice', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Inferior', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Science', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'burden of illness', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'cognitive computing', 'computer science', 'depressed patient', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'efficacy study', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'functional status', 'high dimensionality', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'preference', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research data dissemination', 'sensor', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'smartphone Application', 'societal costs', 'statistics', 'technology development']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,396101,-0.010649766252945987
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,9519046,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'feasibility trial', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention cost', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'learning strategy', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social cognitive theory', 'societal costs', 'socioeconomics', 'vulnerable adolescent', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2018,620198,0.006281287093640313
"Avoidable Acute Care Use among Patients with Lupus PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Candace Feldman is an Instructor in Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy and the Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). Dr. Feldman has a longstanding passion to understand and reduce disparities in rheumatic diseases. Her research focuses on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in prevalence, access and outcomes among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Her 14 peer-reviewed original publications, 8 first author, and 2 early career development grants exemplify her track record and her commitment to this field. She holds a MPH degree and is pursuing a doctorate in social epidemiology from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her immediate goals are to learn and apply advanced health services research and qualitative methods to understand SLE-related avoidable acute care use to inform a future intervention. She will be guided by Dr. Costenbader, an established SLE epidemiologist, and an expert mentoring team. Dr. Feldman strives to apply rigorous methods to redesign healthcare delivery for vulnerable rheumatology patients. Environment: Dr. Feldman’s Division Chief ensures that >75% of her time will be protected for research and career development for the 5-year duration of this K23 award. She has financial support to supplement her salary and project-related expenses from the Division, the SCS, and her primary mentor’s funding. The BWH Lupus Center, co-directed by Dr. Costenbader, is the largest in New England. The research infrastructure established as part of the Center will enable Dr. Feldman to recruit patients. In addition, the SCS has extensive research infrastructure, which will continue to support her work. Dr. Feldman has access to Medicaid data under Dr. Costenbader’s Data Use Agreement with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and to Partners HealthCare electronic health records linked to claims data through the explicit support of Population Health Management. For her training, she will have access to courses and mentorship at HSPH, where she is a doctoral student, and through Harvard Medical School and the Harvard Catalyst Program. Research: Dr. Feldman will rigorously define SLE-related conditions that may result in avoidable acute care use (e.g. emergency department visits and hospitalizations). She will then examine rates and predictors of potentially avoidable use, and associated mortality and costs in two large, diverse datasets. She will learn and apply qualitative methods, including Photovoice, which will empower SLE patients to photograph their homes and communities, to explore the contribution of social determinants to avoidable care use. Dr. Feldman will hold focus groups of SLE patients, providers and administrators to design a rheumatology-based intervention to improve healthcare delivery for these high-utilizing, vulnerable SLE patients. Dr. Feldman will develop skills in rigorous mixed methods research. This project, and the training Dr. Feldman will gain, will position her for a R01 and for a career as an independent social epidemiology and patient-oriented investigator in rheumatology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lupus is a complex autoimmune disease, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and resulting in high acute care use, much of which could be prevented if patients had consistent access to high-quality outpatient care. There is a need to define and understand lupus-specific avoidable acute care use (emergency department visits and hospitalizations) and to identify those patients at highest risk.

"Machine Learning for Health Outcomes and Quality of Care in Low-Income Populations PROJECT SUMMARY: Life expectancy and other health outcomes in the United States are associated with income and socioeconomic status. Low-income populations have poorer health outcomes and, unlike high-income populations, outcomes also vary by geography. While these relationships have been described for decades in prior literature, the underlying mechanisms of these connections have not been identified. Understanding the determinants of such health disparities is critical to improving health outcomes and preventing disease. The impact of health insurance on health outcomes in low-income populations is unknown, as it has not been studied empirically on a national scale. The proposed research will be the first ever study to employ randomization of health plans in Medicaid, the government insurance program for individuals who lack resources to pay for health care. We will establish the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes in low-income populations. This will involve a novel data source containing enrollment and health care utilization information for the universe of low-income households in Massachusetts from 2006 to 2015. We are uniquely positioned to study the effect of Medicaid and type of Medicaid coverage as our data contains enrollees who were randomly assigned to plans and those who were not. These data are linked to important health outcomes, including cause of death, birth weight, and APGAR scores. We will additionally exploit our partial random assignment to examine effect modification by quality of care. Disparities exist in quality of care along income lines, and low-income populations tend to have lower quality scores. To accomplish these goals, we propose the creation of a nonparametric machine learning framework for generalizing results from experimental and quasi-experimental studies. This flexible robust methodology will be developed and tailored for our study of health disparities in order to generalize results from within-state studies to i) the full population of low-income individuals within a state and ii) populations of low-income individuals in other states. With average monthly Medicaid enrollment of over 55 million individuals across the country, this project will have significant broad impacts on low-income populations. Our findings and new analytic tools will provide foundational understanding of the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes among low-income populations, including any effect modification by quality of care. Unraveling the complicated relationships between insurance and health outcomes in low-income populations is an essential component toward improving these outcomes. The lack of randomization in most public health studies on disparities has contributed to diverging results and confusion around interpretation for health policy. The development of our machine learning framework for the generalizability of population health studies is innovative as it will revolutionize the ability of researchers to assess the effects of health exposures and interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Health outcomes and quality of care in low-income populations lag behind other groups, and the impact of health insurance on these disparities among low-income individuals is currently unknown. The goal of this proposal is to examine the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes in low-income populations with rigorous new tools in partially randomized data. This will be achieved by developing a novel machine learning framework for the generalizability of experimental and quasi- experimental studies, providing population health scientists with robust methodology to assess the effects of health interventions and exposures.",Machine Learning for Health Outcomes and Quality of Care in Low-Income Populations,9346982,DP2MD012722,"['Apgar Score', 'Birth Weight', 'Cause of Death', 'Confusion', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Foundations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Planning', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'High-Income Populations', 'Household', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicaid', 'Methodology', 'Modification', 'Outcome', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'United States', 'analytical tool', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'population health', 'prevent', 'programs', 'tool']",NIMHD,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP2,2017,1378477,0.019899854698157964
"Automated Coding of eCoaching Exchanges to Promote Healthier Eating Poor eating habits, particularly low fruit and vegetable intake, is a growing, serious public health concern, particularly among young adults age 21-30, referred to as Generation Y (GenY). GenY's poor dietary practices are associated with the onset of obesity and many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, as well as declines in predicted health status and life expectancy. Thus, there is a need to develop effective interventions to improve GenY's eating habits. MENU GenY is a computer-based intervention to encourage increased fruit and vegetable intake among GenY. A critical component of MENU GenY is personalized eCoaching. eCoaches use email to deliver motivation-enhancing coaching to encourage healthy eating, grounded in the principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI), an evidence-based communication technique to increase intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy for behavior change. The MI model posits that counselor's use of “MI-consistent” communication techniques are responsible for eliciting behavior change through patient “change talk” (i.e., statements about one's own desire, ability, reasons, need for or commitment to behavior change). A growing body of empirical evidence links change talk to behavior change, but research identifying the specific provider behaviors that elicit patient change talk is limited to specific populations (mainly adults who abuse substances and a couple studies of adolescents). Identifying specific communication strategies linked to behavior change and integrating these strategies into communication-based interventions (e.g., brief, motivation-enhancing interventions delivered in a variety of settings or public health initiatives) can increase these interventions' potency. However, a significant barrier to this research is the qualitative methods traditionally used to analyze the communication process which are resource-intensive, requiring an iterative process of human (subjective) interpretation of text. Rapidly developing computational technologies, specifically machine learning combined with classification models, offer a unique opportunity to accelerate this process. Our research group has recently applied machine learning-based data mining models to similar communication data. We automated a simple communication code scheme to characterize patient communication and achieved accuracy comparable to human coders. The goals of this study are to leverage innovative computer science machine learning and classification models to fully automate the communication coding process and link patterns in eCoach-patient communication to increases in fruit and vegetable intake. We propose a secondary analysis of data collected for a NICHD randomized clinical trial (R01 HD067314). The sample is 160 members of GenY drawn from both urban and rural settings (Detroit metropolitan area and rural Pennsylvania) with outcomes measured at baseline and 3 months. Our validated approach will accelerate the pace of outcomes-oriented communication research and identify effective communication strategies linked to healthy eating. These findings will be used to tailor interventions and public health messages and develop automated eCoaching. This research will use cutting edge computer science technology – machine learning-based classification models – to automate communication coding, a resource-intensive qualitative analysis process, and identify key communication strategies used by eCoaches linked to increased fruit and vegetable (FV) intake among young adults age 21-30. Identifying communication strategies linked to increased FV intake will identify empirically derived communication techniques that can be used to tailor interventions and health promotion messages to more effectively promote behavior change in this age group.

"Telehealth Intervention for Improved Blood Pressure Control with Targeted Incentives: Using New Technologies and Insights From Behavioral Economics to Increase the Effectiveness of Behavioral Change PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Hypertension, or sustained systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 140 and 90 mm Hg or higher, is among the most frequently encountered conditions in primary care in the U.S. The estimated prevalence is 30% among all U.S. adults and increases with age to affect 65% of seniors. Hypertension is also the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, global mortality, and ranks third among the causes of disability. Treatment of hypertension is relatively straightforward, but patient adherence to long- term self-care strategies is problematically low. Three important behaviors that individuals can adhere to in order to help lower their BP are 1) Taking medications as prescribed by a physician, 2) Monitoring blood pressure at home, and 3) Limiting dietary sodium intake. Adherence to these behaviors is problematic and currently ranges from 25% to 50%; the current proposal is aimed at addressing the behavioral barriers for these three activities with the help of new technology. In particular, this STTR will develop and test an incentive program delivered through a telehealth app to increase adherence to prescribed BP control regimens, and precipitate reduction in BP. The target participants for the test are a vulnerable population of seniors with clinically diagnosed hypertension in the University of California - San Diego community. The product to be developed through this STTR is a telehealth app for patient smartphones, which incorporates financial and targeted incentives framed in a way that targets specific “mental accounts” to maximize the behavioral effectiveness of the intervention. The approach is to (1) Using focus group to construct an optimal incentive strategy to promote adherence to overcome behavioral barriers, support self-efficacy, and complement intrinsic motivators, and (2) Demonstrate feasibility of combining behavioral economics with state-of-the-art telehealth technology to deliver an optimal incentive strategy to the specific group of patients to promote adherence and reduce BP. The telehealth innovation centers on (a) Immediate delivery of reminder triggers and reinforcement to establish behaviors, (b) Employment of computer vision and artificial intelligence technologies to reduce time and effort costs of adherence, and finally (c) Support for remote monitoring of patient progress by health plans, providers and researchers. Phase II will test the efficacy of this approach in a larger and more diverse population within the UCSD Health system, additionally incorporating incentives for outcomes (e.g., achievement of BP < 140/90 mm Hg) to search for statistically and clinically significant improvements in blood pressure resulting from use of the app with the optimal incentives. Initial customers are health insurers and risk-bearing hospital systems (e.g. those with value-based reimbursement models), who are fiscally responsible for large numbers of patients with poorly controlled BP. PROJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nonadherence to treatment for high blood pressure in the aging population is an urgent public health concern that impacts individuals, families, and communities across the nation. The resulting health problems, including cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke, and death, and excessive spending, can be relieved through enhanced remote support for behavioral change using low-cost, scalable, and widely accessible telehealth tools, such as the product of this STTR. This approach has the potential to become widely adopted by health plans and providers that care for millions of seniors with poorly controlled hypertension to help these populations avoid complications and achieve better their health, as well as contribute to a better understanding of human behaviors and their impact on medical conditions.",Telehealth Intervention for Improved Blood Pressure Control with Targeted Incentives: Using New Technologies and Insights From Behavioral Economics to Increase the Effectiveness of Behavioral Change,9345760,R41AG056184,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Dietary Sodium', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Employment', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Planning', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Home Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Salvelinus', 'Self Care', 'Self Efficacy', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Sodium', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'beneficiary', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'commercial application', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'digital', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'dual eligible', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'usability']",NIA,"WELLTH, INC.",R41,2017,223743,0.008102296470972494
"Real-time video monitoring of falls in memory-care facilities for individuals with Alzheimer's and related dementias In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the  top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent  hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the  activities of daily living. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase  quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a  fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices  require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of  showing caregivers how falls occur.  Our goal is to deploy and demonstrate NestSense (also known as SafelyYou), an online fall detection  system with off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to passively detect falls for patients with AD and  related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL will confirm the fall  detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms. We will demonstrate it for 100  patients in 13 memory care facilities. Memory care facilities can select parameters that matter for  specific patients; for ex., some patients wake up frequently during the night while others should  be assisted when they attempt to leave the bed at night. It does not require action of individuals  / caregivers such as wearing a fall pendant and is therefore well-suited for individuals with ADRD.  We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence)  approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will  call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The human can monitor  several facilities at a given time.  This project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 13 memory care facilities,  recruited through our previous (IRB approved) pilot. The work will leverage our previous three  pilots. • Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting a proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. • Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility from  the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to  clinical benefits including a reduction of falls from 13 and 11 in the first 2 months to 2 in the  final month, due to video review with care staff. • Pilot 3 (ongoing): We demonstrated scalability and further acceptance by deploying the system in  13 facilities of the Carlton, Integral Senior Living, Pacifica and SRG networks, totaling 100  patients already monitored by our system (offline). The pilot proposed for this SBIR Phase I will translate the 100 cameras in these facilities into a  real-time fall detection system which will run online for 3 months with a 24/7 HIL support.  Compared to a 3-month baseline from the 100 cameras recording with the detection offline, we  hypothesize this real-time detection system will lead to a statistically significant reduction in  time on the ground after a fall, fall related hospitalizations, and length of hospital stay  following fall incidents based on results described in previous clinical trials with 150+  participants [8,14]. The proposed NestSense system uses off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to perform detection of  safety-critical events for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia patients in memory care  facilities. It does not rely on active use from the patients or caregivers (e.g., through wearing  any kind of device). The NestSense technology provides the first robust non-wearable fall detection  tuned specifically to the privacy-security tradeoffs of dementia care. It provides an answer to  today’s technology gaps (far from 100% reliability) by use of a Human-in-the Loop (HIL) paradigm to  enable a quick rollout of the technology. Following the acceptance of privacy safety tradeoffs of  our system by patients, family, and memory care staff in the Carlton, Integral Senior Living,  Pacifica and SRG networks, we have deployed the system in offline mode in 13 facilities of the  network, monitoring 100 patients. The research, implementation, and deployment work encompassed in  this SBIR Phase I will provide validation that the existing prototype can be rolled out to a proof  of concept, operational in real-time mode, with HIL, to reduce fall-related hospitalizations and  time spent on the ground. The pilot follows 3 previous pilots, the most recent of which deploys  cameras with these 100 patients in offline mode to study the effect on the fall rate of  occupational therapist review of fall video in memory care. This study will translate those cameras  into a real-time fall (online) detection system which will run online for 3 months with a 24/7 HIL  support. Compared to a 3-month baseline from the cameras recording with the detection offline, we  hypothesize this real-time detection system will lead to a statistically significant reduction in  time on the ground after a fall, fall related hospitalizations, and length of hospital stay  following fall incidents based on previous clinical trials with 100+ participants [8,14].",Real-time video monitoring of falls in memory-care facilities for individuals with Alzheimer's and related dementias,9465622,R43AG058354,"['Accidents', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Event', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Managed Care', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Privacy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Scheduling and Staffing', 'Security', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'falls', 'human-in-the-loop', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'success', 'time use', 'willingness']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R43,2017,150000,0.008945299731128493
"Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor Summary The principal goal of this proposal is to increase the accuracy and precision of a low-cost autorefraction device called the QuickSee, in order to improve access to refractive eye care for underserved populations. Poor vision due to a lack of eyeglasses is highly prevalent in low-resource settings throughout the world and significantly reduces quality of life, education, and productivity. The existing QuickSee only extracts the lower- order aberration information contained within a wavefront profile of the eye, to roughly estimate an eyeglass prescription. This proposal will further improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device by exploiting both the lower- and higher-order aberrations contained within the complete wavefront. To realize this goal, we will enroll 300 subjects (600 eyes) in Baltimore, MD, and will obtain subjective refraction and visual acuity (VA) measurements and will use machine learning on this large dataset of wavefront profiles to optimize the wavefront-to-refraction algorithm of the QuickSee device. The main output of this project will be a robust and improved-accuracy next-generation QuickSee device that will increase efficiency of and decrease the training requirements of eye care professionals, and potentially dispense refractive correction that provides similar or better VA than correction from an eye care professional. Successful completion of this work will be an important step towards dramatically improving eyeglass accessibility for health disparity populations in the USA and internationally in low-resource settings. Upon completion of this proposal, we will apply for a Phase II award proposing to work with Wilmer Eye Institute research faculty to assess widespread deployment of the next-generation QuickSee with minimally-trained personnel in order to accurately and reliably provide thousands of pairs of low-cost corrective eyeglasses to underserved communities. Project Narrative This project proposal seeks to develop a novel technology that will disruptively increase the accessibility of refractive eye care for health disparity populations in low-resource settings. Specifically, sophisticated algorithms will be developed that improve the accuracy of the QuickSee device so that it can improve the efficiency of and reduce the training barriers for eye care professionals, and potentially provide refractive correction without the need for refinement by a trained eye care professional. Our goal is to develop a low- cost, easy-to-use, scalable solution to increase accessibility to vision correction globally.","Improving access to vision correction for health disparity populations with the QuickSee: an accurate, low-cost, easy-to-use objective refractor",9312420,R43EB024299,"['Algorithms', 'Award', 'Baltimore', 'Brazil', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Educational Status', 'Enrollment', 'Eye', 'Eyeglasses', 'Feedback', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guatemala', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'India', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Machine Learning', 'Mali', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Optometrist', 'Output', 'Patient Schedules', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Pupil', 'Quality of life', 'Refractive Errors', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual Acuity', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'faculty research', 'health care disparity', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'lens', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'success', 'vector']",NIBIB,"PLENOPTIKA, INC.",R43,2017,200225,0.004665077303136642
"Activity-Aware Prompting to Improve Medication Adherence in Heart Failure Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing intelligent technologies that aid with health monitoring and intervention. Our immediate objective is to design, evaluate and validate machine learning-based software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide activity-aware medicine reminder interventions and provide insights on intervention timings that yield successful compliance. We hypothesize that many individuals with needs for medicine intervention can be more compliant with their medicine regimen if prompts are provided at the right times and in the right context. We plan to accomplish these objectives by 1) enhancing and validating software algorithms that recognize daily activities and activity transitions, 2) developing and validating activity-aware medicine prompting interventions for mobile devices, and 3) designing technologies to analyze medicine reminder successes and failures. We are well positioned to significantly advance the clinical translation of mobile device-based medicine reminders for use by heart failure patients. The proposed work represents a natural extension of our prior research and is innovative because it will partner real-time methodologies for validation and algorithmic development with smart phone data, utilize novel activity discovery algorithms, and employ activity recognition and prediction algorithms in the development of activity-aware prompting.

"Integrated Model of Palliative and Primary Care in Seriously Ill Older Adults Project Summary Background Palliative care is known to improve patient outcomes and reduce health care utiliza- tion in patients with cancer. But we know little on how to deliver palliative care to the large and growing population of older patients with multiple chronic conditions. Palliative care clinicians are a scarce resource, so care must be targeted to the subset of patients who would benefit most: those at highest risk of near-term death. This is a major challenge outside of specific diseases with known trajectories. Clinicians struggle with prognosis, and current statistical models perform poorly. Aims We will use novel predictive modeling methods (`machine learning') to identify complex old- er patients at high risk of one-year mortality, drawing on our team's prior work in data analytics and machine learning. We will apply these methods to a diverse population of older patients with multi- ple chronic conditions, in a large academic primary care network. Building on our team's track rec- ord of successful clinical trials, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of palliative care inte- grated with primary care, targeting older patients at the highest predicted risk of death. We will as- sess impact on a range of measurable patient-reported outcomes and health care utilization. Study design We will develop a model to predict one-year mortality in primary care patients over 65, using a rich set of variables from electronic health records. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning models are highly accurate for predicting mortality out-of-sample, i.e., in patients the model has never seen. We will identify patients at the highest risk of death—who would benefit most from scarce palliative care resources—and approach them to participate in a randomized trial, comparing usual primary care to primary care integrated with palliative care. The intervention, a series of home-based visits by palliative care clinicians, will build a longitudinal relationship with the patient and primary care team. This strategy is designed specifically to meet the needs of older pa- tients, as well as busy primary care clinicians. We will power the study to detect changes in two primary outcomes: quality of life and care intensity, measured by hospital and emergency visits. Other outcomes include symptom burden, advanced care planning, hospice use, and mortality. Implications This project will generate the first evidence on a new model of palliative care for older adults with multiple chronic illnesses, delivered `upstream' in the disease trajectory. We will build the technical and clinical infrastructure needed to target palliative care interventions for older adults outside of specific disease-based programs. A successful trial would facilitate broader adop- tion of similar interventions for older adults, and fundamentally transform the scale and scope of palliative care efforts in this population. Project Narrative Despite major advances in palliative care for patients with specific diseases, we know little about how to deliver palliative interventions `upstream'—earlier in the disease trajectory for older adults with multiple chronic conditions. We will apply advanced predictive modeling techniques (`machine learning') to identify older patients in a primary care setting who would benefit most from palliative care: those whose complex interplay of chronic conditions puts them at high risk of near-term death. Building on our team's strong infrastructure for clinical trials in palliative care, we will enroll the highest-risk patients in a randomized controlled trial, comparing usual primary care to primary care integrated with palliative care.",Integrated Model of Palliative and Primary Care in Seriously Ill Older Adults,9565691,R56AG055728,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Area Under Curve', 'Awareness', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Geriatrics', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'SF-12', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical infrastructure', 'cost', 'design', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'falls', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'older patient', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'palliative', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'trial comparing']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R56,2017,382595,-0.038574419845328035
"Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system. This NCI K07 will provide a mentored research experience, giving me the opportunity to acquire new competencies in cancer health communication for behavior change, research design and statistical methods underlying clinical trial implementation and evaluation. I will adapt collectiv intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient ""profiles"" and then use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets. Such theory-based ""market segmentation has been effective in helping patients reach lifestyle goals. However, there is a natural limit in the ability of a rule-based system to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. Current CTHC have reached this limit, and I propose to go beyond. My first aim is to develop the Web 2.0 ""S4S"" recommender system. My second aim is to evaluate S4S within the context of a NCI funded web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org).

My comprehensive training also includes coursework, seminars, and conferences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A high priority research area identified by the NIH is to understand the role of different media in increasing consumer demand for and use of effective, individually oriented tobacco cessation treatments for diverse populations. Specifically, a research focus is on understanding how to best tailor interventions. Although effective, there is a natural limit in the ability of current rle-based tailoring systems to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time.

"All of Us, Wisconsin Our application for OT-PM-16-003, “One in a Million – Precision Medicine Initiative Wisconsin” represents the collaborative efforts of three fully integrated regional healthcare systems to form a virtual state-wide integrated delivery network. The application originates at the Marshfield Clinic Health System (MCHS), one of the most productive and earliest adopters of what has become Precision Medicine. The work of the MCHS has been cited by NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins as a model for the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI). To ensure comprehensive nearly state-wide coverage of participant health care, MCHS has partnered with the other academic integrated delivery networks in Wisconsin, (University of Wisconsin (UW) and Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW)), that together include 173 clinics, 13 hospitals, insurer partners and 5 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). The Blood Center of Wisconsin (BCW) also partners to operate state-wide mobile units of staff and equipment for blood collection that may be purposed for this effort. Through an independent agreement with Aurora Health, the electronic health records of participants recruited by academic and FQHC sites will be made available, ensuring nearly complete coverage of health care records across an entire state, with special emphasis on those populations that are traditionally the most underserved and understudied. The academic sites and FQHC partners have a long history of research cooperation and robust community engagement demonstrated by Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) ties, the Wisconsin Genome Initiative, reciprocal IRB arrangements, multiple joint grants and other collaborative studies. We have pioneered and implemented data sharing platforms and have demonstrated their usefulness with numerous high impact publications over many years. All three academic centers are leaders in the details of community engagement, recruitment, tracking, return of results and data sharing across various platforms in national and international consortia using large cohorts (e.g., MCHS’s 20,000 participant Personalized Medicine Research Project). A major innovation of this application is that it aligns the major healthcare systems of an entire state to more fully capture each participant’s data wherever participants get their health care. Indeed, 80% of all health care in Wisconsin is captured by our footprint. The State-wide catchment area also includes the oldest, sickest and poorest regions in the US and represent rural and urban areas, including African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans, all represented as community champions. Through the FQHC partners, the recruiting institutions will achieve the 40% African American, Hispanic and Native American participant rate, with long standing community engagement and history of successful recruitment, including Wisconsin’s 12 Native American Tribes. Lending active support are Community Champions and Community Advisory Boards. A second innovative approach will employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to optimize recruitment and retention processes. Our scientists have long collaborated on efforts to enhance the breadth and reliability of information extracted from the electronic health record (EHR), using a range of data to identify elements including family pedigrees or the occurrence of clinical events that are susceptible to unreliable coding. These efforts employed state-of-the-art methods including random forests, support vector machines and statistical relational learning, among others. These advanced computational methods will be used to predict those who are most likely to participate and which methods of approach are most effective. A third innovative approach is the planned use of mobile recruitment labs, previously successful with the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW). SHOW, began in 2008 provides a novel infrastructure for population health research recruitment, enabling engagement across the state, longitudinal follow-up of participants and community-specific studies. Key assets of SHOW are two mobile units staffed by research and healthcare professionals to facilitate on-site health studies in randomly selected or community-specific participants. SHOW is predicated on community engagement and the response rate has been outstanding (in one study more than 90% of ~4,000 participants consented to follow-up, DNA testing, or blood work). This is true across all racial/ethnic groups, including non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans. The fourth innovative approach is to work with our FQHC partners to recruit traditionally underserved populations. MCHS, UW and MCW will work with FQHC partners (Marshfield Family Health Center, Access Community Health Center, Milwaukee Health Services, Progressive Health Center and 16th Street Community Health Center). Importantly, we are ready to start. We have already informed and engaged our communities through press releases and newsletters. Processes are in place. Volunteers have already asked us to contact them. All the required personnel are trained and SOPs are in place to begin recruitment. We have a productive history of working with partners already funded for PMI cohort recruitment. For several years, we have worked closely (and published) with our colleagues at Northwestern and Columbia through the eMERGE Network and with the University of Pittsburgh through CTSA. Project Director Murray Brilliant has recently served as an advisor to the University of Arizona’s Precision Medicine Program. Thus, we are team-players who are ready, willing and able to be valuable collaborative partners in the effort to build a national engine to transform healthcare under PMI. n/a","All of Us, Wisconsin",9512099,OT2OD025286,"['African American', 'Agreement', 'Arizona', 'Award', 'Blood', 'Catchment Area', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Health Centers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consent', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services', 'Health Surveys', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'International', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'Newsletter', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'PMI cohort', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Press Releases', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tribes', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'genetic pedigree', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'response', 'rural area', 'urban area', 'virtual', 'volunteer']",OD,MARSHFIELD CLINIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION,OT2,2017,5360833,-0.003848103668616975
"Detecting and Monitoring Tardive Dyskinesia to Improve Patient Outcomes Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a common debilitating side effect of antipsychotic use. Characterized most notably by involuntary facial movements such as grimacing, involuntary lip, mouth, and tongue movements, and eye blinking, TD is difficult to treat and potentially irreversible. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are acutely aware of the impairment and disability experienced by patients who develop TD. Early detection of TD is critical so that appropriate interventions can be instituted. Unfortunately, despite professionals’ best efforts, it is often too late in the process and the involuntary movements are permanent. Antipsychotic prescriptions exceeded 50 million in 2011 and the reported incidence of TD is between 13% and 24%. Risk grows with advancing age, off-label uses, and chronic exposure to antipsychotics. Therefore, prevention and early detection are key to managing TD. However, current methods for monitoring patients require observation of patients at infrequent in-person visits or self-reporting by vigilant patients and their families. Therefore strong market potential exists for an automated detection system. This Phase I project proposes to leverage existing telepsychiatry and video interview data gathering technologies available commercially to efficiently collect and analyze two hundred 5-minute video interviews with individuals taking anti-psychotic medications. Half of the interviews will be with individuals living with diagnosed TD and the other without a diagnosis of TD. The participants in the study will be recruited to ensure an equal distribution of females and males as well as an ethnically and racially representative sample. The proposed data gathering strategy will provide the source material necessary to create a powerful supervised machine learning derived video and audio analysis tool to detect TD. The detection tool will be created using 80% of the collected video data as a training set and validated on the remaining 20% reserved as the control set. Based on industry experience with other supervised machine learning training sets and the amount of data to be collected, we set a goal of a 90% success rate in identifying TD positive and TD negative participants in the control set. Once the detection tool is complete the project will conclude by incorporating access to the tool into an existing smartphone app, iRxReminder, that is used for data gathering and monitoring of clinical trials. The iRxReminder system links patients directly to researchers and their electronic records. The modified app will be tested in the laboratory to ensure the interface can be easily used. In Phase II the iRxReminder system will be validated for use in supporting the self-management and symptom monitoring of medication taking by individuals living with chronic mental illnesses. Once feasibility is established, we propose a year-long RCT where participants will be monitored for early detection of TD along with goals for high adherence, improved control of symptoms and side effects, and more aggressive and frequent treatment responses by the healthcare team. A recent study reported that TD rates among newly treated elderly ranged from 7.2% for those taking Risperidone to 11.1% for those taking olanzapine after 2 years of treatment. Earlier meta-analyses estimate TD frequency in women to be 26.6% and in men 21.6%. Ethnically Chinese and Malaysian mental health patients were studied in Singapore and patients taking anti-psychotic medications were found to have TD in 40% and 29% of cases respectively. Regardless of prevalence, TD is a threat to patient adherence and quality of life. TD only remits in a minority of cases and can be permanent. With 50 million prescriptions for anti-psychotics written annually, more than 10 million persons living with a chronic mental illness are at risk of developing TD. There are likely over 6 million patients living with TD and the number of patients with TD is expected to grow with the aging population and increasing off- label use of antipsychotics. ",Detecting and Monitoring Tardive Dyskinesia to Improve Patient Outcomes,9410244,R43MH114763,"['Acute', 'Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Apple', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chinese People', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Science', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'FDA approved', 'Face', 'Family', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Involuntary Movements', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaysian', 'Medical Care Team', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Metoclopramide', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Monitoring Clinical Trials', 'Movement', 'Mydriasis', 'Neurologic', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient observation', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychiatrist', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risperidone', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Administered', 'Singapore', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Tardive Dyskinesia', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'Woman', 'aging population', 'base', 'chronic care model', 'cloud based', 'collaborative care', 'compliance behavior', 'disability', 'experience', 'field study', 'improved', 'interest', 'mHealth', 'male', 'medication compliance', 'men', 'new technology', 'olanzapine', 'racial and ethnic', 'severe mental illness', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"CREATIVE ACTION, LLC",R43,2017,260928,0.0007449797319905081
"Machine Learning for Health Outcomes and Quality of Care in Low-Income  Populations PROJECT SUMMARY: Life expectancy and other health outcomes in the United States are associated with income and socioeconomic status. Low-income populations have poorer health outcomes and, unlike high-income populations, outcomes also vary by geography. While these relationships have been described for decades in prior literature, the underlying mechanisms of these connections have not been identified. Understanding the determinants of such health disparities is critical to improving health outcomes and preventing disease. The impact of health insurance on health outcomes in low-income populations is unknown, as it has not been studied empirically on a national scale. The proposed research will be the first ever study to employ randomization of health plans in Medicaid, the government insurance program for individuals who lack resources to pay for health care. We will establish the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes in low-income populations. This will involve a novel data source containing enrollment and health care utilization information for the universe of low-income households in Massachusetts from 2006 to 2015. We are uniquely positioned to study the effect of Medicaid and type of Medicaid coverage as our data contains enrollees who were randomly assigned to plans and those who were not. These data are linked to important health outcomes, including cause of death, birth weight, and APGAR scores. We will additionally exploit our partial random assignment to examine effect modification by quality of care. Disparities exist in quality of care along income lines, and low-income populations tend to have lower quality scores. To accomplish these goals, we propose the creation of a nonparametric machine learning framework for generalizing results from experimental and quasi-experimental studies. This flexible robust methodology will be developed and tailored for our study of health disparities in order to generalize results from within-state studies to i) the full population of low-income individuals within a state and ii) populations of low-income individuals in other states. With average monthly Medicaid enrollment of over 55 million individuals across the country, this project will have significant broad impacts on low-income populations. Our findings and new analytic tools will provide foundational understanding of the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes among low-income populations, including any effect modification by quality of care. Unraveling the complicated relationships between insurance and health outcomes in low-income populations is an essential component toward improving these outcomes. The lack of randomization in most public health studies on disparities has contributed to diverging results and confusion around interpretation for health policy. The development of our machine learning framework for the generalizability of population health studies is innovative as it will revolutionize the ability of researchers to assess the effects of health exposures and interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Health outcomes and quality of care in low-income populations lag behind other groups, and the impact of health insurance on these disparities among low-income individuals is currently unknown. The goal of this proposal is to examine the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes in low-income populations with rigorous new tools in partially randomized data. This will be achieved by developing a novel machine learning framework for the generalizability of experimental and quasiexperimental studies, providing population health scientists with robust methodology to assess the effects of health interventions and exposures.",Machine Learning for Health Outcomes and Quality of Care in Low-Income  Populations,10240136,DP2MD012722,[' '],NIMHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DP2,2017,1164023,0.019893445634804777
"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,9278036,P01AG005842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health trends', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Income', 'India', 'Information Technology', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Obesity', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Social Values', 'Suicide', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data access', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service organization', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'opioid use', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2017,1755747,0.02605239415365435
"Developing Evidence- based User Centered Design and Implementation Guidelines to Improve Health Information Technology Usability ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to provide an evidence-base to better inform user centered design and implementation processes to improve health information technology (health IT) usability and safety. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-15-005). Utilizing a hybrid approach of expert manual review and machine learning techniques, specifically natural language processing, we will develop methods to rapidly analyze patient safety event data to determine which events are health IT related. We will then further categorize the health IT related safety events to determine which events could have been prevented by effective usability or implementation processes. Through this analysis we will be able to specify the usability and implementation processes that are critical to the safe and effective use of health IT. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health IT, and computer science. The proposed research is based on unique insights that our team gleaned from previous research that we conducted focusing on health IT vendor design and implementation processes. The application addresses fundamental aspects of the call for applications by providing an evidence base to improve health IT usability and safety to better inform policy and practice. This research effort is being conducted in partnership with a health IT vendor and a patient safety organization to ensure that our results align with vendor needs and to ensure the results are generalizable. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the critical user centered design and implementation processes to inform vendor and provider practice. Our research will also provide organizations like the Office of the National Coordinator with the information to better inform health IT policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health because it applies the science of human factors and data analytics to improve the usability and safety of health information technology and ultimately improve patient care.

"Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults with dementia are at increased risk of hospitalization when compared to adults without dementia of similar age and medical comorbidity. The increased risk of hospitalization extends to potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH) for conditions such as a urinary tract infection or asthma exacerbation, suggesting difficulty in outpatient management of patients with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia such as agitation or delusions likely account for a significant amount of this risk, given their prevalence and potential to cause caregiver distress. While there are effective interventions for patients and caregivers to reduce NPS, the profile of patients that could benefit the most from intervention, therefore reducing their hospitalization risk, is unknown. Through the coordinated program of mentorship, didactics, and research that I propose, I will develop the advanced skills to derive and apply administrative, claims, and clinical encounter data to prospectively identify those patients with dementia at highest risk for hospitalization. Development of this patient-level risk phenotype means that future interventions to reduce hospitalization can then be prospectively matched to the patients most likely to benefit, a development of critical public health importance given both financial and geriatric work force constraints.  Over the next four years, my short-term training goals include: (1) address gaps in my formal research training, specifically: (a) to conduct observational analyses using large-scale claims and administrative data; (b) to derive clinical data from the electronic health record using natural language processing; and (c) to apply advanced methods of data analysis for risk prediction; (2) train in presentations, manuscript writing, and grantsmanship that culminate with a R01 proposal; (3) establish further connections with potential collaborators in the University of Michigan (UM) Pepper Center and broader community of aging researchers, national geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry communities, and the Beeson Scholar community; and (4) engage in leadership development with an emphasis on skills to lead a research team, mentor junior investigators, and communicate findings in research and clinical care settings.  These short-term goals will be paired with research aims that focus on elaborating the PPH risk profile for patients with dementia. Such research objectives can only be achieved when: (1) full clinical characteristics are available for the at-risk (i.e., non-hospitalized) population, includig (2) NPS data, which are rarely captured in standard administrative claims data. These criteria are uniquely met in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system, which has one of the nation's most advanced electronic health records (EHR). Using a national dementia case repository (N=269,565) from which I will draw matched cases (patients with dementia + PPH) and controls (non-hospitalized patients with dementia). Aim 1 will use claims and administrative data to explore patient, treatment, and facility risk factors associated with PPH. Aim 2 will use natural language processing to derive NPS from EHR clinical encounter notes and then characterize the association of NPS with PPH. Using the risk phenotype described in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will develop logistic risk-prediction models to prospectively identify patients with dementia at highest risk for PPH. In subsequent grant proposals I will validate this risk- prediction model in other healthcare systems and prospectively pair the assessment tool with an evidence- based dementia intervention to reduce hospitalization.  My long-term career goals are to: (1) establish myself as independent investigator and national leader in geriatric mental health services research; (2) develop a programmatic line of funded health services research that develops risk-stratification models for late-life mental health and cognitive disorders; (3) translate knowledge from these research endeavors to improve the targeting and impact of future interventions research and health system delivery strategies; and (4) contribute broadly to the care of older adults by training and mentoring future clinical researchers in late-life mental health disorders. I am an Assistant Professor and geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, where I am also currently completing a MSc in Health and Healthcare Research, which provides an excellent background in health services research for clinicians. With this combination of clinical expertise and foundational training in health services research, I am uniquely qualified to undertake the advanced training activities outlined in this proposal, while UM affords the ideal environment in which to pursue this work. My primary mentor (Helen Kales, MD) and co-mentor (Frederic Blow, PhD) are national leaders in geriatric mental health who have used observational data to answer questions of national significance. My Advisory Panel includes Constantine Lyketsos, MD, MHS, an internationally-recognized expert in NPS and dementia care, and Kenneth Langa, MD, PhD, an internist, former Beeson Scholar, and renowned expert in using survey and secondary data to inform our understanding of dementia. Consultants include David Hanauer, MD, MS, an expert in bioinformatics and natural language processing, and Rodney Hayward, MD, a leader in risk assessment and intervention- targeting. My advisory team paired with resources of Michigan's Pepper Center, CTSA, and multi-disciplinary Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation make this the ideal environment in which to complete the proposed training activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although hospitalization can negatively impact patients with dementia, we know very little about the specific risk factors associated with the chance of being hospitalized. It is important to understand what contributes to this risk, such as the behavior changes that accompany dementia, in order to identify those patients and caregivers that could benefit most from an intervention to avoid or reduce hospitalization. Given the rapidly rising numbers of patients with dementia, reducing potentially preventable hospitalization could have an enormous impact on public health.",Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms,9291398,K08AG048321,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Assessment tool', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Bioinformatics', 'Capsicum', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Communities', 'Community Psychiatry', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'International', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kale - dietary', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Rural', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleeplessness', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'behavior change', 'career', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'geriatric mental health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'medication compliance', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2017,175103,0.003991681321174048
"Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation Project Summary Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a time-sensitive resuscitation procedure! essential for ventilation of newborns. It requires an unusually high level of skill due to the narrow airways, relatively large tongue, anterior glottic position, and low respiratory reserve of neonates (Bercic, Pocajt et al. 1978). Given the difficulty of the procedure and the high rate of complications in untrained hands, effective training is crucial. However, intubation success rates for pediatric residents are low under current resuscitation training programs and show little improvement between years 1-3 of residency (23-25%) (O'Donnell, Kamlin et al. 2006; Haubner, Barry et al. 2013). There is a pressing need to understand the factors that lead to poor training results and for innovative training modalities that can bridge the gap left by traditional training and thereby allow rapid skill acquisition. We hypothesize that current training and assessment methods suffer from 4 key weaknesses: (1) Poor realism: manikin and simulator-based training typically provide little variation in anatomy or difficulty level—key requirements for developing expertise (Dreyfus, Athanasiou et al. 1986)—and do not realistically model the look, feel, and motions of real tissue. (2) Subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods: training opportunities are limited by the availability of expert instructors. (3) Poor visualization: learners have poor knowledge about what went wrong and how to improve; they cannot see exactly what is going on inside the manikin or the patient and cannot directly monitor their actions relative to idealized, expert performance. (4) Assessment under artificially ideal conditions: assessments of ETI performance in classroom settings likely overestimate trainees' skill level because they do not mimic the stressors and distractions that are inherent in the real clinical environment. Technology-enhanced ETI simulators can resolve all of these key weaknesses: We have conducted preliminary work (Hahn, Li et al. 2016; Soghier, Li et al. 2014) on an augmented reality (AR (Azuma 1997)) manikin simulator driven by the motions of the trainee and physical manikin in real time that 1) provides a quantitative assessment of ETI technique and 2) allows the trainee to visualize the motion of the laryngoscope inside the manikin. The assessment score can provide feedback during the performance, as well as constitute part of the evaluation of the trainee's skill. Work under this proposal will build on this preliminary work. The specific aims are to: extend the current augmented reality (AR) manikin simulator to a virtual reality (VR) computer simulator and validate, extend and validate automated assessment and visualization algorithm for ETI, study training effectiveness by testing groups of pediatric residents across 3 years to quantify the effect of technology-enhanced methods relative to the current training regimen in terms of both intubation performance on simulators and clinical outcomes in patients, and assess performance under more realistic conditions. Project Narrative The current training and assessment of neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) suffers from key weaknesses of 1) poor realism of task simulators, 2) subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods, 3) poor visualization during simulation, and 4) assessment methods under artificially ideal conditions. This high-yield proposal will bridge the gap between training and clinical practice by using quantitative assessment tools and technology-enhanced simulation to improve ETI performance prior to patient care.",Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation,9288629,R01HD091179,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Hand', 'Imagery', 'Intratracheal Intubation', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatology', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Regimen', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'distraction', 'evidence base', 'haptics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'training opportunity', 'virtual reality']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,313412,-0.00773234161608754
"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care. The proposed project stresses the translation of basic computer science into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.",Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication,9233069,R01DC009834,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependency', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Movement', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Running', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visual evoked cortical potential', 'Vocabulary', 'Writing', 'acronyms', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive system', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'engineering design', 'experimental study', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'learning strategy', 'literacy', 'mindfulness meditation', 'multimodality', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'patient population', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'residence', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'skills', 'spelling', 'statistics', 'syntax', 'technology development', 'time interval', 'usability', 'vigilance']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,652111,-0.039039331938169775
"An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The candidate, Nishi Rawat, is a Critical Care physician and Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine at Johns Hopkins. Her goal is to become an independent investigator focused on advancing the field of quality improvement to improve the quality of health care delivered to Americans, while simultaneously reducing costs, with an emphasis on the application of information technology to evaluate performance, minimize waste and eliminate redundancies.  The candidate's preliminary work as a co-investigator for two collaboratives to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) suggests that there is a strong drive to eliminate preventable harms such as VAP, but weak available methodologies and resources to do so. There is a dire need for an effective and inexpensive methodology to track the delivery of evidence-based interventions for the purpose of quality improvement. The proposed research intends to fill this measurement gap. In this proposal, she evaluates the utility of the sensor approach for measuring and improving quality of care, focusing on VAP prevention intervention performance.  The aims propose: evaluate the utility of the sensor approach for measuring compliance with a VAP prevention intervention by comparing VAP process measure performance estimates captured by sensor technology to estimates obtained by traditional manual data collection (Aim 1); design and pilot a strategy to provide real-time feedback of sensor process measure compliance to providers (Aim 2); evaluate the impact of the sensor approach on VAP process measure compliance by comparing compliance before and after the implementation of the real-time feedback strategy (Aim 3). The proposed work could fundamentally change how healthcare monitors and reports important care interventions, and has the potential to make quality improvement more efficient, inexpensive and scalable.  The candidate is uniquely qualified to undertake the proposed work. She is double-board certified in Critical Care and Emergency Medicine, and has completed a Patient Safety and Quality fellowship. She has led multiple local quality improvement initiatives, and worked to decrease ICU costs as part of a national task force, and is currently co-investigator of large national infection prevention collaborative. It isher determination, enthusiasm and strong work ethic which have enabled her to balance these research activities with a heavy clinical commitment. She now needs protected time for research and career development to become an independent investigator.

"Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Patients often have poor access to screening and vaccination, and present in advanced stages, for which chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of failure and toxicity. Although intensifying chemotherapy can improve tumor control and survival, toxicity is often unacceptably high. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoRT are therefore needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue. In contrast, image-guided intensity-modulated RT (IG-IMRT) is a modern technique that maximizes target dose and minimizes normal tissue dose. Multiple studies have found that IG-IMRT can significantly reduce organ dose and reduce toxicity compared to standard RT. These studies support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT can permit delivery of more intensive chemotherapy. For example, gemcitabine, a potent radiosensitizer, has been found to improve survival for cervical cancer patients in randomized trials (Dueñas-Gonzalez et al.). However, the toxicity when delivered with standard RT is extreme (>80% grade 3-4 toxicity). Therefore, this regimen has not replaced cisplatin alone as the standard of care. In contrast, our research group has found that the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine was increased when given with IG-IMRT. A large international multi-institutional trial has also found lower rates of toxicity with IG-IMRT compare to standard chemoRT. These findings support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT, by reducing bowel and bone marrow dose, could permit delivery of more effective concurrent chemotherapy. If confirmed, this would have significant implications for many pelvic malignancies. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in a randomized trial.  CVM-1421 is an emerging NCI-funded randomized phase II trial within the NRG Oncology Cooperative Group that will test the hypothesis that adding concurrent triapine, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, to concurrent cisplatin and RT can improve outcomes in patients with locoregionally advanced cervix cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation. This trial presents a unique opportunity to study the effects of IG- IMRT on normal tissue toxicity, as it will be the first cooperative group trial to permit IG-IMRT in this population. This trial also presents an opportunity to study ways to improve IG-IMRT quality, as there has been considerable controversy in how to optimally design IG-IMRT plans, due to their increased complexity. The goal of our research is to study the effect of IG-IMRT on toxicity, quality of life, and treatment outcomes, under varying intensities of chemotherapy. We will also implement a novel technique called knowledge-based planning (KBP) in order to improve plan quality and achieve optimal IG-IMRT dose distributions. This research could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care for pelvic malignancies, and will lay groundwork for future studies testing novel technologies in clinical trial settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this study, we will test the hypothesis that image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) will reduce hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity compared to standard pelvic radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and cisplatin with or without triapine. We are in an optimal situation to ask this question because the randomized phase II trial that will set the background for our study is evaluating the efficacy of more intensive chemotherapy while allowing both IG-IMRT and standard radiation treatment techniques. It would be beneficial for clinicians and patients to know whether IG-IMRT will reduce toxicity and improve quality of life. Further, this study could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care.",Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421,9301295,R01CA197059,"['American', 'Anterior', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical Trials', 'DNA Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Gynecologic', 'Gynecology', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Population', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribonucleotide Reductase Inhibitor', 'Secondary to', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triapine', 'Vaccination', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative effectiveness', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'gastrointestinal', 'gemcitabine', 'image guided', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'new technology', 'novel', 'oncology', 'phase I trial', 'phase II trial', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiation effect', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,217388,-0.006615410711924849
"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9369218,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2017,170466,0.008534100407483463
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,9319536,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2017,449993,0.022786867662633728
"Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems V (CAHPS V) Consumers, providers and health care purchasers need high-quality information to help them compare and evaluate their health care options. The CAHPS V project will advance the AHRQ CAHPS mission of improving patients' experiences with health care by developing and evaluating strategies for survey measurement, reporting and quality improvement (QI). We propose a 5-year effort to advance the science and practice of patient experience assessment, continue innovation to ensure relevance to health service delivery and implement best survey practices, further the science of reporting, and evaluate CAHPS QI efforts. We will develop program communication strategies, and disseminate and promote use of CAHPS products. In particular, we will develop a survey to assess patient experiences with end-of-life care; develop new items to assess shared decision-making, care coordination, patient engagement, and patient safety; test alternatives to the standard CAHPS modes of data collection), explore the feasibility of administering a short-form survey dividing CG-CAHPS composites among respondents to reduce response burden, elicit stakeholder feedback about the value of different CAHPS supplement item sets, evaluate “The Your CAHPS Survey” that was designed to help users of the CAHPS surveys compile a survey tailed to their specific needs, and evaluate existing Spanish translations of CAHPS surveys. In addition, we will gather input from stakeholders on best practices for narrative data analysis, develop an approach for using automated Natural Language Processing for analyses of narratives, and construct an algorithm approach to select representative narratives that reflect and illustrate overall provider ratings. Finally, we will evaluate the contribution of patient narratives to quality improvement efforts in hospital care for children, characterize primary care practices use of the CG-CAHPS survey and patient-centered medical home items during PCMH transformation, assess the impact of pay- for-performance for care delivered by primary and specialty care safety net providers on CAHPS survey responses, explore the value of new shared decision-making, patient engagement, communication and patient safety items for QI and identify QI strategies that improve patient experience across various settings. We will also advance analytic methods for CAHPS data. The project team is well suited to achieving the study objectives given its prior accomplishments and established working relationships. The work is innovative and designed to facilitate the use of CAHPS surveys and improve response rates to them, enhance reporting and use of CAHPS survey data, and improve health care QI efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will advance public health by developing new CAHPS survey items for end-of-life care, shared decision-making, care coordination, patient engagement, and patient safety, promoting use of CAHPS surveys by implementing and evaluating an interactive database tool designed to assist with the assembly of CAHPS surveys, creating parsimonious variants of CAHPS surveys, evaluating alternative methods of data collection designed to improve response rates, enhancing the collection and use of patient narrative data in reports about health care, and assessing the impact of CAHPS surveys and reports on quality improvement efforts and patient experiences with care.",Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems V (CAHPS V),9491282,U18HS025920,[' '],AHRQ,RAND CORPORATION,U18,2017,1182529,0.025020625156221794
"Individualized Signal Processing Strategy :Phase II This project describes a novel approach to automate and individualize the signal processing strategy for hearing aids (HA) that can result in improved speech intelligibility in background noise, greater user satisfaction and acceptance for HAs, and reduce barriers to affordable hearing health care. The proposed Individualized Signal Processing Strategy (ISPS) is based on individual performance on categorical perception tasks for speech stimuli. This differs from traditional methods based on sophisticated gain models built upon average perception, performance, and preference data. The ability to determine one’s ISPS automatically, rapidly and remotely can result in dramatic cost-savings and greater accessibility to hearing health care for patients who cannot afford it or for those who lack easy access to the necessary expertise. These technical achievements have the potential to radically change HA service delivery models yet can be implemented within existing business models and in concert with current practitioners. The ISPS method effectively replaces target-based HA fitting (e.g. NAL-NL2) with individualized speech-based parameter adjustment. The proposed work follows successful completion of our pilot project and builds upon the research team’s prior research on novel fitting methods for cochlear implant (CI) devices recently acquired by Cochlear, Ltd. Following the successful implementation of ISPS and integration with commercial HA software in the pilot study, we demonstrated feasibility including a field study in which performance outcomes for the ISPS method were as good as a conventional HA fitting method and only took a fraction of the time, despite ISPS having no prior knowledge of patient characteristics and no audiogram. Successful maturation and commercialization of the ISPS technology in Phase II will address several barriers identified in the previous RFA-DC-12-004 including physical, infrastructure, and knowledge barriers (by allowing remote or self-fitting HAs), economic barriers (by reducing overall costs), and cultural barriers (by providing easy access to HA fitting for patients who tend to avoid professional help). This Phase II project will develop an operational ISPS method by (1) integrating ISPS with hardware/software systems of our industry partners, (2) refine and enhance the ISPS method to improve efficiency and effectiveness of fitting hearing instruments, (3) build support for the use of ISPS in multiple marketplaces, and (4) evaluate the technology through field trials in different service delivery environments by comparing outcomes with ISPS fitting to those achieved with traditional prescriptive gain fitting within the same subjects. Following successful demonstration of these objectives, a Phase III project will focus on the transition of the technology to support remote and self-fitting of hearing instruments.

"Leveraging Routine Clinical Materials and Mobile Technology to Assess CBT Quality Project Abstract: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been demonstrated to be effective for numerous presenting problems, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Several large mental health systems have invested heavily in programs to train their clinicians in CBTs, but relatively little attention has been devoted to the monitoring or promotion of CBT quality after training is complete. Identifying strategies to do so can facilitate research and training, and is critical to ensuring consumer access to high quality, evidence-based treatments. The lack of a scalable, effective, and efficient method of monitoring quality is a key barrier to efforts to promote high-quality implementation. Self-report fidelity assessments increase clinician and consumer burden and may not accurately reflect clinician skill or the intensity with which CBT interventions are delivered. Observation and expert ratings are time and resource intensive and unlikely to be feasible or affordable in large systems. To maximize the likelihood of broad implementation once effective strategies to monitor quality are established, it is essential that these strategies are feasible and acceptable in routine care contexts, leveraging information collected during routine care. To date, few monitoring strategies that do not involve observation, client/caregiver reports, or clinician self-reports have been tested. To address this critical implementation challenge, we propose to refine and evaluate a method of monitoring quality that is based on an evaluation of CBT worksheets that are completed in session. Because the worksheets were developed to implement core cognitive and behavioral elements and are embedded in CBTs across diagnostic categories, they may be used to elucidate the clinician’s ability to guide the client through CBT interventions in session. Preliminary research with this measure demonstrated high correlations between the measure and observer ratings of clinician competence, associations with subsequent symptom change, and high agreement between raters with differing levels of familiarity with CBT. Completion of the ratings based on worksheets requires only a small fraction of time required for session observation and ratings. This project will compare this novel strategy to observer ratings and adherence checklists that are embedded in clinical notes. Furthermore, it will compare the accuracy of worksheet data collected by mobile app to paper-form worksheets, and assess the feasibility and acceptability of these strategies. Because the core elements of CBT and its worksheets are common across many CBTs, this research has broad implications for monitoring fidelity to CBTs in a variety of mental health and healthcare systems and settings. This research will be conducted by a team of investigators with expertise in CBT, training, implementation, psychotherapy process and outcome research, psychometrics, longitudinal data analysis, mobile technologies and healthcare economics, with input from community partners and end-users. The resulting products have the potential to significantly improve efforts to monitor and ensure ongoing high quality implementation of CBT in routine care settings. Project Narrative: This project will compare two methods of assessing the quality of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that do not involve directly observing sessions, adherence checklists embedded in clinical notes, and rating the quality of worksheets that are completed with therapist guidance during sessions. It will also examine whether ratings of worksheets completed on a mobile app are reliable and valid quality measures. This information can inform strategies to monitor and enhance CBT quality, which can ultimately improve the quality of care and clinical outcomes.",Leveraging Routine Clinical Materials and Mobile Technology to Assess CBT Quality,9293065,R01MH112628,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Anxiety', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Familiarity', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Light', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Paper', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychotherapy', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'clinical material', 'cognitive enhancement', 'community setting', 'cost', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care economics', 'health economics', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel strategies', 'predict clinical outcome', 'programs', 'routine care', 'skills', 'standard measure', 'statistics']",NIMH,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2017,667956,0.02065942565272583
"Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks Project Summary/Abstract Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), particularly carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs), are a major cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Though studies have found multiple interventions addressing MDRO colonization and transmission to be effective at reducing HAIs, implementation has lagged due to questions regarding the most efficacious combination of interventions. As healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals, long-term care facilities, or outpatient surgical centers and clinics) are part of an interconnected healthcare network, evaluation of an intervention’s impact on transmission and infection must consider the dynamics across the healthcare system. To address remaining knowledge gaps regarding the most effective combinations of intervention strategies, we will build a multi-level model that spans from individual patients to regionally interconnected healthcare facilities. The resulting framework will provide hospital administrators and infection control experts with tools for quantifying individual patient risk factors for colonization and infection and for comparing the potential effectiveness of interventions to control HAIs. The aims of the project are: (1) to develop models to estimate the underlying prevalence and incidence of CROs and predict which patients are at highest risk for colonization and infection with CROs using clinical samples collected during the normal course of care; (2) to utilize hospital-level models to quantify the combinatorial relationship between, and marginal impact of, additional interventions to reduce HAIs; and (3) to build a regional model of a healthcare system to examine the effectiveness of interventions across institutions. Models will start with the patient at the center, utilizing the rich covariate data stored in electronic medical records to develop prediction models based on advanced machine learning. These prediction models will be translatable tools that can be directly incorporated into clinical care to assist clinicians in preventing HAIs. In addition, they will form the foundation of hospital-level models that will allow for detailed examinations of the effectiveness of different combinations of interventions. Hospital-level models will then be embedded in a network of healthcare facilities that accounts for the differing incentives faced by geographically dispersed facilities with variable demographic populations. These models will directly inform CDC guidelines about MDRO prevention and aid clinicians in reducing the risk of HAIs. Project Narrative The models developed through this proposal will improve understanding of how biological factors associated with the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) impact interventions to reduce hospital-associated infections (HAIs). This will aid predictions of patients’ risk for colonization and infection, as well as improve understanding of how interventions can most effectively be combined to reduce the likelihood that patients will suffer from these high-consequence pathogens.",Multi-level modeling to inform interventions for control of multidrug-resistant organisms within healthcare networks,9420097,U01CK000536,[' '],NCEZID,"CENTER/ DISEASE DYNAMICS, ECONOM/POLICY",U01,2017,649361,0.012125122615795025
"Detecting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Pediatric Emergency Department Care Using the PECARN Data Registry. Project Summary Understanding and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care are national priorities. There is growing evidence that such disparities extend to the care of children. Our overall goals are to Detect, Understand, and Reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the emergency care of children. Through this proposal we will have the capacity to utilize the AHRQ funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) Registry, a comprehensive clinical registry of all pediatric emergency department (ED) visits from 7 EDs to detect racial and ethnic disparities in the management of children seeking care in the ED. Once we detect the magnitude of racial and ethnic disparities in health care provision, we can then seek to understand why such disparities exist, which can then inform interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity. Through rigorous evaluation and use of multicenter comprehensive clinical data, this proposal will provide critical evidence and lay the framework for the next steps of our research mission - to develop and test interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of pediatric emergency care. Project Narrative Eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of health services is a national priority. Since the emergency department (ED) is universally available for all children to access care, it is critically important to determine whether pediatric care in EDs is being delivered equitably. With this proposal, we intend to utilize the PECARN Registry, a large registry that contains comprehensive clinical data from all pediatric ED visits made to 7 EDs, to detect whether racial and ethnic disparities exist in health care delivery for children seeking care in the ED.

"Independent Exoskeleton-Use through Robust Stand-to-Sit Safety Project Summary/Abstract Innovative Design Labs (IDL) proposes to create a system for the sensing and control of stand-to-sit motions of a wearable bionics suit. Currently 5.6 million people in the US have impaired mobility from a number of different causes. The primary means of mobility for many of these patients is the wheelchair as it has been for most of the last 50 years. Despite all the benefits introduced by widespread use of the wheelchair, it remains a less than ideal mobility solution. Exoskeleton suits have the potential to empower individuals with impaired mobility with an alternative to wheelchairs that allows them to stand up and walk independently within their home and community has the potential to more fully reintegrate these individuals into society while also further improving their health and quality of life. For exoskeletons to gain acceptance in every-day independent home and community use, many control and safety related functionalities still need to be addressed. Our proposal seeks to address one of the gaps in allowing for independent use of exoskeletons in the home and community, namely, functionality to transition from standing to sitting in a safe manner. The proposed work will provide exoskeleton users with the new ability to independently sit down without assistance and confidence in being able to do so without falling and risking possible injuries. It aims to significantly change the way exoskeletons work thereby facilitating their adoption into the market and directly impacting the lives of individuals with disabilities. Project Narrative Exoskeletons can provide patients with SCI, stroke, and other types of impaired mobility access to extended duration, gravity dependent ambulation that can directly combat the risks associated with physical deconditioning. There are benefits for exoskeleton-use to gain widespread acceptance in every-day, independent home and community settings. Currently, exoskeletons are not approved for independent-use because functionalities like transferring from standing-to-sitting requires continuous assistance from caregivers.",Independent Exoskeleton-Use through Robust Stand-to-Sit Safety,9409715,R44AG057267,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bionics', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Chicago', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fall injury', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Height', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Letters', 'Mechanics', 'Metric System', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'blind', 'combat', 'community setting', 'critical period', 'deconditioning', 'design', 'exoskeleton', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'human study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation technology', 'robot exoskeleton']",NIA,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R44,2017,653843,-0.013555153590441522
"Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management Project Summary/Abstract Advanced Medical Electronics Corporation and our partners propose to develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) system for persons with dementia (PWD),(mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, or other dementias), who are living in assisted living facilities. The proposed system uses Augmented Intelligence (AI) to communicate with the PWD in natural language. The system's goals are three-fold. First, the system helps PWD transition from living in their homes to ALFs by fostering relationships and conveying schedules. Second, the system enables PWD to age in place by addressing the challenges that often lead to an escalation of care (i.e., nursing homes). Third, the system engages PWD via activities such as storytelling and simple games. We will integrate the proposed SAR system with current assistive technology, which is based on the evidence from tested, personalized psychosocial approaches to deliver non-drug intervention to improve everyday behavior, function, and quality of life in PWD. A strong multi-disciplinary team of engineers, academic experts in SAR and PWD, and a commercialization partner has been assembled to achieve these goals. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is one of the costliest chronic diseases affecting an estimated 5.3 million Americans at a cost of $236 billion. Social assistive robots can be used to lessen levels of depression, loneliness, grief, fear, and frustration as dementia progresses improving mental health and quality of life. In addition to improved quality of life, persons with dementia may be able to extend the amount of time in assisted living before being forced to a much costlier higher level of care such as a nursing home.",Social Assistive Robot Interface for People with Alzheimer's and Other Dementias to Aid in Care Management,9466569,R44AG058337,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Companions', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fostering', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frustration', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Health', 'Hobbies', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information and Media', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Loneliness', 'Medical Electronics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Schedule', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Concepts', 'Social Development', 'Social isolation', 'South Carolina', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'body language', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'non-drug', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'robot interface', 'social', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIA,ADVANCED MEDICAL ELECTRONICS CORPORATION,R44,2017,349861,-0.00874277631306233
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions. Participants will also use the web-application to receive weekly To-Do lists of home exercises, which are provided to reinforce evidence-based strategies learned during treatment sessions and to facilitate implementation into the context of daily life. Aim 1 will determine the within-group response of the Experimental and Control treatments for individuals with PPA. Aim 2 will determine between group differences in treatment outcomes. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify and evaluate strategies that help individuals maximize their quality of life, and this study will help fulfill this need. In the absence of a cure for dementia, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies that maximize quality of life and independence. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions using a creative telepractice model for individuals with primary progressive aphasia (PPA).

While he has successfully been involved with epidemiologic and secondary data analysis, Dr. Yeh will pursue additional training in the areas of decision analysis, clinical trial conduct and implementation research, and bioinformatics - training which will allow him to translate outcomes research findings into novel interventions which improve patient health. The candidate's long-term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the applied outcomes research that has a broad impact on population health. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Dr. Laura Mauri (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and chief scientific officer of the Harvard Clinical Research Institute (HCRI), and Dr. Sharon- Lise Normand (Co-Mentor), Professor of Health Care Policy at HMS and Vice Chair of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute's Methods Committee. Both are internationally recognized leaders in their respective fields, and provide complementary expertise relevant to the research and training of the candidate. Dr. Mauri has an established track record of successfully leading practice-changing multicenter clinical trials in interventional cardiology, including the NIH/FDA/Industry-sponsored Dual Antiplatelet Theray (DAPT) Study. She has mentored several cardiovascular clinical investigators, including those that have received K awards and R01 funding. Dr. Normand has successfully mentored a large number of successful academic investigators, and is an internationally recognized expert in outcomes and comparative effectiveness research methods used in this proposal. The combined resources of several Harvard Medical School institutions, including HCRI, the Department of Health Care Policy, and the MGH Heart Center will support a rich and productive environment for Dr. Yeh's career development through a combination of didactic training, seminars, weekly research meetings, and conference presentations. Research: In the current era of invasive management of coronary artery disease, balancing the tradeoff between ischemic events and bleeding complications has become integral to decisions regarding the type and duration of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary intervention. In Aim 1, multivariable logistic regression will be used to develop models that can predict bleeding and ischemic events in patients after PCI depending on antiplatelet strategy, using data from the DAPT Study, the largest PCI clinical trial conducted to date, and the Massachusetts PCI Registry, a comprehensive longitudinal registry of patients undergoing coronary intervention. Models that can predict treatment benefit or harm associated with specific strategies will be developed. In Aim 2, decision analysis methods will be employed to enhance these models such that the treatment strategy which is predicted to maximize patient benefit can be identified for all patients, and associated uncertainty in this determination can be assessed. In Aim 3, these tools will be integrated into a novel software application that can execute multivariable risk predictions at the point of care within the MGH cardiac catheterization laboratory. These tools will be used as clinical decision aids, and tested in a prospective randomized clinical trial to determine whether such interventions can enhance clinical decision making. The research will demonstrate how the end products of outcomes research can be translated into innovative interventions that can ""personalize"" medical decisions and ultimately improve patient care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stenting of the heart arteries is one of the most commonly performed procedures in the US. Patients who have these procedures are at risk for having both bleeding and clot-related complications during the procedure as well as for months to years afterwards, which require the careful use of antiplatelet medications. This research will develop and assess the impact of tools that can be used by clinicians and patients to help inform the best use of antiplatelet medications after stenting of the heart arteries, such that bleeding and clotting risks associated with these procedures can be minimized for patients.",Balancing the Risks of Ischemia and Bleeding in Percutaneous Coronary Interventio,9061806,K23HL118138,"['Adverse event', 'Age', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Analysis', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Heart', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Insurance', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'London', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Population Intervention', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Procedures', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Schools', 'Stents', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'alternative treatment', 'analytical method', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical candidate', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'coronary angioplasty', 'design', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'patient registry', 'percutaneous coronary intervention', 'point of care', 'population health', 'professor', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'routine care', 'routine practice', 'skills', 'study population', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy', 'usability']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2017,164376,0.009679421352803627

"Novel Methods for Evaluation and Implementation of Behavioral Intervention Technologies for Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is projected to be a leading cause of burden of disease globally and in the United States. In the United States, in 2012 alone, an estimated 16 million adults aged 18 or older (7% of all adults) had at least one major depressive episode. While psychological treatments are effective at treating depression, the high prevalence of MDD makes it impossible to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) use technologies such as mobile phones to support behavior change to improve mental health, and have been shown to have similar effects to psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. With the growing number of mobile phone users, BIT is a viable and promising option for delivering psychotherapy. On the other hand, the current evaluation framework of new interventions is not adequate for evaluating and implementing BITs, because of the rapidly evolving BIT landscape and the complexity of the interventions. This research aims to develop and validate novel concepts and evaluation framework to address these two challenges in the dissemination and implementation of BITs in MDD patients in pragmatic settings. We plan to achieve this research goal in four steps. First, we will develop a new statistical design, called open-ended adaptive randomization (OAR) procedure, which will enable us to continuously evaluate BITs that enter and leave a care delivery system. The OAR also aims to improve quality of care given to the participating patients, by sequentially allocating patients away from inferior BITs based on the interim evidence during deployment. Second, we will develop a data analytical technique, called regularized Q-learning, which will enable us to perform variable selection in high-dimensional settings and retain only the important predictors of health outcomes in the learning model. While the original Q-learning is a cutting-edge technique originating from the computer science literature, the research will extend its capability to handle high-dimensional data and enrich the learning model by incorporating regularized regression. Third, we will prepare for the next implementation phase of the proposed methods, by calibrating the methods with computer simulations, creating an initial knowledge base by analyzing data from current randomized clinical trials, identifying partnerships with healthcare providers and app curation plaftorms. Fourth, we will advocate for the general implementation of the proposed methods by producing publications, building cognitive computing systems, and tracking the source of citation and adoption of the published results by the broader health research community. Our long-term goal is to enhance our capability of deploying complex interventions such as BITs to depressed patients in a personalized and evidence-based manner throughout the healthcare system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common, and imposes a high societal cost in terms of quality of life, work productivity, functional status, morbidity and mortality. The national healthcare system will not be able to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. With the growing number of smartphone use, behavioral intervention technologies have become a viable and scalable option to deliver psychotherapy to the population. This research proposes novel evaluation and implementation concepts and methods that aim to extend our capacity to adopt these technologies in an evidence-based manner.",Novel Methods for Evaluation and Implementation of Behavioral Intervention Technologies for Depression,9276137,R01MH109496,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Evidence based practice', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Inferior', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Science', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'burden of illness', 'care delivery', 'computer science', 'cost', 'depressed patient', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'efficacy study', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'functional status', 'high dimensionality', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'preference', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research data dissemination', 'sensor', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'statistics', 'technology development']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,396478,-0.010649766252945987
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.            ",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,9285614,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'learning strategy', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social cognitive theory', 'socioeconomics', 'vulnerable adolescent', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2017,747607,0.006281287093640313
"Avoidable Acute Care Use among Patients with Lupus PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Candace Feldman is an Instructor in Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy and the Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). Dr. Feldman has a longstanding passion to understand and reduce disparities in rheumatic diseases. Her research focuses on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in prevalence, access and outcomes among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Her 14 peer-reviewed original publications, 8 first author, and 2 early career development grants exemplify her track record and her commitment to this field. She holds a MPH degree and is pursuing a doctorate in social epidemiology from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her immediate goals are to learn and apply advanced health services research and qualitative methods to understand SLE-related avoidable acute care use to inform a future intervention. She will be guided by Dr. Costenbader, an established SLE epidemiologist, and an expert mentoring team. Dr. Feldman strives to apply rigorous methods to redesign healthcare delivery for vulnerable rheumatology patients. Environment: Dr. Feldman’s Division Chief ensures that >75% of her time will be protected for research and career development for the 5-year duration of this K23 award. She has financial support to supplement her salary and project-related expenses from the Division, the SCS, and her primary mentor’s funding. The BWH Lupus Center, co-directed by Dr. Costenbader, is the largest in New England. The research infrastructure established as part of the Center will enable Dr. Feldman to recruit patients. In addition, the SCS has extensive research infrastructure, which will continue to support her work. Dr. Feldman has access to Medicaid data under Dr. Costenbader’s Data Use Agreement with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and to Partners HealthCare electronic health records linked to claims data through the explicit support of Population Health Management. For her training, she will have access to courses and mentorship at HSPH, where she is a doctoral student, and through Harvard Medical School and the Harvard Catalyst Program. Research: Dr. Feldman will rigorously define SLE-related conditions that may result in avoidable acute care use (e.g. emergency department visits and hospitalizations). She will then examine rates and predictors of potentially avoidable use, and associated mortality and costs in two large, diverse datasets. She will learn and apply qualitative methods, including Photovoice, which will empower SLE patients to photograph their homes and communities, to explore the contribution of social determinants to avoidable care use. Dr. Feldman will hold focus groups of SLE patients, providers and administrators to design a rheumatology-based intervention to improve healthcare delivery for these high-utilizing, vulnerable SLE patients. Dr. Feldman will develop skills in rigorous mixed methods research. This project, and the training Dr. Feldman will gain, will position her for a R01 and for a career as an independent social epidemiology and patient-oriented investigator in rheumatology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lupus is a complex autoimmune disease, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and resulting in high acute care use, much of which could be prevented if patients had consistent access to high-quality outpatient care. There is a need to define and understand lupus-specific avoidable acute care use (emergency department visits and hospitalizations) and to identify those patients at highest risk. This study will inform the design of interventions aimed at optimizing outpatient care, preventing adverse outcomes, and reducing disparities among patients with complex, subspecialty-managed diseases.",Avoidable Acute Care Use among Patients with Lupus,9294418,K23AR071500,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Administrator', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cost Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delphi Technique', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Expenditure', 'Financial Support', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lupus', 'Mediating', 'Medicaid', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Social support', 'Structural Models', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'cost', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'doctoral student', 'ethnic minority population', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'instructor', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient subsets', 'population health', 'prevent', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'research and development', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'therapy design']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2017,178195,0.029555062286563412
"Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Thiopurine Monitoring in IBD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During routine medical care, enormous amounts of data are collected in the form of blood counts, blood chemistries, and other biomarkers. Despite this huge investment, remarkably little effort is applied to the interpretation of this data. Outside of medicine, a revolution in the analysis of large datasets has been driven by machine learning techniques in diverse applications ranging from identifying credit card fraud to making recommendations for book purchases. Despite the prominence of bioinformatics in the NIH Roadmap Initiative, these remarkable advances have had little impact on medical care. The broad, long-term objective of this proposal is to optimize, implement, test, and nationally distribute machine learning algorithms which will utilize patterns in large datasets to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in medicine.  We propose to use the monitoring of immune suppression during thiopurine therapy for inflammatory bowel disease as a demonstration case. A low therapeutic index makes it important to optimize thiopurine dosage for inflammatory bowel disease, and assays for serum metabolites are of limited benefit. Our preliminary data show that machine learning algorithms can be used to substantially improve prognostic accuracy and reduce costs in monitoring thiopurine use. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that there are patterns in the blood counts and blood chemistries associated with effective immune suppression by thiopurine medications which can be used to guide medication dosing. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on two observations. First, our preliminary data demonstrates that machine learning can identify significant changes in immune system activation through analysis of laboratory data. Second, published data suggests that the less accurate thiopurine metabolite tests are reasonably effective in guiding dose adjustment of thiopurines.  This application proposes the optimization, implementation and testing of a improved set of thiopurine monitoring algorithms, and the nationwide delivery of the optimized algorithms through the National Cancer Institute-supported LIDDEx (Laboratory Information Digital Data Exchange) architecture. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) use longitudinal clinical data and novel mathematical methods to improve the existing algorithm for clinical response to thiopurine therapy, using objective evidence of bowel inflammation as the gold standard; (2) prospectively test whether the thiopurine monitoring algorithms can accurately classify IBD patients who are immunosuppressed and patients who are non-adherent to thiopurine medications, and whether these algorithms can prospectively guide dosing of thiopurines in patients; and (3) implement these revised algorithms on a web server using the LIDDEx grid architecture to enable nationwide clinical use, and field test this implementation in the Ann Arbor VA IBD clinic. The proposed studies will directly impact patient care throughout the United States, and by demonstrating the effectiveness of this informatics architecture, spur further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care. This project addresses the NIH Roadmap Initiative goal of the application of innovations in bioinformatics to bedside clinical practice. The proposed studies will directly impact the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) throughout the United States. We expect that the successful demonstration of the effectiveness of the LIDDEx clinical informatics architecture will have a broad impact on clinical care beyond IBD by spurring further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care in a range of medical fields.",Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Thiopurine Monitoring in IBD,9059748,R01GM097117,"['Address', 'Advertisements', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Books', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Chemistry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Fraud', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunosuppression', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Intestines', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Electronics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Secure', 'Serum', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Index', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computer grid', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'digital', 'dosage', 'field study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'novel', 'prognostic', 'response', 'success', 'thiopurine']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,394118,0.011034412127445542
"Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colonoscopy is the predominant method for screening for colorectal cancer in the US. Yet, its effectiveness in screening is limited by variation in performance. For example, the rate at which physicians detect cancer precursors called adenomas during a colonoscopy has been shown to vary three-fold from one physician to another. A patient whose colonoscopy is performed by a physician with a low adenoma detection rate has a higher risk of subsequent colorectal cancer.  Our proposal centers on measuring, understanding, and improving colonoscopy quality. The major innovation of this work is to use natural language processing (NLP) to measure the quality of colonoscopy. NLP is a field of computer science in which a computer is trained to ""read"" text to identify relevant data We developed and validated the first NLP-based computer software application (C-QUAL) that analyzes colonoscopy and associated pathology reports. Our primary quality measure is adenoma detection rate because it is a common, validated measure that is linked to colorectal cancer incidence. However, we also use a number of secondary quality measures. We applied C-QUAL to almost 25,000 colonoscopy reports in one health system and found large variation in physician's performance on the quality measures. Building on this prior work, our goal is to use C-QUAL to measure colonoscopy quality across a spectrum of US practice environments, to understand what drives variation in colonoscopy quality, and to improve colonoscopy quality. In Aim 1, we propose to use the C-QUAL tool to measure performance in 4 diverse health care systems. This will be one of the largest assessments of the variation in adenoma detection rates and will span different geographic regions, payment systems, and practice settings. In Aim 2, we seek to understand why there is variation in quality. We will survey providers at the 4 health care systems about factors that might affect quality. We will link those survey results to the adenoma detection rates assessed in Aim 1 and look for key associations. It is assumed, but not proven, that providing feedback to physicians on colonoscopy quality will improve care. In Aim 3, we assess whether feedback to physicians does drive quality improvement and, building on Aim 2, explore which types of physicians may respond to feedback. Our proposal is the first to use this innovative method to measure colonoscopy quality and to use the quality scores to decrease the variation in colonoscopy performance. Together the results of the 3 aims are consistent with the NCI's focus on improving the quality of colorectal cancer screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research has shown that the quality of colonoscopy varies from physician to physician. It is important to address low quality because patients who see physicians with lower quality colonoscopies have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer in the future. To help address poor quality of colonoscopy, we propose to use a computer software program to measure colonoscopy quality, survey physicians to understand why there is variation in quality, and provide physician feedback to stimulate quality improvement.",Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing,9025565,R01CA168959,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cecum', 'Cessation of life', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'payment', 'programs', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2016,409330,0.005228044016163881
"Automated Coding of eCoaching Exchanges to Promote Healthier Eating Poor eating habits, particularly low fruit and vegetable intake, is a growing, serious public health concern, particularly among young adults age 21-30, referred to as Generation Y (GenY). GenY's poor dietary practices are associated with the onset of obesity and many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, as well as declines in predicted health status and life expectancy. Thus, there is a need to develop effective interventions to improve GenY's eating habits. MENU GenY is a computer-based intervention to encourage increased fruit and vegetable intake among GenY. A critical component of MENU GenY is personalized eCoaching. eCoaches use email to deliver motivation-enhancing coaching to encourage healthy eating, grounded in the principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI), an evidence-based communication technique to increase intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy for behavior change. The MI model posits that counselor's use of “MI-consistent” communication techniques are responsible for eliciting behavior change through patient “change talk” (i.e., statements about one's own desire, ability, reasons, need for or commitment to behavior change). A growing body of empirical evidence links change talk to behavior change, but research identifying the specific provider behaviors that elicit patient change talk is limited to specific populations (mainly adults who abuse substances and a couple studies of adolescents). Identifying specific communication strategies linked to behavior change and integrating these strategies into communication-based interventions (e.g., brief, motivation-enhancing interventions delivered in a variety of settings or public health initiatives) can increase these interventions' potency. However, a significant barrier to this research is the qualitative methods traditionally used to analyze the communication process which are resource-intensive, requiring an iterative process of human (subjective) interpretation of text. Rapidly developing computational technologies, specifically machine learning combined with classification models, offer a unique opportunity to accelerate this process. Our research group has recently applied machine learning-based data mining models to similar communication data. We automated a simple communication code scheme to characterize patient communication and achieved accuracy comparable to human coders. The goals of this study are to leverage innovative computer science machine learning and classification models to fully automate the communication coding process and link patterns in eCoach-patient communication to increases in fruit and vegetable intake. We propose a secondary analysis of data collected for a NICHD randomized clinical trial (R01 HD067314). The sample is 160 members of GenY drawn from both urban and rural settings (Detroit metropolitan area and rural Pennsylvania) with outcomes measured at baseline and 3 months. Our validated approach will accelerate the pace of outcomes-oriented communication research and identify effective communication strategies linked to healthy eating. These findings will be used to tailor interventions and public health messages and develop automated eCoaching. This research will use cutting edge computer science technology – machine learning-based classification models – to automate communication coding, a resource-intensive qualitative analysis process, and identify key communication strategies used by eCoaches linked to increased fruit and vegetable (FV) intake among young adults age 21-30. Identifying communication strategies linked to increased FV intake will identify empirically derived communication techniques that can be used to tailor interventions and health promotion messages to more effectively promote behavior change in this age group. The development of this computer science technology is the first step toward automating the eCoaching process.",Automated Coding of eCoaching Exchanges to Promote Healthier Eating,9181203,R21DK108071,"['21 year old', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communication Research', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Practices', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Mail', 'Food', 'Future Generations', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Healthy Eating', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Investigator-Initiated Research', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoking', 'Social Work', 'Son', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive task', 'communication behavior', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'digital', 'effective intervention', 'emerging adulthood', 'evidence base', 'fruits and vegetables', 'good diet', 'improved', 'inner city', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intrinsic motivation', 'member', 'metropolitan', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'new technology', 'point of care', 'primary outcome', 'public health intervention', 'rural area', 'satisfaction', 'sugar', 'sweetened beverage', 'young adult']",NIDDK,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,237377,-0.019567256863043187
"Activity-Aware Prompting to Improve Medication Adherence in Heart Failure Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing intelligent technologies that aid with health monitoring and intervention. Our immediate objective is to design, evaluate and validate machine learning-based software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide activity-aware medicine reminder interventions and provide insights on intervention timings that yield successful compliance. We hypothesize that many individuals with needs for medicine intervention can be more compliant with their medicine regimen if prompts are provided at the right times and in the right context. We plan to accomplish these objectives by 1) enhancing and validating software algorithms that recognize daily activities and activity transitions, 2) developing and validating activity-aware medicine prompting interventions for mobile devices, and 3) designing technologies to analyze medicine reminder successes and failures. We are well positioned to significantly advance the clinical translation of mobile device-based medicine reminders for use by heart failure patients. The proposed work represents a natural extension of our prior research and is innovative because it will partner real-time methodologies for validation and algorithmic development with smart phone data, utilize novel activity discovery algorithms, and employ activity recognition and prediction algorithms in the development of activity-aware prompting.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing intelligent technologies that aid with health monitoring and intervention.

"Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system. This NCI K07 will provide a mentored research experience, giving me the opportunity to acquire new competencies in cancer health communication for behavior change, research design and statistical methods underlying clinical trial implementation and evaluation. I will adapt collectiv intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient ""profiles"" and then use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets. Such theory-based ""market segmentation has been effective in helping patients reach lifestyle goals. However, there is a natural limit in the ability of a rule-based system to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. Current CTHC have reached this limit, and I propose to go beyond. My first aim is to develop the Web 2.0 ""S4S"" recommender system. My second aim is to evaluate S4S within the context of a NCI funded web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org). In my efforts, I will guided by my primary mentor (Dr. Houston, MD MPH) and two other mentor teams: The Cancer Health Behavior and Communication Team (Stephenie Lemon, PhD and Kathleen Mazor, EdD), and the Clinical Trial Design and Analysis Team (Jeroan Allison, MD, MS and Arlene Ash, PhD). My comprehensive training also includes coursework, seminars, and conferences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A high priority research area identified by the NIH is to understand the role of different media in increasing consumer demand for and use of effective, individually oriented tobacco cessation treatments for diverse populations. Specifically, a research focus is on understanding how to best tailor interventions. Although effective, there is a natural limit in the ability of current rle-based tailoring systems to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time.

"Internet Support Groups: Isolating and Improving Pathways Towards Mental Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People facing serious health threats increasingly use the Internet to obtain information and support. Internet support groups (ISGs), online communities where people come together to exchange information and/or support, are an important resource for patients grappling with serious medical conditions. Participation in health-related ISGs has been associated with significant reductions in participant-reported depression, anxiety and other indicators of psychological distress. These groups offer great potential for interventions that are highly scalable and yet easily tailored to individual needs. Unfortunately many ISG members leave too soon to benefit. In addition, there is limited scientific understanding of the active ingredients underlying the benefits that ISGs confer among their members. The proposed research uses state-of-the art machine learning and automated language analysis techniques to assess the types of interactions in online health support groups that lead to improved psychosocial well-being and health-related quality of life and how these interactions develop. It also uses these technologies and insight from our empirical research to build, deploy, and evaluate interventions that improve the interactions in health-related Internet support groups. Our work has three major aims. In Aims 1 and 2, we will analyze data from two complementary Internet support groups to identify (a) the communication processes that sustain participant engagement in the group and (b) the communication processes through which peer-to-peer interactions improve participants' psychosocial outcomes. These datasets come from an ongoing naturalistic study of 4,400 cancer survivors and caregivers in ISGs hosted by the American Cancer Society (ACS) and from a soon-to-be-completed NIMH-funded randomized trial (MH093501) assessing the effectiveness of an ISG for depressed and anxious patients referred to the group by their primary care physicians. Both datasets include participant-level data on depression, anxiety, stress and other psychosocial outcomes and detailed server logs containing information on page views, time on site, and the content of communications between participants. In Aim 3, we will develop and pilot test interventions to encourage the communication processes identified as effective in Aims 1 and 2. We will test whether mood, satisfaction with interactions and engagement in the group increase following interventions that (a) increase participants' receipt of individualized support from others; (b) provide participants with opportunities to offer support to others; (c) facilitate participants' expression of emotions; and (d) help participants form relationships with similar peers. In a series of randomized experiments, we will examine how these interventions affect participants' communication behaviors as well as short-term engagement and satisfaction with their online interactions. Results from this project will facilitate the development of an R01 application for a randomized clinical trial testing the impact of personalized ISG interventions on the length of time participants continue to participate in ISGs and participants' depression, anxiety and other psychosocial outcomes as well as healthcare utilization. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will examine how social exchanges among members of online health support groups lead to improvements in participants' health-related quality of life. Our findings will clarify the mechanisms through which social support leads to improved health-related quality of life and the process by which support resources are produced. The automated techniques we use to measure the exchange of support resources will also be the basis for interventions designed to make these exchanges more efficient and effective by matching people seeking support with those who can offer the type of support they need.",Internet Support Groups: Isolating and Improving Pathways Towards Mental Health,9039666,R21MH106880,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caregivers', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Empirical Research', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Support Groups', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'communication behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'experience', 'group intervention', 'health care service utilization', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'insight', 'language processing', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'online community', 'peer', 'psychological distress', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'success', 'therapy design']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,192605,-0.009633566449832041
"InfoMediator: Weaving Clinical Expertise in Online Health Communities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic illness can be overwhelming to patients because it impacts many areas of their daily lives. Accordingly, many patients turn to online health support groups to get social support. In face-to-face patient support groups (F2F), health professional moderators provide clinical expertise within the context of peer-patients' sharing of experience. However, in online health community settings, because health professionals' time and resources are expensive, it is challenging to get health professionals' opinions for thousands of messages posted each day. To solve this problem, I propose to develop methods and techniques that maximize the use of already available clinical expertise online for online peer-patient conversation threads by developing a system, InfoMediator. The InfoMediator will semi-automatically weave health professionals' existing answers to patients' questions into peer-patient conversations by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques complemented by user feedback. As the career development component of this proposal, I deepen my skills and knowledge in NLP necessary for proposed work and patient education. As I develop the NLP techniques and knowledge in patient education, I and my mentors will develop methods and techniques that address weaving clinical expertise within peer-patient conversations by designing, implementing, and evaluating socio-technical aspects of the InfoMediator. The training opportunities provided by this NIH NLM K01 grant, together with the supportive research environment at Michigan State University, will help further extend my existing expertise in human-computer interaction, design, and health informatics to establish my independent informatics research program in patient-centered technologies. Focusing on persons with diabetes, the outcomes of the proposed research will help us understand how to empower persons with diabetes to improve self- efficacy and self-care, while increasing the quality of online health information environment. 8. Project Narrative Because health professionals' time and resources are expensive, it is challenging for online health communities to engage health professionals in thousands of peer-patient conversations in the same way that health professionals moderate patient conversations in face-to-face patient support groups.

"Developing Evidence- based User Centered Design and Implementation Guidelines to Improve Health Information Technology Usability ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to provide an evidence-base to better inform user centered design and implementation processes to improve health information technology (health IT) usability and safety. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-15-005). Utilizing a hybrid approach of expert manual review and machine learning techniques, specifically natural language processing, we will develop methods to rapidly analyze patient safety event data to determine which events are health IT related. We will then further categorize the health IT related safety events to determine which events could have been prevented by effective usability or implementation processes. Through this analysis we will be able to specify the usability and implementation processes that are critical to the safe and effective use of health IT. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health IT, and computer science. The proposed research is based on unique insights that our team gleaned from previous research that we conducted focusing on health IT vendor design and implementation processes. The application addresses fundamental aspects of the call for applications by providing an evidence base to improve health IT usability and safety to better inform policy and practice. This research effort is being conducted in partnership with a health IT vendor and a patient safety organization to ensure that our results align with vendor needs and to ensure the results are generalizable. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the critical user centered design and implementation processes to inform vendor and provider practice. Our research will also provide organizations like the Office of the National Coordinator with the information to better inform health IT policy.

"Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults with dementia are at increased risk of hospitalization when compared to adults without dementia of similar age and medical comorbidity. The increased risk of hospitalization extends to potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH) for conditions such as a urinary tract infection or asthma exacerbation, suggesting difficulty in outpatient management of patients with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia such as agitation or delusions likely account for a significant amount of this risk, given their prevalence and potential to cause caregiver distress. While there are effective interventions for patients and caregivers to reduce NPS, the profile of patients that could benefit the most from intervention, therefore reducing their hospitalization risk, is unknown. Through the coordinated program of mentorship, didactics, and research that I propose, I will develop the advanced skills to derive and apply administrative, claims, and clinical encounter data to prospectively identify those patients with dementia at highest risk for hospitalization. Development of this patient-level risk phenotype means that future interventions to reduce hospitalization can then be prospectively matched to the patients most likely to benefit, a development of critical public health importance given both financial and geriatric work force constraints.  Over the next four years, my short-term training goals include: (1) address gaps in my formal research training, specifically: (a) to conduct observational analyses using large-scale claims and administrative data; (b) to derive clinical data from the electronic health record using natural language processing; and (c) to apply advanced methods of data analysis for risk prediction; (2) train in presentations, manuscript writing, and grantsmanship that culminate with a R01 proposal; (3) establish further connections with potential collaborators in the University of Michigan (UM) Pepper Center and broader community of aging researchers, national geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry communities, and the Beeson Scholar community; and (4) engage in leadership development with an emphasis on skills to lead a research team, mentor junior investigators, and communicate findings in research and clinical care settings.  These short-term goals will be paired with research aims that focus on elaborating the PPH risk profile for patients with dementia. Such research objectives can only be achieved when: (1) full clinical characteristics are available for the at-risk (i.e., non-hospitalized) population, includig (2) NPS data, which are rarely captured in standard administrative claims data. These criteria are uniquely met in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system, which has one of the nation's most advanced electronic health records (EHR). Using a national dementia case repository (N=269,565) from which I will draw matched cases (patients with dementia + PPH) and controls (non-hospitalized patients with dementia). Aim 1 will use claims and administrative data to explore patient, treatment, and facility risk factors associated with PPH. Aim 2 will use natural language processing to derive NPS from EHR clinical encounter notes and then characterize the association of NPS with PPH. Using the risk phenotype described in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will develop logistic risk-prediction models to prospectively identify patients with dementia at highest risk for PPH. In subsequent grant proposals I will validate this risk- prediction model in other healthcare systems and prospectively pair the assessment tool with an evidence- based dementia intervention to reduce hospitalization.  My long-term career goals are to: (1) establish myself as independent investigator and national leader in geriatric mental health services research; (2) develop a programmatic line of funded health services research that develops risk-stratification models for late-life mental health and cognitive disorders; (3) translate knowledge from these research endeavors to improve the targeting and impact of future interventions research and health system delivery strategies; and (4) contribute broadly to the care of older adults by training and mentoring future clinical researchers in late-life mental health disorders. I am an Assistant Professor and geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, where I am also currently completing a MSc in Health and Healthcare Research, which provides an excellent background in health services research for clinicians. With this combination of clinical expertise and foundational training in health services research, I am uniquely qualified to undertake the advanced training activities outlined in this proposal, while UM affords the ideal environment in which to pursue this work. My primary mentor (Helen Kales, MD) and co-mentor (Frederic Blow, PhD) are national leaders in geriatric mental health who have used observational data to answer questions of national significance. My Advisory Panel includes Constantine Lyketsos, MD, MHS, an internationally-recognized expert in NPS and dementia care, and Kenneth Langa, MD, PhD, an internist, former Beeson Scholar, and renowned expert in using survey and secondary data to inform our understanding of dementia. Consultants include David Hanauer, MD, MS, an expert in bioinformatics and natural language processing, and Rodney Hayward, MD, a leader in risk assessment and intervention- targeting. My advisory team paired with resources of Michigan's Pepper Center, CTSA, and multi-disciplinary Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation make this the ideal environment in which to complete the proposed training activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although hospitalization can negatively impact patients with dementia, we know very little about the specific risk factors associated with the chance of being hospitalized. It is important to understand what contributes to this risk, such as the behavior changes that accompany dementia, in order to identify those patients and caregivers that could benefit most from an intervention to avoid or reduce hospitalization.

"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care. The proposed project stresses the translation of basic computer science into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.",Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication,9038348,R01DC009834,"['21 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependency', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Movement', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'P300 Event-Related Potentials', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Running', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visual evoked cortical potential', 'Vocabulary', 'Writing', 'acronyms', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive system', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'engineering design', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'learning strategy', 'literacy', 'meetings', 'mindfulness meditation', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'patient population', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'residence', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'skills', 'spelling', 'statistics', 'syntax', 'technology development', 'time interval', 'usability', 'vigilance']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,652362,-0.039039331938169775
"Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Patients often have poor access to screening and vaccination, and present in advanced stages, for which chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of failure and toxicity. Although intensifying chemotherapy can improve tumor control and survival, toxicity is often unacceptably high. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoRT are therefore needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue. In contrast, image-guided intensity-modulated RT (IG-IMRT) is a modern technique that maximizes target dose and minimizes normal tissue dose. Multiple studies have found that IG-IMRT can significantly reduce organ dose and reduce toxicity compared to standard RT. These studies support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT can permit delivery of more intensive chemotherapy. For example, gemcitabine, a potent radiosensitizer, has been found to improve survival for cervical cancer patients in randomized trials (Dueñas-Gonzalez et al.). However, the toxicity when delivered with standard RT is extreme (>80% grade 3-4 toxicity). Therefore, this regimen has not replaced cisplatin alone as the standard of care. In contrast, our research group has found that the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine was increased when given with IG-IMRT. A large international multi-institutional trial has also found lower rates of toxicity with IG-IMRT compare to standard chemoRT. These findings support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT, by reducing bowel and bone marrow dose, could permit delivery of more effective concurrent chemotherapy. If confirmed, this would have significant implications for many pelvic malignancies. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in a randomized trial.  CVM-1421 is an emerging NCI-funded randomized phase II trial within the NRG Oncology Cooperative Group that will test the hypothesis that adding concurrent triapine, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, to concurrent cisplatin and RT can improve outcomes in patients with locoregionally advanced cervix cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation. This trial presents a unique opportunity to study the effects of IG- IMRT on normal tissue toxicity, as it will be the first cooperative group trial to permit IG-IMRT in this population. This trial also presents an opportunity to study ways to improve IG-IMRT quality, as there has been considerable controversy in how to optimally design IG-IMRT plans, due to their increased complexity. The goal of our research is to study the effect of IG-IMRT on toxicity, quality of life, and treatment outcomes, under varying intensities of chemotherapy. We will also implement a novel technique called knowledge-based planning (KBP) in order to improve plan quality and achieve optimal IG-IMRT dose distributions. This research could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care for pelvic malignancies, and will lay groundwork for future studies testing novel technologies in clinical trial settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this study, we will test the hypothesis that image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) will reduce hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity compared to standard pelvic radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and cisplatin with or without triapine. We are in an optimal situation to ask this question because the randomized phase II trial that will set the background for our study is evaluating the efficacy of more intensive chemotherapy while allowing both IG-IMRT and standard radiation treatment techniques. It would be beneficial for clinicians and patients to know whether IG-IMRT will reduce toxicity and improve quality of life. Further, this study could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care.",Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421,9104120,R01CA197059,"['American', 'Anterior', 'Bone Marrow', 'Boxing', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical Trials', 'DNA Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Gynecologic', 'Health', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Modeling', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Population', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribonucleotide Reductase Inhibitor', 'Secondary to', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triapine', 'Vaccination', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative effectiveness', 'contrast imaging', 'design', 'gastrointestinal', 'gemcitabine', 'image guided', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'new technology', 'novel', 'oncology', 'phase I trial', 'phase II trial', 'radiation effect', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,253619,-0.006615410711924849
"Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The population of the United States, as in most developed nations, is aging and is doing so at an increasing rate. This change in demographics is having a dramatic effect on the nation's healthcare delivery system and the related public costs. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the cost of long-term care for the elderly will reach $207 billion in 2020 and $346 billion in 2040. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will amount to almost 60% of the federal budget. The strong predilection of most of the elderly, and their families, is to prefer long-term care delivery in the home rather than in the institutionalized setting. This has resulted in a massive shift of elderly care costs t unpaid family caregivers, and this cost is not reflected in the budget numbers provided above. However, the continuation of this shifting of elderly care costs to family members is not sustainable due to the decrease in birth rate and the increasing number of adults surviving to old age without living children. As a result there will be an increasingly urgent need for publicly funded support of elderly home-based care while, at the same time, an equally urgent need to control the spirally cost of this care. More efficient delivery of home-care services for the eldery can have a significant impact on controlling, or even reducing, the cost of long-term elderly care. However, in order to deliver this care cost-effectively, a technology-based infrastructure optimized for this purpose will be required. One means of achieving this goal is by developing innovative mobile technology solutions which can monitor and maintain the activity, health and safety, and thereby the independence, of the elderly within the home. Our working hypothesis in this proposal is that a properly designed, head-mounted, wearable-computing solution can bring unique and powerful capabilities to address the need for more effective and lower-cost elderly home monitoring. We propose to develop a highly compact, light-weight, innovative technology called the Head-mounted Activity Monitoring (HAM) System. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to develop an innovative, low cost, ubiquitous and easy to use hardware and software system designed to support the independent living of the elderly. This wearable computing system accomplishes this by facilitating remote activity and safety monitoring, and also supports communication and interaction between the elderly, their caregivers, friends and family members, thereby reducing social isolation.",Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track,9105328,R44AG046969,"['3D Print', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Behavior', 'Birth Rate', 'Breeding', 'Budgets', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ear', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eyeglasses', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Housing', 'Independent Living', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Social Security', 'Social isolation', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wearable Computer', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'care delivery', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'design', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care delivery', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light weight', 'mobile computing', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'trend', 'usability']",NIA,"GEN-9, INC.",R44,2016,456419,0.02372553263572063
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,9120230,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2016,425000,0.022786867662633728

"Balancing the Risks of Ischemia and Bleeding in Percutaneous Coronary Interventio DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this grant proposal is to develop and assess a system to enhance the rational and personalized application of antiplatelet therapy for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, or coronary angioplasty and stenting). This proposal describes a 5 year research and training program designed to provide the candidate, Robert Yeh, the necessary skills and experience to develop an independent academic research career in the conduct of translational cardiovascular outcomes research. Candidate: Dr. Yeh received an MSc in health policy from the London School of Economics, an MD from Harvard Medical School, and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (UCSF) and interventional cardiology (MGH). He is now a junior faculty member at the Massachusetts General Hospital with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. While he has successfully been involved with epidemiologic and secondary data analysis, Dr. Yeh will pursue additional training in the areas of decision analysis, clinical trial conduct and implementation research, and bioinformatics - training which will allow him to translate outcomes research findings into novel interventions which improve patient health. The candidate's long-term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the applied outcomes research that has a broad impact on population health. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Dr. Laura Mauri (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and chief scientific officer of the Harvard Clinical Research Institute (HCRI), and Dr. Sharon- Lise Normand (Co-Mentor), Professor of Health Care Policy at HMS and Vice Chair of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute's Methods Committee. Both are internationally recognized leaders in their respective fields, and provide complementary expertise relevant to the research and training of the candidate. Dr. Mauri has an established track record of successfully leading practice-changing multicenter clinical trials in interventional cardiology, including the NIH/FDA/Industry-sponsored Dual Antiplatelet Theray (DAPT) Study. She has mentored several cardiovascular clinical investigators, including those that have received K awards and R01 funding. Dr. Normand has successfully mentored a large number of successful academic investigators, and is an internationally recognized expert in outcomes and comparative effectiveness research methods used in this proposal. The combined resources of several Harvard Medical School institutions, including HCRI, the Department of Health Care Policy, and the MGH Heart Center will support a rich and productive environment for Dr. Yeh's career development through a combination of didactic training, seminars, weekly research meetings, and conference presentations. Research: In the current era of invasive management of coronary artery disease, balancing the tradeoff between ischemic events and bleeding complications has become integral to decisions regarding the type and duration of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary intervention. In Aim 1, multivariable logistic regression will be used to develop models that can predict bleeding and ischemic events in patients after PCI depending on antiplatelet strategy, using data from the DAPT Study, the largest PCI clinical trial conducted to date, and the Massachusetts PCI Registry, a comprehensive longitudinal registry of patients undergoing coronary intervention. Models that can predict treatment benefit or harm associated with specific strategies will be developed. In Aim 2, decision analysis methods will be employed to enhance these models such that the treatment strategy which is predicted to maximize patient benefit can be identified for all patients, and associated uncertainty in this determination can be assessed. In Aim 3, these tools will be integrated into a novel software application that can execute multivariable risk predictions at the point of care within the MGH cardiac catheterization laboratory. These tools will be used as clinical decision aids, and tested in a prospective randomized clinical trial to determine whether such interventions can enhance clinical decision making. The research will demonstrate how the end products of outcomes research can be translated into innovative interventions that can ""personalize"" medical decisions and ultimately improve patient care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stenting of the heart arteries is one of the most commonly performed procedures in the US. Patients who have these procedures are at risk for having both bleeding and clot-related complications during the procedure as well as for months to years afterwards, which require the careful use of antiplatelet medications. This research will develop and assess the impact of tools that can be used by clinicians and patients to help inform the best use of antiplatelet medications after stenting of the heart arteries, such that bleeding and clotting risks associated with these procedures can be minimized for patients.",Balancing the Risks of Ischemia and Bleeding in Percutaneous Coronary Interventio,9216363,K23HL118138,"['Accounting', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Analysis', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Heart', 'Hemorrhage', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Insurance', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'London', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Procedures', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Schools', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'alternative treatment', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'coronary angioplasty', 'design', 'effectiveness research', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'patient registry', 'percutaneous coronary intervention', 'point of care', 'population health', 'professor', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'routine care', 'routine practice', 'skills', 'study population', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy', 'usability']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2016,164376,0.009679421352803627
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.

"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.

"Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Thiopurine Monitoring in IBD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During routine medical care, enormous amounts of data are collected in the form of blood counts, blood chemistries, and other biomarkers. Despite this huge investment, remarkably little effort is applied to the interpretation of this data. Outside of medicine, a revolution in the analysis of large datasets has been driven by machine learning techniques in diverse applications ranging from identifying credit card fraud to making recommendations for book purchases. Despite the prominence of bioinformatics in the NIH Roadmap Initiative, these remarkable advances have had little impact on medical care. The broad, long-term objective of this proposal is to optimize, implement, test, and nationally distribute machine learning algorithms which will utilize patterns in large datasets to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in medicine.  We propose to use the monitoring of immune suppression during thiopurine therapy for inflammatory bowel disease as a demonstration case. A low therapeutic index makes it important to optimize thiopurine dosage for inflammatory bowel disease, and assays for serum metabolites are of limited benefit. Our preliminary data show that machine learning algorithms can be used to substantially improve prognostic accuracy and reduce costs in monitoring thiopurine use. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that there are patterns in the blood counts and blood chemistries associated with effective immune suppression by thiopurine medications which can be used to guide medication dosing. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on two observations. First, our preliminary data demonstrates that machine learning can identify significant changes in immune system activation through analysis of laboratory data. Second, published data suggests that the less accurate thiopurine metabolite tests are reasonably effective in guiding dose adjustment of thiopurines.  This application proposes the optimization, implementation and testing of a improved set of thiopurine monitoring algorithms, and the nationwide delivery of the optimized algorithms through the National Cancer Institute-supported LIDDEx (Laboratory Information Digital Data Exchange) architecture. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) use longitudinal clinical data and novel mathematical methods to improve the existing algorithm for clinical response to thiopurine therapy, using objective evidence of bowel inflammation as the gold standard; (2) prospectively test whether the thiopurine monitoring algorithms can accurately classify IBD patients who are immunosuppressed and patients who are non-adherent to thiopurine medications, and whether these algorithms can prospectively guide dosing of thiopurines in patients; and (3) implement these revised algorithms on a web server using the LIDDEx grid architecture to enable nationwide clinical use, and field test this implementation in the Ann Arbor VA IBD clinic. The proposed studies will directly impact patient care throughout the United States, and by demonstrating the effectiveness of this informatics architecture, spur further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care. This project addresses the NIH Roadmap Initiative goal of the application of innovations in bioinformatics to bedside clinical practice. The proposed studies will directly impact the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) throughout the United States. We expect that the successful demonstration of the effectiveness of the LIDDEx clinical informatics architecture will have a broad impact on clinical care beyond IBD by spurring further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care in a range of medical fields.",Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Thiopurine Monitoring in IBD,8841749,R01GM097117,"['Address', 'Advertisements', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Books', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Chemistry', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Laboratory Information Systems', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Fraud', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunosuppression', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Intestines', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Electronics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Secure', 'Serum', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Index', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cluster computing', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'digital', 'dosage', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'novel', 'prognostic', 'response', 'success', 'thiopurine']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,394118,0.011034412127445542
"Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colonoscopy is the predominant method for screening for colorectal cancer in the US. Yet, its effectiveness in screening is limited by variation in performance. For example, the rate at which physicians detect cancer precursors called adenomas during a colonoscopy has been shown to vary three-fold from one physician to another. A patient whose colonoscopy is performed by a physician with a low adenoma detection rate has a higher risk of subsequent colorectal cancer.  Our proposal centers on measuring, understanding, and improving colonoscopy quality. The major innovation of this work is to use natural language processing (NLP) to measure the quality of colonoscopy. NLP is a field of computer science in which a computer is trained to ""read"" text to identify relevant data We developed and validated the first NLP-based computer software application (C-QUAL) that analyzes colonoscopy and associated pathology reports. Our primary quality measure is adenoma detection rate because it is a common, validated measure that is linked to colorectal cancer incidence. However, we also use a number of secondary quality measures. We applied C-QUAL to almost 25,000 colonoscopy reports in one health system and found large variation in physician's performance on the quality measures. Building on this prior work, our goal is to use C-QUAL to measure colonoscopy quality across a spectrum of US practice environments, to understand what drives variation in colonoscopy quality, and to improve colonoscopy quality. In Aim 1, we propose to use the C-QUAL tool to measure performance in 4 diverse health care systems. This will be one of the largest assessments of the variation in adenoma detection rates and will span different geographic regions, payment systems, and practice settings. In Aim 2, we seek to understand why there is variation in quality. We will survey providers at the 4 health care systems about factors that might affect quality. We will link those survey results to the adenoma detection rates assessed in Aim 1 and look for key associations. It is assumed, but not proven, that providing feedback to physicians on colonoscopy quality will improve care. In Aim 3, we assess whether feedback to physicians does drive quality improvement and, building on Aim 2, explore which types of physicians may respond to feedback. Our proposal is the first to use this innovative method to measure colonoscopy quality and to use the quality scores to decrease the variation in colonoscopy performance. Together the results of the 3 aims are consistent with the NCI's focus on improving the quality of colorectal cancer screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research has shown that the quality of colonoscopy varies from physician to physician. It is important to address low quality because patients who see physicians with lower quality colonoscopies have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer in the future. To help address poor quality of colonoscopy, we propose to use a computer software program to measure colonoscopy quality, survey physicians to understand why there is variation in quality, and provide physician feedback to stimulate quality improvement.",Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing,8830936,R01CA168959,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cecum', 'Cessation of life', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'payment', 'programs', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2015,494533,0.005228044016163881
"Technology Application to Enhance Discharge Referral Decision Support DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decreasing readmissions through better discharge planning (DP) and transitional care is a national healthcare priority. RightCare Solutions has leveraged over 10 years of interdisciplinary academic research led by a nurse researcher, and through our highly successful phase one SBIR grant demonstrated market value for the D2S2 product and the technical expertise of our team. The D2S2 is a six-item decision support tool installed by RightCare Solutions in the hospital EHR to assist discharge planners to identify high-risk patients upon admission allowing time and focus to target appropriate transitional and post-acute care to prevent readmissions. We have achieved outstanding outcomes from our phase 1 award and are proposing further technological developments to enhance our commercial launch. The market potential for the D2S2 tool is significant since discharge decision support is estimated to be applicable to roughly 6,500 U.S. hospitals with a census that is 60% older adults equaling 14 million discharges per year. The phase 1 results indicate a significant impact on 30 and 60 day readmissions giving us strong evidence as to the value of the product. However, the results and our experience using the software indicate there is opportunity to enhance the product's accruacy and functionality. We propose to enhance our predictive accuracy through innovative data mining and machine learning techniques and to improve the functionality by electronically connecting the acute and post-acute care settings. Due to implementation in the three hospitals of the University of Pennsylvania Health System we have data on over 6,000 patients and through the continued live implementation we will accumulate data on over 25,000 patients by the start of the phase 2 grant. Using existing, and new data generated from continued operations, this proposed SBIR grant will advance the product in two major ways to enhance the commercial benefit to its users. Aim 1: Develop, test, and scale SMART capabilities, a dynamic process for improving prediction accuracy, by using hospital-specific and patient level characteristics (D2S2 variables and additional clinical and non-clinical characteristics) and modern data mining/machine learning techniques. AIM 2: Operationalize the D2S2 recommendations by electronically connecting high-risk patients with post-acute care (PAC) providers and stakeholders, known as CONNECT capabilities. Called a ""learning health system"" the end- product of this SBIR grant will provide continuous evaluation and improvement to the end-user measured against their goals. Our innovative design produces a closed-loop system that will use data from the D2S2 and hospital databases over time to ""get smarter."" Further, our enhanced product will link acute care to post-acute providers giving them advanced warning of patients who will shortly come to them for care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This decision support software identifies high-risk patients upon admission and alerts the clinicians in acute and post- acute care.

"Improving Adherence and Outcomes by Artificial Intelligence-Adapted Text Messages DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uncontrolled hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and many patients fail to take their antihypertensive medication as prescribed. We propose to use artificial intelligence (AI) to allow short message service (SMS or text messages) interventions to adapt to patients' adherence needs and substantially improve medication taking. The aims of the study are to: (1) develop AI methods for adaptive decision-making in human- centered environments and demonstrate the feasibility of the resulting AI-enhanced SMS medication adherence intervention, (2) demonstrate that the intervention can ""learn"" by adapting the SMS message stream according to patients' medication taking over time, and (3) examine potential intervention impact as measured by improvements in medication adherence and systolic blood pressures. We will recruit 100 patients with uncontrolled hypertension and antihypertensive medication non-adherence. Adherence and other covariates will be measured via surveys at baseline, 3- and 6 months; blood pressures will be measured at baseline and 6 months. Participants will be given an electronic pill-bottle adherence monitor. Participants will receive SMS messages designed to motivate antihypertensive medication adherence. Message content and frequency will adapt automatically using AI algorithms designed to automatically optimize expected pill bottle opening. For Aim 1, the first 25 patients will be enrolled to develop and test alternative RL algorithms and fine-tune the system parameters. For Aim 2, we will examine changes in the probability distribution over message-types and compare that distribution with patients' reasons for non-adherence reported at baseline. For Aim 3, we will examine changes in self-reported medication non-adherence and blood pressure and automatically-reported pill bottle openings. This pilot study will establish the feasibility and potential impact of this novel approach to mobile health messaging for self-management support. The results will be used to support an R01 application for a larger and more definitive trial of intervention impacts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Uncontrolled high blood pressure is a major cause of death and illness and many patients fail to take their blood pressure medications as prescribed. We propose to use an artificial intelligence (AI) computer system to send different types of text messages to patients. These messages will change over time to meet patients' adherence needs and improve medication taking and blood pressure.",Improving Adherence and Outcomes by Artificial Intelligence-Adapted Text Messages,8829789,R21HS022336,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2015,159322,0.009542457532469156
"Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system. This NCI K07 will provide a mentored research experience, giving me the opportunity to acquire new competencies in cancer health communication for behavior change, research design and statistical methods underlying clinical trial implementation and evaluation. I will adapt collectiv intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient ""profiles"" and then use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets. Such theory-based ""market segmentation has been effective in helping patients reach lifestyle goals. However, there is a natural limit in the ability of a rule-based system to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. Current CTHC have reached this limit, and I propose to go beyond. My first aim is to develop the Web 2.0 ""S4S"" recommender system. My second aim is to evaluate S4S within the context of a NCI funded web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org). In my efforts, I will guided by my primary mentor (Dr. Houston, MD MPH) and two other mentor teams: The Cancer Health Behavior and Communication Team (Stephenie Lemon, PhD and Kathleen Mazor, EdD), and the Clinical Trial Design and Analysis Team (Jeroan Allison, MD, MS and Arlene Ash, PhD). My comprehensive training also includes coursework, seminars, and conferences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A high priority research area identified by the NIH is to understand the role of different media in increasing consumer demand for and use of effective, individually oriented tobacco cessation treatments for diverse populations. Specifically, a research focus is on understanding how to best tailor interventions. Although effective, there is a natural limit in the ability of current rle-based tailoring systems to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. This NCI K07 will advance computer tailoring by adapting machine learning collective intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance the personal relevance of the health communication.",Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system,8899464,K07CA172677,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventable cancer cause', 'Randomized', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral construct', 'communication behavior', 'consumer demand', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'research study', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'symposium', 'theories', 'web services', 'web site']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K07,2015,140335,0.0031143894719690753
"Internet Support Groups: Isolating and Improving Pathways Towards Mental Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People facing serious health threats increasingly use the Internet to obtain information and support. Internet support groups (ISGs), online communities where people come together to exchange information and/or support, are an important resource for patients grappling with serious medical conditions. Participation in health-related ISGs has been associated with significant reductions in participant-reported depression, anxiety and other indicators of psychological distress. These groups offer great potential for interventions that are highly scalable and yet easily tailored to individual needs. Unfortunately many ISG members leave too soon to benefit. In addition, there is limited scientific understanding of the active ingredients underlying the benefits that ISGs confer among their members. The proposed research uses state-of-the art machine learning and automated language analysis techniques to assess the types of interactions in online health support groups that lead to improved psychosocial well-being and health-related quality of life and how these interactions develop. It also uses these technologies and insight from our empirical research to build, deploy, and evaluate interventions that improve the interactions in health-related Internet support groups. Our work has three major aims. In Aims 1 and 2, we will analyze data from two complementary Internet support groups to identify (a) the communication processes that sustain participant engagement in the group and (b) the communication processes through which peer-to-peer interactions improve participants' psychosocial outcomes. These datasets come from an ongoing naturalistic study of 4,400 cancer survivors and caregivers in ISGs hosted by the American Cancer Society (ACS) and from a soon-to-be-completed NIMH-funded randomized trial (MH093501) assessing the effectiveness of an ISG for depressed and anxious patients referred to the group by their primary care physicians. Both datasets include participant-level data on depression, anxiety, stress and other psychosocial outcomes and detailed server logs containing information on page views, time on site, and the content of communications between participants. In Aim 3, we will develop and pilot test interventions to encourage the communication processes identified as effective in Aims 1 and 2. We will test whether mood, satisfaction with interactions and engagement in the group increase following interventions that (a) increase participants' receipt of individualized support from others; (b) provide participants with opportunities to offer support to others; (c) facilitate participants' expression of emotions; and (d) help participants form relationships with similar peers. In a series of randomized experiments, we will examine how these interventions affect participants' communication behaviors as well as short-term engagement and satisfaction with their online interactions.

"InfoMediator: Weaving Clinical Expertise in Online Health Communities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic illness can be overwhelming to patients because it impacts many areas of their daily lives. Accordingly, many patients turn to online health support groups to get social support. In face-to-face patient support groups (F2F), health professional moderators provide clinical expertise within the context of peer-patients' sharing of experience. However, in online health community settings, because health professionals' time and resources are expensive, it is challenging to get health professionals' opinions for thousands of messages posted each day. To solve this problem, I propose to develop methods and techniques that maximize the use of already available clinical expertise online for online peer-patient conversation threads by developing a system, InfoMediator. The InfoMediator will semi-automatically weave health professionals' existing answers to patients' questions into peer-patient conversations by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques complemented by user feedback. As the career development component of this proposal, I deepen my skills and knowledge in NLP necessary for proposed work and patient education. As I develop the NLP techniques and knowledge in patient education, I and my mentors will develop methods and techniques that address weaving clinical expertise within peer-patient conversations by designing, implementing, and evaluating socio-technical aspects of the InfoMediator. The training opportunities provided by this NIH NLM K01 grant, together with the supportive research environment at Michigan State University, will help further extend my existing expertise in human-computer interaction, design, and health informatics to establish my independent informatics research program in patient-centered technologies. Focusing on persons with diabetes, the outcomes of the proposed research will help us understand how to empower persons with diabetes to improve self- efficacy and self-care, while increasing the quality of online health information environment. 8. Project Narrative Because health professionals' time and resources are expensive, it is challenging for online health communities to engage health professionals in thousands of peer-patient conversations in the same way that health professionals moderate patient conversations in face-to-face patient support groups. To address this challenge I propose developing methods and techniques that maximize the use of already available health professionals' expertise online for online health communities and help patients improve self-efficacy and self-care toward managing chronic disease.",InfoMediator: Weaving Clinical Expertise in Online Health Communities,8929297,K01LM011980,"['Address', 'Area', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Informatics', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Informatics', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Self Care', 'Self Efficacy', 'Social support', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Support Groups', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'community setting', 'computer human interaction', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'patient oriented', 'peer', 'programs', 'prototype', 'skills', 'user centered design']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K01,2015,154413,-0.013557507675427443
"Developing Evidence- based User Centered Design and Implementation Guidelines to Improve Health Information Technology Usability ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to provide an evidence-base to better inform user centered design and implementation processes to improve health information technology (health IT) usability and safety. The proposed research is in direct response to special emphasis notice (NOT-HS-15-005). Utilizing a hybrid approach of expert manual review and machine learning techniques, specifically natural language processing, we will develop methods to rapidly analyze patient safety event data to determine which events are health IT related. We will then further categorize the health IT related safety events to determine which events could have been prevented by effective usability or implementation processes. Through this analysis we will be able to specify the usability and implementation processes that are critical to the safe and effective use of health IT. This project utilizes the extensive expertise of the research team in human factors and safety science, health IT, and computer science. The proposed research is based on unique insights that our team gleaned from previous research that we conducted focusing on health IT vendor design and implementation processes. The application addresses fundamental aspects of the call for applications by providing an evidence base to improve health IT usability and safety to better inform policy and practice. This research effort is being conducted in partnership with a health IT vendor and a patient safety organization to ensure that our results align with vendor needs and to ensure the results are generalizable. Contributions from this research will include a fundamental understanding of the critical user centered design and implementation processes to inform vendor and provider practice. Our research will also provide organizations like the Office of the National Coordinator with the information to better inform health IT policy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health because it applies the science of human factors and data analytics to improve the usability and safety of health information technology and ultimately improve patient care.

"Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults with dementia are at increased risk of hospitalization when compared to adults without dementia of similar age and medical comorbidity. The increased risk of hospitalization extends to potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH) for conditions such as a urinary tract infection or asthma exacerbation, suggesting difficulty in outpatient management of patients with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia such as agitation or delusions likely account for a significant amount of this risk, given their prevalence and potential to cause caregiver distress. While there are effective interventions for patients and caregivers to reduce NPS, the profile of patients that could benefit the most from intervention, therefore reducing their hospitalization risk, is unknown. Through the coordinated program of mentorship, didactics, and research that I propose, I will develop the advanced skills to derive and apply administrative, claims, and clinical encounter data to prospectively identify those patients with dementia at highest risk for hospitalization. Development of this patient-level risk phenotype means that future interventions to reduce hospitalization can then be prospectively matched to the patients most likely to benefit, a development of critical public health importance given both financial and geriatric work force constraints.  Over the next four years, my short-term training goals include: (1) address gaps in my formal research training, specifically: (a) to conduct observational analyses using large-scale claims and administrative data; (b) to derive clinical data from the electronic health record using natural language processing; and (c) to apply advanced methods of data analysis for risk prediction; (2) train in presentations, manuscript writing, and grantsmanship that culminate with a R01 proposal; (3) establish further connections with potential collaborators in the University of Michigan (UM) Pepper Center and broader community of aging researchers, national geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry communities, and the Beeson Scholar community; and (4) engage in leadership development with an emphasis on skills to lead a research team, mentor junior investigators, and communicate findings in research and clinical care settings.  These short-term goals will be paired with research aims that focus on elaborating the PPH risk profile for patients with dementia. Such research objectives can only be achieved when: (1) full clinical characteristics are available for the at-risk (i.e., non-hospitalized) population, includig (2) NPS data, which are rarely captured in standard administrative claims data. These criteria are uniquely met in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system, which has one of the nation's most advanced electronic health records (EHR). Using a national dementia case repository (N=269,565) from which I will draw matched cases (patients with dementia + PPH) and controls (non-hospitalized patients with dementia). Aim 1 will use claims and administrative data to explore patient, treatment, and facility risk factors associated with PPH. Aim 2 will use natural language processing to derive NPS from EHR clinical encounter notes and then characterize the association of NPS with PPH. Using the risk phenotype described in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will develop logistic risk-prediction models to prospectively identify patients with dementia at highest risk for PPH. In subsequent grant proposals I will validate this risk- prediction model in other healthcare systems and prospectively pair the assessment tool with an evidence- based dementia intervention to reduce hospitalization.  My long-term career goals are to: (1) establish myself as independent investigator and national leader in geriatric mental health services research; (2) develop a programmatic line of funded health services research that develops risk-stratification models for late-life mental health and cognitive disorders; (3) translate knowledge from these research endeavors to improve the targeting and impact of future interventions research and health system delivery strategies; and (4) contribute broadly to the care of older adults by training and mentoring future clinical researchers in late-life mental health disorders. I am an Assistant Professor and geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, where I am also currently completing a MSc in Health and Healthcare Research, which provides an excellent background in health services research for clinicians. With this combination of clinical expertise and foundational training in health services research, I am uniquely qualified to undertake the advanced training activities outlined in this proposal, while UM affords the ideal environment in which to pursue this work. My primary mentor (Helen Kales, MD) and co-mentor (Frederic Blow, PhD) are national leaders in geriatric mental health who have used observational data to answer questions of national significance. My Advisory Panel includes Constantine Lyketsos, MD, MHS, an internationally-recognized expert in NPS and dementia care, and Kenneth Langa, MD, PhD, an internist, former Beeson Scholar, and renowned expert in using survey and secondary data to inform our understanding of dementia. Consultants include David Hanauer, MD, MS, an expert in bioinformatics and natural language processing, and Rodney Hayward, MD, a leader in risk assessment and intervention- targeting. My advisory team paired with resources of Michigan's Pepper Center, CTSA, and multi-disciplinary Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation make this the ideal environment in which to complete the proposed training activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although hospitalization can negatively impact patients with dementia, we know very little about the specific risk factors associated with the chance of being hospitalized. It is important to understand what contributes to this risk, such as the behavior changes that accompany dementia, in order to identify those patients and caregivers that could benefit most from an intervention to avoid or reduce hospitalization.

"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care. The proposed project stresses the translation of basic computer science into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.                ",Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication,8876473,R01DC009834,"['21 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependency', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Movement', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'P300 Event-Related Potentials', 'Participant', 'Partner Communications', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Running', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visual evoked cortical potential', 'Vocabulary', 'Writing', 'acronyms', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive system', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'engineering design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'literacy', 'meetings', 'mindfulness meditation', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'patient population', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'residence', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'skills', 'spelling', 'statistics', 'syntax', 'technology development', 'time interval', 'usability', 'vigilance']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,665012,-0.039039331938169775
"An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The candidate, Nishi Rawat, is a Critical Care physician and Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine at Johns Hopkins. Her goal is to become an independent investigator focused on advancing the field of quality improvement to improve the quality of health care delivered to Americans, while simultaneously reducing costs, with an emphasis on the application of information technology to evaluate performance, minimize waste and eliminate redundancies.  The candidate's preliminary work as a co-investigator for two collaboratives to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) suggests that there is a strong drive to eliminate preventable harms such as VAP, but weak available methodologies and resources to do so. There is a dire need for an effective and inexpensive methodology to track the delivery of evidence-based interventions for the purpose of quality improvement. The proposed research intends to fill this measurement gap. In this proposal, she evaluates the utility of the sensor approach for measuring and improving quality of care, focusing on VAP prevention intervention performance.  The aims propose: evaluate the utility of the sensor approach for measuring compliance with a VAP prevention intervention by comparing VAP process measure performance estimates captured by sensor technology to estimates obtained by traditional manual data collection (Aim 1); design and pilot a strategy to provide real-time feedback of sensor process measure compliance to providers (Aim 2); evaluate the impact of the sensor approach on VAP process measure compliance by comparing compliance before and after the implementation of the real-time feedback strategy (Aim 3). The proposed work could fundamentally change how healthcare monitors and reports important care interventions, and has the potential to make quality improvement more efficient, inexpensive and scalable.  The candidate is uniquely qualified to undertake the proposed work. She is double-board certified in Critical Care and Emergency Medicine, and has completed a Patient Safety and Quality fellowship. She has led multiple local quality improvement initiatives, and worked to decrease ICU costs as part of a national task force, and is currently co-investigator of large national infection prevention collaborative. It isher determination, enthusiasm and strong work ethic which have enabled her to balance these research activities with a heavy clinical commitment. She now needs protected time for research and career development to become an independent investigator.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to improve quality of care by using low-cost, off-the-shelf, and non-invasive sensor technology to automate the measurement and feedback of data regarding whether patients receive an evidence-based intervention, patient mobilization, to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.             ",An evaluation of sensor technology to monitor and report compliance with an evidence-based intervention to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia,8967301,K23HL125982,"['Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Advisory Committees', 'American', 'Anesthesiology', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Focus Groups', 'Frustration', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human Engineering', 'Infection prevention', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physician Assistants', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Measures', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Provider', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of Care', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'State Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career development', 'cost', 'design', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multi-component intervention', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'preference', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'tool', 'ventilator-associated pneumonia', 'wasting']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,159057,0.03897726385605556
"Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The population of the United States, as in most developed nations, is aging and is doing so at an increasing rate. This change in demographics is having a dramatic effect on the nation's healthcare delivery system and the related public costs. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the cost of long-term care for the elderly will reach $207 billion in 2020 and $346 billion in 2040. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will amount to almost 60% of the federal budget. The strong predilection of most of the elderly, and their families, is to prefer long-term care delivery in the home rather than in the institutionalized setting. This has resulted in a massive shift of elderly care costs t unpaid family caregivers, and this cost is not reflected in the budget numbers provided above. However, the continuation of this shifting of elderly care costs to family members is not sustainable due to the decrease in birth rate and the increasing number of adults surviving to old age without living children. As a result there will be an increasingly urgent need for publicly funded support of elderly home-based care while, at the same time, an equally urgent need to control the spirally cost of this care. More efficient delivery of home-care services for the eldery can have a significant impact on controlling, or even reducing, the cost of long-term elderly care. However, in order to deliver this care cost-effectively, a technology-based infrastructure optimized for this purpose will be required. One means of achieving this goal is by developing innovative mobile technology solutions which can monitor and maintain the activity, health and safety, and thereby the independence, of the elderly within the home. Our working hypothesis in this proposal is that a properly designed, head-mounted, wearable-computing solution can bring unique and powerful capabilities to address the need for more effective and lower-cost elderly home monitoring. We propose to develop a highly compact, light-weight, innovative technology called the Head-mounted Activity Monitoring (HAM) System. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to develop an innovative, low cost, ubiquitous and easy to use hardware and software system designed to support the independent living of the elderly. This wearable computing system accomplishes this by facilitating remote activity and safety monitoring, and also supports communication and interaction between the elderly, their caregivers, friends and family members, thereby reducing social isolation.",Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track,9077885,R44AG046969,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Behavior', 'Birth Rate', 'Breeding', 'Budgets', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ear', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eyeglasses', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Housing', 'Independent Living', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Social Security', 'Social isolation', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wearable Computer', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'care delivery', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'design', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care delivery', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light weight', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'trend', 'usability']",NIA,"GEN-9, INC.",R44,2015,846167,0.02372553263572063
"Effectiveness of IG-IMRT for Locally Advanced Cervix Cancer on NRG Trial CVM-1421 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer is among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Patients often have poor access to screening and vaccination, and present in advanced stages, for which chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of failure and toxicity. Although intensifying chemotherapy can improve tumor control and survival, toxicity is often unacceptably high. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoRT are therefore needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue. In contrast, image-guided intensity-modulated RT (IG-IMRT) is a modern technique that maximizes target dose and minimizes normal tissue dose. Multiple studies have found that IG-IMRT can significantly reduce organ dose and reduce toxicity compared to standard RT. These studies support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT can permit delivery of more intensive chemotherapy. For example, gemcitabine, a potent radiosensitizer, has been found to improve survival for cervical cancer patients in randomized trials (Dueñas-Gonzalez et al.). However, the toxicity when delivered with standard RT is extreme (>80% grade 3-4 toxicity). Therefore, this regimen has not replaced cisplatin alone as the standard of care. In contrast, our research group has found that the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine was increased when given with IG-IMRT. A large international multi-institutional trial has also found lower rates of toxicity with IG-IMRT compare to standard chemoRT. These findings support the hypothesis that IG-IMRT, by reducing bowel and bone marrow dose, could permit delivery of more effective concurrent chemotherapy. If confirmed, this would have significant implications for many pelvic malignancies. However, this hypothesis has not been tested in a randomized trial.  CVM-1421 is an emerging NCI-funded randomized phase II trial within the NRG Oncology Cooperative Group that will test the hypothesis that adding concurrent triapine, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, to concurrent cisplatin and RT can improve outcomes in patients with locoregionally advanced cervix cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation. This trial presents a unique opportunity to study the effects of IG- IMRT on normal tissue toxicity, as it will be the first cooperative group trial to permit IG-IMRT in this population. This trial also presents an opportunity to study ways to improve IG-IMRT quality, as there has been considerable controversy in how to optimally design IG-IMRT plans, due to their increased complexity. The goal of our research is to study the effect of IG-IMRT on toxicity, quality of life, and treatment outcomes, under varying intensities of chemotherapy. We will also implement a novel technique called knowledge-based planning (KBP) in order to improve plan quality and achieve optimal IG-IMRT dose distributions. This research could help establish IG-IMRT as a new standard of care for pelvic malignancies, and will lay groundwork for future studies testing novel technologies in clinical trial settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this study, we will test the hypothesis that image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) will reduce hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity compared to standard pelvic radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and cisplatin with or without triapine. We are in an optimal situation to ask this question because the randomized phase II trial that will set the background for our study is evaluating the efficacy of more intensive chemotherapy while allowing both IG-IMRT and standard radiation treatment techniques. It would be beneficial for clinicians and patients to know whether IG-IMRT will reduce toxicity and improve quality of life.

"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors. In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel- Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher. An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher. In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD. Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models. This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training. To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills. In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients. Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder. Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially improve the care of these patients.","Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)",8897359,K23DK090304,"['Academy', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Charities', 'Chemistry', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'age related', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'career', 'computer program', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'screening', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'treatment as usual', 'trend']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,37402,0.010889301434663351
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,8915498,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2015,419993,0.022786867662633728
"Subgroup Analytics and Advanced Semantic Technologies to Enable Personalized Medicine ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): United States healthcare is embroiled in a crisis of inconsistent quality and overwhelming cost. Through two administrations, the national healthcare strategy has focused on using data and technology to control costs and improve care. Congress has enacted legislation to encourage measurement of quality, sharing of data, payment based on quality of care, and transparency within the healthcare system. While these goals are bipartisan and lofty, implementation requires both hard work from health systems and robust technology. Industry has developed technologies that incrementally further the national agenda, including electronic health records, computer assisted coding, and population health analytics. Each of these supports workflow within the healthcare system and improves profit margin for healthcare organizations. But, approaches that go beyond workflow, using data to better understand clinical care, are lacking. With newly available electronic health data and a massive increase in processing power, data-driven personalized medicine is just now becoming possible. It will require advanced semantic technologies to understand clinical care strategies that have been tried in the past, but that have unknown efficacy. It will pose informatics challenges in inferring inclusion criteria, interventions, and outcomes from incomplete and poorly structured data. It will require deep clinical understanding to run real-time pragmatic clinical trials based on real world data to understand complex patients. The goal, dependent on Phase I success, is to create the first commercial system to support healthcare in running real-time pragmatic clinical trials using full clinical data. This will augment the standard of care defined by randomized controlled trials to actually tailor therapy for those complex patients that account for the majority of healthcare spends, but for whom complexity precludes tailored randomized trials.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successful, the Phase I effort will represent a first step toward a revolutionary approach to leverage newly collected clinical data, rapidly evolving semantic technologies, and cutting edge clinical informatics to define best practices in healthcare. The overall project will target the complex patients that are poorly served by generalization of the randomized trial and currently account for the majority of healthcare spend. The goal is to leverage the national investment in clinical data to not just improve clinical workflow, but to actually transform medicine to achieve national goals of reducing costs and improving outcomes.            ",Subgroup Analytics and Advanced Semantic Technologies to Enable Personalized Medicine,8979535,R43LM012168,"['Accounting', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Congresses', 'Cost Control', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Label', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Semantics', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'World Health', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'health data', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'meetings', 'payment', 'personalized medicine', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'standard of care', 'success']",NLM,"VMT, INC.",R43,2015,224712,0.007311169524816219
"NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although cervical cancer is preventable, it still continues to be a leading cause of death. Following the evidence- based guidelines for cervical cancer prevention is challenging for healthcare providers, due to which many patients do not receive the optimal preventive care. Clinical decision support (CDS) systems can potentially improve the care delivery. However, the current CDS systems only identify patients overdue for screening, and do not suggest the optimal screening interval. Moreover they do not help with surveillance of patients with abnormal screening results. This is because the existing systems lack the capability to process free- text clinical reports that contain information needed for applying the guidelines. Hence there is a critical need for natural language processing (NLP)-enabled CDS systems that can utilize discrete as well as free-text patient information for enhancing the decision support. Our long-term goal is to improve healthcare delivery of cervical cancer prevention with guideline based reminders. The central hypothesis is that NLP- enabled CDS system will significantly improve the quality of care delivery for cervical cancer prevention. The rationale is that use of NLP will improve granularity of the guideline implementation, which will in-turn enhance care delivery. As preliminary work we have developed an NLP-enabled CDS system that automatically interprets the patient information from the electronic health record and applies the national guidelines to compute the optimal recommendation for screening and surveillance. We have performed validation of the system in a non-clinical setting.1 In this application we will proceed towards deployment of the system in the clinical setting, and will carry out studies for measuring the impact on the quality of care delivery. In ai one, we will validate the system in the clinical setting and will optimize its usability and workflw integration. In aim two, we will test the hypothesis that reminders from the NLP-enabled CDS system to primary care providers will improve the quality of care delivery, by performing a one year intervention control study across four sites of a primary care practice. In aim three, we will test the hypothesis that reminders to non-adherent high-risk patients will improve their surveillance rates, by performing a randomized intervention study for three months. In this study, care coordinators will utilize the CDS system for sending reminders to patients that are non-adherent and at high risk due to abnormal screenings. The main contribution of this project will be knowledge about the effectiveness of NLP in enhancing the impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This project is innovative because the CDS system will utilize NLP to generate screening reminders for normal patients and surveillance reminders for patients with abnormal findings. This is a major advancement over existing systems that can only identify patients for screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield knowledge about the effectiveness of natural language processing (NLP) to enhance impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This research will foster implementation of similar CDS systems across the nation for cervical cancer prevention and for other decision problems, which will improve the quality of healthcare delivery. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to AHRQ's mission to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.",NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance,8934087,R21HS022911,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2015,145229,-0.018816356739427876
"The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application from the Group Health (GH)/University of Washington (UW) eMERGE team proposes specific aims designed to advance integration of genomic data into clinical practice with a focus on clinical discovery and implementation on Mendelian forms of colorectal cancer and/or polyposis (CRC/P) and incidental findings in other actionable genes. Our aims will also allow us to address challenges involved in bringing genomic medicine into standard medical care. Our focus on CRC/P, and quantitative traits and incidental findings (IF) in other actionable genes represents a unique opportunity to move the field forward towards the goal of bringing genomic medicine into effective, standard medical practice in an everyday community practice setting. We have 3 Aims. Aim 1: Genomic medicine discovery and implementation focused on CRC/P, Triglycerides (TG), and neutrophil count (NPC). We proposed sequencing of 1000 CRC and 1000 Asian ancestry participants, to achieve sub- aims of understanding the genetic basis of CRC, TG, and NPC. Aim 2: Integrate genomic information into GH-wide clinical care and the EMR. We will develop intuitive, comprehensive reports to return CRC and other genes deemed actionable by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). We will incorporate stakeholder input and then to implement integrated processes and tools into an integrated delivery system with a focus on CRC/P and Long QT syndrome. We will develop and evaluate educational outreach and online resources. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of result return to patients and their families. We will implement a novel tool to increase family communication of CRC genetic results and evaluate the economic impact and cost effectiveness of this tool as well as of returning IFs. Completion of the work in this eMERGE III proposal will guarantee that the Seattle site remains an engaged and effective leader in the eMERGE network in support of NHGRI's mission to ensure that barriers to successful integration of genomic medicine in clinical care are overcome.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This eMERGE III proposal builds on past discoveries and research designed to translate genomic advances into clinical care involving clinicians, patients and families. This phase focuses on traits associated with preventable health concerns: colon cancer, triglycerides, and immunity. We address optimal methods to share information across families and whether other information found by genomic tests impact the care, health, and medical costs of individuals.                ","The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, Phase III",8965736,U01HG008657,"['Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amendment', 'American', 'Asians', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Community Practice', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Immunity', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Long QT Syndrome', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Other Genetics', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Developments', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Social Impacts', 'Solutions', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Triglycerides', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'economic outcome', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'outreach', 'polyposis', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait']",NHGRI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,U01,2015,859799,0.005945089794237677
"Balancing the Risks of Ischemia and Bleeding in Percutaneous Coronary Interventio DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this grant proposal is to develop and assess a system to enhance the rational and personalized application of antiplatelet therapy for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, or coronary angioplasty and stenting). This proposal describes a 5 year research and training program designed to provide the candidate, Robert Yeh, the necessary skills and experience to develop an independent academic research career in the conduct of translational cardiovascular outcomes research. Candidate: Dr. Yeh received an MSc in health policy from the London School of Economics, an MD from Harvard Medical School, and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (UCSF) and interventional cardiology (MGH). He is now a junior faculty member at the Massachusetts General Hospital with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. While he has successfully been involved with epidemiologic and secondary data analysis, Dr. Yeh will pursue additional training in the areas of decision analysis, clinical trial conduct and implementation research, and bioinformatics - training which will allow him to translate outcomes research findings into novel interventions which improve patient health. The candidate's long-term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the applied outcomes research that has a broad impact on population health. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Dr. Laura Mauri (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and chief scientific officer of the Harvard Clinical Research Institute (HCRI), and Dr. Sharon- Lise Normand (Co-Mentor), Professor of Health Care Policy at HMS and Vice Chair of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute's Methods Committee. Both are internationally recognized leaders in their respective fields, and provide complementary expertise relevant to the research and training of the candidate. Dr. Mauri has an established track record of successfully leading practice-changing multicenter clinical trials in interventional cardiology, including the NIH/FDA/Industry-sponsored Dual Antiplatelet Theray (DAPT) Study. She has mentored several cardiovascular clinical investigators, including those that have received K awards and R01 funding. Dr. Normand has successfully mentored a large number of successful academic investigators, and is an internationally recognized expert in outcomes and comparative effectiveness research methods used in this proposal. The combined resources of several Harvard Medical School institutions, including HCRI, the Department of Health Care Policy, and the MGH Heart Center will support a rich and productive environment for Dr. Yeh's career development through a combination of didactic training, seminars, weekly research meetings, and conference presentations. Research: In the current era of invasive management of coronary artery disease, balancing the tradeoff between ischemic events and bleeding complications has become integral to decisions regarding the type and duration of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary intervention. In Aim 1, multivariable logistic regression will be used to develop models that can predict bleeding and ischemic events in patients after PCI depending on antiplatelet strategy, using data from the DAPT Study, the largest PCI clinical trial conducted to date, and the Massachusetts PCI Registry, a comprehensive longitudinal registry of patients undergoing coronary intervention. Models that can predict treatment benefit or harm associated with specific strategies will be developed. In Aim 2, decision analysis methods will be employed to enhance these models such that the treatment strategy which is predicted to maximize patient benefit can be identified for all patients, and associated uncertainty in this determination can be assessed. In Aim 3, these tools will be integrated into a novel software application that can execute multivariable risk predictions at the point of care within the MGH cardiac catheterization laboratory. These tools will be used as clinical decision aids, and tested in a prospective randomized clinical trial to determine whether such interventions can enhance clinical decision making. The research will demonstrate how the end products of outcomes research can be translated into innovative interventions that can ""personalize"" medical decisions and ultimately improve patient care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stenting of the heart arteries is one of the most commonly performed procedures in the US. Patients who have these procedures are at risk for having both bleeding and clot-related complications during the procedure as well as for months to years afterwards, which require the careful use of antiplatelet medications. This research will develop and assess the impact of tools that can be used by clinicians and patients to help inform the best use of antiplatelet medications after stenting of the heart arteries, such that bleeding and clotting risks associated with these procedures can be minimized for patients.",Balancing the Risks of Ischemia and Bleeding in Percutaneous Coronary Interventio,8842697,K23HL118138,"['Accounting', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Analysis', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Heart', 'Hemorrhage', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Insurance', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'London', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Schools', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'alternative treatment', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'coronary angioplasty', 'design', 'effectiveness research', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'patient registry', 'percutaneous coronary intervention', 'point of care', 'population health', 'professor', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'routine care', 'routine practice', 'skills', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2015,137160,0.009679421352803627
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.            ",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,8935645,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'experience', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'socioeconomics', 'vulnerable adolescent', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2015,652270,0.006281287093640313
"Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Thiopurine Monitoring in IBD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During routine medical care, enormous amounts of data are collected in the form of blood counts, blood chemistries, and other biomarkers. Despite this huge investment, remarkably little effort is applied to the interpretation of this data. Outside of medicine, a revolution in the analysis of large datasets has been driven by machine learning techniques in diverse applications ranging from identifying credit card fraud to making recommendations for book purchases. Despite the prominence of bioinformatics in the NIH Roadmap Initiative, these remarkable advances have had little impact on medical care. The broad, long-term objective of this proposal is to optimize, implement, test, and nationally distribute machine learning algorithms which will utilize patterns in large datasets to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in medicine.  We propose to use the monitoring of immune suppression during thiopurine therapy for inflammatory bowel disease as a demonstration case. A low therapeutic index makes it important to optimize thiopurine dosage for inflammatory bowel disease, and assays for serum metabolites are of limited benefit. Our preliminary data show that machine learning algorithms can be used to substantially improve prognostic accuracy and reduce costs in monitoring thiopurine use. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that there are patterns in the blood counts and blood chemistries associated with effective immune suppression by thiopurine medications which can be used to guide medication dosing. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on two observations. First, our preliminary data demonstrates that machine learning can identify significant changes in immune system activation through analysis of laboratory data. Second, published data suggests that the less accurate thiopurine metabolite tests are reasonably effective in guiding dose adjustment of thiopurines.  This application proposes the optimization, implementation and testing of a improved set of thiopurine monitoring algorithms, and the nationwide delivery of the optimized algorithms through the National Cancer Institute-supported LIDDEx (Laboratory Information Digital Data Exchange) architecture. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) use longitudinal clinical data and novel mathematical methods to improve the existing algorithm for clinical response to thiopurine therapy, using objective evidence of bowel inflammation as the gold standard; (2) prospectively test whether the thiopurine monitoring algorithms can accurately classify IBD patients who are immunosuppressed and patients who are non-adherent to thiopurine medications, and whether these algorithms can prospectively guide dosing of thiopurines in patients; and (3) implement these revised algorithms on a web server using the LIDDEx grid architecture to enable nationwide clinical use, and field test this implementation in the Ann Arbor VA IBD clinic. The proposed studies will directly impact patient care throughout the United States, and by demonstrating the effectiveness of this informatics architecture, spur further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care.        This project addresses the NIH Roadmap Initiative goal of the application of innovations in bioinformatics to bedside clinical practice. The proposed studies will directly impact the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) throughout the United States. We expect that the successful demonstration of the effectiveness of the LIDDEx clinical informatics architecture will have a broad impact on clinical care beyond IBD by spurring further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care in a range of medical fields.

"Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colonoscopy is the predominant method for screening for colorectal cancer in the US. Yet, its effectiveness in screening is limited by variation in performance. For example, the rate at which physicians detect cancer precursors called adenomas during a colonoscopy has been shown to vary three-fold from one physician to another. A patient whose colonoscopy is performed by a physician with a low adenoma detection rate has a higher risk of subsequent colorectal cancer.  Our proposal centers on measuring, understanding, and improving colonoscopy quality. The major innovation of this work is to use natural language processing (NLP) to measure the quality of colonoscopy. NLP is a field of computer science in which a computer is trained to ""read"" text to identify relevant data We developed and validated the first NLP-based computer software application (C-QUAL) that analyzes colonoscopy and associated pathology reports. Our primary quality measure is adenoma detection rate because it is a common, validated measure that is linked to colorectal cancer incidence. However, we also use a number of secondary quality measures. We applied C-QUAL to almost 25,000 colonoscopy reports in one health system and found large variation in physician's performance on the quality measures. Building on this prior work, our goal is to use C-QUAL to measure colonoscopy quality across a spectrum of US practice environments, to understand what drives variation in colonoscopy quality, and to improve colonoscopy quality. In Aim 1, we propose to use the C-QUAL tool to measure performance in 4 diverse health care systems. This will be one of the largest assessments of the variation in adenoma detection rates and will span different geographic regions, payment systems, and practice settings. In Aim 2, we seek to understand why there is variation in quality. We will survey providers at the 4 health care systems about factors that might affect quality. We will link those survey results to the adenoma detection rates assessed in Aim 1 and look for key associations. It is assumed, but not proven, that providing feedback to physicians on colonoscopy quality will improve care. In Aim 3, we assess whether feedback to physicians does drive quality improvement and, building on Aim 2, explore which types of physicians may respond to feedback. Our proposal is the first to use this innovative method to measure colonoscopy quality and to use the quality scores to decrease the variation in colonoscopy performance. Together the results of the 3 aims are consistent with the NCI's focus on improving the quality of colorectal cancer screening.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prior research has shown that the quality of colonoscopy varies from physician to physician. It is important to address low quality because patients who see physicians with lower quality colonoscopies have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer in the future. To help address poor quality of colonoscopy, we propose to use a computer software program to measure colonoscopy quality, survey physicians to understand why there is variation in quality, and provide physician feedback to stimulate quality improvement.                  ",Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing,8641674,R01CA168959,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cecum', 'Cessation of life', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computer science', 'cost effective', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'payment', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2014,547410,0.005228044016163881
"Technology Application to Enhance Discharge Referral Decision Support     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decreasing readmissions through better discharge planning (DP) and transitional care is a national healthcare priority. RightCare Solutions has leveraged over 10 years of interdisciplinary academic research led by a nurse researcher, and through our highly successful phase one SBIR grant demonstrated market value for the D2S2 product and the technical expertise of our team. The D2S2 is a six-item decision support tool installed by RightCare Solutions in the hospital EHR to assist discharge planners to identify high-risk patients upon admission allowing time and focus to target appropriate transitional and post-acute care to prevent readmissions. We have achieved outstanding outcomes from our phase 1 award and are proposing further technological developments to enhance our commercial launch. The market potential for the D2S2 tool is significant since discharge decision support is estimated to be applicable to roughly 6,500 U.S. hospitals with a census that is 60% older adults equaling 14 million discharges per year. The phase 1 results indicate a significant impact on 30 and 60 day readmissions giving us strong evidence as to the value of the product. However, the results and our experience using the software indicate there is opportunity to enhance the product's accruacy and functionality. We propose to enhance our predictive accuracy through innovative data mining and machine learning techniques and to improve the functionality by electronically connecting the acute and post-acute care settings. Due to implementation in the three hospitals of the University of Pennsylvania Health System we have data on over 6,000 patients and through the continued live implementation we will accumulate data on over 25,000 patients by the start of the phase 2 grant. Using existing, and new data generated from continued operations, this proposed SBIR grant will advance the product in two major ways to enhance the commercial benefit to its users. Aim 1: Develop, test, and scale SMART capabilities, a dynamic process for improving prediction accuracy, by using hospital-specific and patient level characteristics (D2S2 variables and additional clinical and non-clinical characteristics) and modern data mining/machine learning techniques. AIM 2: Operationalize the D2S2 recommendations by electronically connecting high-risk patients with post-acute care (PAC) providers and stakeholders, known as CONNECT capabilities. Called a ""learning health system"" the end- product of this SBIR grant will provide continuous evaluation and improvement to the end-user measured against their goals. Our innovative design produces a closed-loop system that will use data from the D2S2 and hospital databases over time to ""get smarter."" Further, our enhanced product will link acute care to post-acute providers giving them advanced warning of patients who will shortly come to them for care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This decision support software identifies high-risk patients upon admission and alerts the clinicians in acute and post- acute care. This project will enhance the tool's SMART capabilities to improve its predictive accuracy and will CONNECT patients and providers with post-acute settings to coordinate the care transition.            ",Technology Application to Enhance Discharge Referral Decision Support,8710917,R44NR013609,"['Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Award', 'CCL4 gene', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Infection', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Methodology', 'Metric', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Readmission', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solutions', 'Specificity', 'Statutes and Laws', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transitional Care Planning', 'University Hospitals', 'base', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'operation', 'payment', 'phase 1 study', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment as usual']",NINR,"RIGHTCARE SOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2014,749637,0.002713088736280607
"Improving Adherence and Outcomes by Artificial Intelligence-Adapted Text Messages     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uncontrolled hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and many patients fail to take their antihypertensive medication as prescribed. We propose to use artificial intelligence (AI) to allow short message service (SMS or text messages) interventions to adapt to patients' adherence needs and substantially improve medication taking. The aims of the study are to: (1) develop AI methods for adaptive decision-making in human- centered environments and demonstrate the feasibility of the resulting AI-enhanced SMS medication adherence intervention, (2) demonstrate that the intervention can ""learn"" by adapting the SMS message stream according to patients' medication taking over time, and (3) examine potential intervention impact as measured by improvements in medication adherence and systolic blood pressures. We will recruit 100 patients with uncontrolled hypertension and antihypertensive medication non-adherence. Adherence and other covariates will be measured via surveys at baseline, 3- and 6 months; blood pressures will be measured at baseline and 6 months. Participants will be given an electronic pill-bottle adherence monitor. Participants will receive SMS messages designed to motivate antihypertensive medication adherence. Message content and frequency will adapt automatically using AI algorithms designed to automatically optimize expected pill bottle opening. For Aim 1, the first 25 patients will be enrolled to develop and test alternative RL algorithms and fine-tune the system parameters. For Aim 2, we will examine changes in the probability distribution over message-types and compare that distribution with patients' reasons for non-adherence reported at baseline. For Aim 3, we will examine changes in self-reported medication non-adherence and blood pressure and automatically-reported pill bottle openings. This pilot study will establish the feasibility and potential impact of this novel approach to mobile health messaging for self-management support. The results will be used to support an R01 application for a larger and more definitive trial of intervention impacts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Uncontrolled high blood pressure is a major cause of death and illness and many patients fail to take their blood pressure medications as prescribed. We propose to use an artificial intelligence (AI) computer system to send different types of text messages to patients.

"Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system. This NCI K07 will provide a mentored research experience, giving me the opportunity to acquire new competencies in cancer health communication for behavior change, research design and statistical methods underlying clinical trial implementation and evaluation. I will adapt collectiv intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient ""profiles"" and then use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets. Such theory-based ""market segmentation has been effective in helping patients reach lifestyle goals. However, there is a natural limit in the ability of a rule-based system to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. Current CTHC have reached this limit, and I propose to go beyond. My first aim is to develop the Web 2.0 ""S4S"" recommender system. My second aim is to evaluate S4S within the context of a NCI funded web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org). In my efforts, I will guided by my primary mentor (Dr. Houston, MD MPH) and two other mentor teams: The Cancer Health Behavior and Communication Team (Stephenie Lemon, PhD and Kathleen Mazor, EdD), and the Clinical Trial Design and Analysis Team (Jeroan Allison, MD, MS and Arlene Ash, PhD). My comprehensive training also includes coursework, seminars, and conferences.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A high priority research area identified by the NIH is to understand the role of different media in increasing consumer demand for and use of effective, individually oriented tobacco cessation treatments for diverse populations. Specifically, a research focus is on understanding how to best tailor interventions. Although effective, there is a natural limit in the ability of current rle-based tailoring systems to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time.

"Sensor Activity Monitoring, Feedback, and Outcome Measures, Stroke Rehabilitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Technologies for Healthy Independent Living"" coincides with our goal to test and further develop inexpensive wireless sensors with communication and analysis platforms to monitor everyday activities, such as walking and exercise, in disabled persons. Our Medical Daily Activity Wireless Network (MDAWN) aims to enable researchers, trialists, and clinicians to acquire reliable data about daily physical activites in the home and community, rather than only during clinic and laboratory visits or by questionnaires. Novel machine-learning algorithms developed for each person from ankle accelerometers will identify the type, quantity and quality of exercise and walking on a continuous basis. In addition, we will test an inexpensive, instrumented, ergometric pedaler designed for disabled persons, called the UCFit, to promote home-based fitness exercise. The MDAWN and UFCFit sensors send data to an Android smartphone, then over the Internet to a UCLA server for analysis. We will nest further evaluation of the utility of these remote sensing devices within the real-world setting of a clinical trial of patients with recent disabling stroke,for whom formal rehabilitation often falls short of enabling functional walking and cardiovascular fitness. In a phase 2, randomized controlled trial, we will compare two levels of weekly telephonic feedback about daily performance, made possible for the first time by remote data acquisition. The high feedback group will receive everyday performance data that includes the number of bouts and minutes of pedaling plus rate/RPMs and forces used, as well as the number of bouts of walking, duration, and average speed and distance used in home and community. The minimal feedback group only hears about total daily UCFit exercise and walking time. After 4 months of encouraging up to four 30-min sessions per week of UCFit exercise, we will test for a 50% between-group difference in amount of daily exercise and walking time. Secondary outcomes examine change in level of fitness, walking speed, and physical functioning. The two groups then cross over to high or low feedback for 4 more months, before outcomes are reassessed. Then, no feedback is given and participants are tested for amount of exercise and fitness at 12 months. We will determine which form of feedback motivates better self-management to optimize fitness and walking. We will gather unique data about mobility in the transition from rehabilitation hospital to home; quantify gait training durin usual care; assess walking skills under more complex conditions than in a laboratory; and test the responsiveness of sensor data as a ratio scale outcome measurement during a time of expected gains. This study will be the first comprehensive demonstration of mHealth remote monitoring and outcome measures of daily physical activity!          Several important public health needs will be met by testing, within a clinical trial in the home and community, a system of wearable activity and exercise monitoring technologies that measure the type, quantity and quality of walking and exercise. Our trial aims to increase fitness and enable more functional levels of daily activities in disable persons after stroke, while providing a proof-of-principle for the utility of wireless health toolsto reliably monitor real-world physical functioning and to provide clinically meaningful outcome measures.

"InfoMediator: Weaving Clinical Expertise in Online Health Communities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic illness can be overwhelming to patients because it impacts many areas of their daily lives. Accordingly, many patients turn to online health support groups to get social support. In face-to-face patient support groups (F2F), health professional moderators provide clinical expertise within the context of peer-patients' sharing of experience. However, in online health community settings, because health professionals' time and resources are expensive, it is challenging to get health professionals' opinions for thousands of messages posted each day. To solve this problem, I propose to develop methods and techniques that maximize the use of already available clinical expertise online for online peer-patient conversation threads by developing a system, InfoMediator. The InfoMediator will semi-automatically weave health professionals' existing answers to patients' questions into peer-patient conversations by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques complemented by user feedback. As the career development component of this proposal, I deepen my skills and knowledge in NLP necessary for proposed work and patient education. As I develop the NLP techniques and knowledge in patient education, I and my mentors will develop methods and techniques that address weaving clinical expertise within peer-patient conversations by designing, implementing, and evaluating socio-technical aspects of the InfoMediator. The training opportunities provided by this NIH NLM K01 grant, together with the supportive research environment at Michigan State University, will help further extend my existing expertise in human-computer interaction, design, and health informatics to establish my independent informatics research program in patient-centered technologies. Focusing on persons with diabetes, the outcomes of the proposed research will help us understand how to empower persons with diabetes to improve self- efficacy and self-care, while increasing the quality of online health information environment.             8.

"Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults with dementia are at increased risk of hospitalization when compared to adults without dementia of similar age and medical comorbidity. The increased risk of hospitalization extends to potentially preventable hospitalization (PPH) for conditions such as a urinary tract infection or asthma exacerbation, suggesting difficulty in outpatient management of patients with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of dementia such as agitation or delusions likely account for a significant amount of this risk, given their prevalence and potential to cause caregiver distress. While there are effective interventions for patients and caregivers to reduce NPS, the profile of patients that could benefit the most from intervention, therefore reducing their hospitalization risk, is unknown. Through the coordinated program of mentorship, didactics, and research that I propose, I will develop the advanced skills to derive and apply administrative, claims, and clinical encounter data to prospectively identify those patients with dementia at highest risk for hospitalization. Development of this patient-level risk phenotype means that future interventions to reduce hospitalization can then be prospectively matched to the patients most likely to benefit, a development of critical public health importance given both financial and geriatric work force constraints.  Over the next four years, my short-term training goals include: (1) address gaps in my formal research training, specifically: (a) to conduct observational analyses using large-scale claims and administrative data; (b) to derive clinical data from the electronic health record using natural language processing; and (c) to apply advanced methods of data analysis for risk prediction; (2) train in presentations, manuscript writing, and grantsmanship that culminate with a R01 proposal; (3) establish further connections with potential collaborators in the University of Michigan (UM) Pepper Center and broader community of aging researchers, national geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry communities, and the Beeson Scholar community; and (4) engage in leadership development with an emphasis on skills to lead a research team, mentor junior investigators, and communicate findings in research and clinical care settings.  These short-term goals will be paired with research aims that focus on elaborating the PPH risk profile for patients with dementia. Such research objectives can only be achieved when: (1) full clinical characteristics are available for the at-risk (i.e., non-hospitalized) population, includig (2) NPS data, which are rarely captured in standard administrative claims data. These criteria are uniquely met in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system, which has one of the nation's most advanced electronic health records (EHR). Using a national dementia case repository (N=269,565) from which I will draw matched cases (patients with dementia + PPH) and controls (non-hospitalized patients with dementia). Aim 1 will use claims and administrative data to explore patient, treatment, and facility risk factors associated with PPH. Aim 2 will use natural language processing to derive NPS from EHR clinical encounter notes and then characterize the association of NPS with PPH. Using the risk phenotype described in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 will develop logistic risk-prediction models to prospectively identify patients with dementia at highest risk for PPH. In subsequent grant proposals I will validate this risk- prediction model in other healthcare systems and prospectively pair the assessment tool with an evidence- based dementia intervention to reduce hospitalization.  My long-term career goals are to: (1) establish myself as independent investigator and national leader in geriatric mental health services research; (2) develop a programmatic line of funded health services research that develops risk-stratification models for late-life mental health and cognitive disorders; (3) translate knowledge from these research endeavors to improve the targeting and impact of future interventions research and health system delivery strategies; and (4) contribute broadly to the care of older adults by training and mentoring future clinical researchers in late-life mental health disorders. I am an Assistant Professor and geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, where I am also currently completing a MSc in Health and Healthcare Research, which provides an excellent background in health services research for clinicians. With this combination of clinical expertise and foundational training in health services research, I am uniquely qualified to undertake the advanced training activities outlined in this proposal, while UM affords the ideal environment in which to pursue this work. My primary mentor (Helen Kales, MD) and co-mentor (Frederic Blow, PhD) are national leaders in geriatric mental health who have used observational data to answer questions of national significance. My Advisory Panel includes Constantine Lyketsos, MD, MHS, an internationally-recognized expert in NPS and dementia care, and Kenneth Langa, MD, PhD, an internist, former Beeson Scholar, and renowned expert in using survey and secondary data to inform our understanding of dementia. Consultants include David Hanauer, MD, MS, an expert in bioinformatics and natural language processing, and Rodney Hayward, MD, a leader in risk assessment and intervention- targeting. My advisory team paired with resources of Michigan's Pepper Center, CTSA, and multi-disciplinary Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation make this the ideal environment in which to complete the proposed training activities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although hospitalization can negatively impact patients with dementia, we know very little about the specific risk factors associated with the chance of being hospitalized. It is important to understand what contributes to this risk, such as the behavior changes that accompany dementia, in order to identify those patients and caregivers that could benefit most from an intervention to avoid or reduce hospitalization. Given the rapidly rising numbers of patients with dementia, reducing potentially preventable hospitalization could have an enormous impact on public health.            ",Preventable Hospitalization in Dementia: The Impact of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms,8769634,K08AG048321,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institutionalization', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kale - dietary', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleeplessness', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'behavior change', 'career', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'geriatric mental health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'neuropsychiatry', 'patient population', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2014,175103,0.003991681321174048
"Automating Directly Observed Therapy as a Platform Technology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Introduction: Ai Cure Technologies LLC was established in 2009 to develop automated medication adherence monitoring solutions using computer vision technology. This SBIR Phase II will allow Ai Cure Technologies to test the accuracy and validity of its flagship product, AiView"". The SBIR Phase I demonstrated that the AiView"" platform was technically feasible and capable of confirming medication administration. Significance: Poor medication adherence is a huge burden on clinical research and clinical practice. The inability to accurately measure or improve adherence significantly compounds the problem. Clinical trials depend on people taking the drug being tested. The problem of medication adherence has been addressed - determinants of adherence are being studied and new monitoring methods developed - but no solution has been able to accurately confirm real-time medication adherence while also being affordable, flexible, and likable. The Product: Ai Cure Technologies will provide an automated DOT (Directly Observed Therapy) software platform, AiView"", for use in clinical trials which uses sophisticated computer vision technology on webcam- enabled smart phones or tablets to visually confirm medication administration. AiView"" will visually track and confirm medication administration without human supervision. Long-Term Goal: The AiView"" system will combine sophisticated computer vision technology with the best attributes of DOT for 1/400th of the cost. Automating and standardizing the way medication adherence is captured will help clinical trials better define their subjects' rates of compliance and allow them to intervene immediately in case of non-compliance. Phase II hypothesis: AiView"" can be used to accurately measure and improve medication adherence across different patient populations, and positively impact self-perception and clinical outcomes. Specific Aim #1: To demonstrate that the AiView"" system can accurately measure and improve medication adherence in a depression and a stroke patient population. Specific Aim #2: To demonstrate that the AiView"" system can improve self-perception and improve clinical outcomes in the AiView"" intervention groups Expected Outcome: The patients in the AiView"" intervention groups (depression and stroke) are expected to have statistically significant higher adherence rates than those in the pill counting groups.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor medication adherence is a huge burden on clinical research and clinical practice with the inability to accurately measure or improve adherence significantly compounding the problem. In accordance with this SBIR Phase II grant, Ai Cure Technologies will continue development and testing of its Automated DOTSM (Directly Observed Therapy) software platform, AiView"", for use in clinical trials which uses sophisticated computer vision technology on webcam-enabled smart phones or tablets to visually confirm medication administration. Automating and standardizing the way medication adherence is captured will help clinical trials better define their subjects' rates of compliance and allow tria administrators to intervene immediately in case of non-compliance, thus improving the accuracy of clinical trials the overall safety of the drug development process.            ",Automating Directly Observed Therapy as a Platform Technology,8670794,R44TR000873,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Directly Observed Therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Libraries', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phase IV Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Self Perception', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solutions', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'commercial application', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'group intervention', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'non-compliance', 'patient population', 'pill', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'usability']",NCATS,"AI CURE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2014,888295,0.008790359317697739
"Feasibility Trial of a Problem-Solving Weight Loss Mobile Application     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifestyle interventions, while effective at reducing weight and diabetes risk, are intensive (i.e., requiring 16 or more face-to-face visits) which has prevented widespread implementation. Mobile technology may reduce intervention intensity while preserving outcomes by assisting in the delivery of behavioral strategies, but very little research has explored this. Weight loss mobile applications are proliferating in the open market; however our work and others2 show that the range of evidence-based strategies addressed by these apps is narrow, primarily including self-monitoring, prompts, goal-setting, and sometimes a social network.3 A key strategy missing across apps in both the market and research is problem solving, an essential component of behavioral weight loss interventions.4 We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly, an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize tha Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone, with biggest differences observable after face-to- face visits end. Using a ""crowd-sourcing"" model, we will populate a database with problems and solutions via 1) expert-delivered problem solving sessions with a sample of obese participants trying to lose weight and 2) a pre-pilot test of the app. Using principles of ""artificial intelligence"" we will convert the algorithm of problem solving counseling into the mobile application so that it may perform this strategy on its own, but based on expert and crowd-sourced information. We will then use a series of iterative steps involving qualitative research methods (usability testing, focus groups, and pre-piloting) to refine the tool A randomized pilot feasibility trial will test the feasibility and initial effects of the Smart Coah mobile application when paired with a shortened (8- week) behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a shortened behavioral weight intervention alone. Feasibility outcomes include frequency and duration of usage of the mobile app and each feature, recruitment, and retention. We will also do exploratory analyses comparing conditions on problem solving skills and weight loss at 8- and 16-weeks. Data will support a larger efficacy trial of a Smart Coach-assisted brief behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a brief behavioral weight loss intervention alone. Our overarching goal is to develop mobile technology that reduces the intensity of lifestyle interventions as far as possible while preserving weight loss outcomes, to ultimately broaden the reach to people and settings that currently have little access.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mobile technology that effectively delivers behavioral strategies to reduce the intensity of weight loss intervention while also preserving outcomes is needed to increase the impact and reach of behavioral weight loss interventions. A key strategy missing across mobile applications developed in both the market and research is problem solving, an active ingredient and central feature of behavioral weight loss interventions. We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize that Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions as the standard program) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone.

"Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track  ABSTRACT The population of the United States, as in most developed nations, is aging and is doing so at an increasing rate. This change in demographics is having a dramatic affect on the nation's healthcare delivery system and the related public costs. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the cost of long-term care for the elderly will reach $207 billion in 2020 and $346 billion in 2040. By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will amount to almost 60% of the federal budget. The strong predilection of most of the elderly, and their families, is to prefer long-term care delivery in the home rather than in the institutionalized setting. This has resulted in a massive shift of elderly care costs to unpaid family caregivers, and this cost is not reflected in the budget numbers provided above. However, the continuation of this shifting of elderly care costs to family members is not sustainable due to the decrease in birth rate and the increasing number of adults surviving to old age without living children. As a result there will be an increasingly urgent need for publicly funded support of elderly home-based care while, at the same time, an equally urgent need to control the spirally cost of this care. More efficient delivery of home-care services for the elderly can have a significant impact on controlling, or even reducing, the cost of long-term elderly care. However, in order to deliver this care cost-effectively, a technology-based infrastructure optimized for this purpose will be required. One means of achieving this goal is by developing innovative mobile technology solutions which can monitor and maintain the activity, health and safety, and thereby the independence, of the elderly within the home. Our working hypothesis in this proposal is that a properly designed, head-mounted, wearable-computing solution can bring unique and powerful capabilities to address the need for more effective and lower-cost elderly home monitoring. We propose to develop a highly compact, light-weight, innovative technology called the Head-mounted Activity Monitoring (HAM) System. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to develop an innovative, low cost, ubiquitous and easy to use hardware and software system designed to support the independent living of the elderly. This wearable computing system accomplishes this by facilitating remote activity and safety monitoring, and also supports communication and interaction between the elderly, their caregivers, friends and family members, thereby reducing social isolation.            ",Head-mounted Activity Monitoring(HAM)System Fast Track,8647170,R44AG046969,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Behavior', 'Birth Rate', 'Breeding', 'Budgets', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ear', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eyeglasses', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Housing', 'Independent Living', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Social Security', 'Social isolation', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Wearable Computer', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'care delivery', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'demographics', 'design', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care delivery', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light weight', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'trend', 'usability']",NIA,"GEN-9, INC.",R44,2014,222981,0.023660697306983666
"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors. In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel- Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher. An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher. In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD. Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models. This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training. To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills. In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients. Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder. Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially improve the care of these patients.","Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)",8730137,K23DK090304,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Charities', 'Chemistry', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'age related', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'career', 'computer program', 'cost', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'screening', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'treatment as usual', 'trend']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K23,2014,172287,0.010889301434663351
"Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are neuromuscular disorders that account for an increasing burden of medical disability and healthcare costs. All of these disorders have some evidence to suggest that early detection and aggressive preventative care management may improve the morbidity and mortality. To that end, each disorder has an existing or nearly complete standard of care guideline. The implementation of such care requires early detection of affected individuals or those at-risk. In many disorders, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Myotonic Dystrophy, there is a documented delay in diagnosis that impairs qualified individuals from delivering such care. This is underscored by promising new treatments being developed for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, or Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It is very likely that treatment effectiveness may hinge on early delivery. This application proposes to develop a surveillance network in the states of Utah and Nevada to detect all cases of muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. These states include a diverse population of around 6 million persons. The surveillance program proposes uses an innovative tool, natural language processing, to more efficiently and reliably detect such cases from the states' electronic medical records. Secondly, this surveillance program utilizes a unique resource, The Utah Population Database, to better understand the between family variation and to confirm those cases identified from electronic health records. Finally, this proposal seeks to identify care disparities in underserved communities, particularly through guideline adherence, and address these disparities. Once complete, this proposal will achieve a better understanding of the prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in those individuals with muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. This information is critical for future disease- modifying therapeutic trials, and for the detection and care of those individuals who may not currently have access to the standard of care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Muscular Dystrophies and Spinal Muscular Atrophy are major health problems, leading to significant reduced quality of life and mortality. This proposal seeks to identify the incidence and prevalence of these disorders, and prospectively assess how application of care guidelines improves mortality and quality of life. In addition, through surveillance of the state populations of Utah and Nevada, we hope to better engage minority and other under-served populations.            ",Comp B-Western Intermountain Regional NMD STARnet,8821956,U01DD001108,[' '],NCBDDD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U01,2014,449993,0.022786867662633728
"Individualized Signal Processing Strategy to Reduce Hearing Health Care Cost/Disp  This project describes a novel approach to automate and individualize the signal processing strategy for hearing aids that can result in improved speech intelligibility in background noise, greater user satisfaction and acceptance for hearing aids, and reduce barriers to affordable hearing health care. The proposed Individualized Signal Processing Strategy (ISPS) is based upon individual performance on categorical perception tasks for speech stimuli. This differs from traditional methods based on sophisticated gain models built upon average perception, performance, and preference data. The ability to determine one's ISPS automatically, rapidly and remotely results in dramatic cost-savings and greater accessibility to hearing health care for patients who cannot afford it or for those who lack easy access to the necessary expertise. These technical achievements have the potential to radically change the hearing aid sales and delivery models yet can also be implemented within existing business models by replacing contemporary hearing aid fitting methods (e.g. adjusting to gain-frequency targets followed by subjective fine tuning) with individualized speech-based parameter adjustment. Successful implementation of the ISPS technology will impact several barriers identified in RFA-DC-12-004 including physical, infrastructure and knowledge barriers (by allowing remote or self-fitting hearing aids and minimizing the need for highly skilled expertise), economic barriers (by reducing overall costs) and cultural barriers (by providing easy access to hearing aid fitting for patients who tend to avoid seeking professional help). This Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility for the ISPS approach by (1) implementing the ISPS on a standard personal computer, (2) integrating the ISPS with a commercially available hearing aid, and (3) completing a pilot clinical study comparing outcomes with ISPS fitting to those achieved with traditional prescriptive gain fitting within the same subjects. Following successful demonstration of these objectives, a Phase II project will be proposed to enable extension of the technology to a wide range of hearing aids, patient characteristics and listening environments, including innovations supporting the use for remote and self-fitting applications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to develop, implement and test a novel approach for fitting hearing aids using an individual's speech perception abilities. This automated approach can improved listener performance while significant reducing costs of hearing health care. The automation of the fitting procedure can dramatically increase accessibility of hearing health care.                ",Individualized Signal Processing Strategy to Reduce Hearing Health Care Cost/Disp,8626066,R43DC013623,"['Achievement', 'Acoustics', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Audiology', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Cost Savings', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sales', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Speech', 'Speech Intelligibility', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'satisfaction', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'success', 'theories']",NIDCD,"SECURBORATION, INC.",R43,2014,149994,-0.03861510808149741
"NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although cervical cancer is preventable, it still continues to be a leading cause of death. Following the evidence- based guidelines for cervical cancer prevention is challenging for healthcare providers, due to which many patients do not receive the optimal preventive care. Clinical decision support (CDS) systems can potentially improve the care delivery. However, the current CDS systems only identify patients overdue for screening, and do not suggest the optimal screening interval. Moreover they do not help with surveillance of patients with abnormal screening results. This is because the existing systems lack the capability to process free- text clinical reports that contain information needed for applying the guidelines. Hence there is a critical need for natural language processing (NLP)-enabled CDS systems that can utilize discrete as well as free-text patient information for enhancing the decision support. Our long-term goal is to improve healthcare delivery of cervical cancer prevention with guideline based reminders. The central hypothesis is that NLP- enabled CDS system will significantly improve the quality of care delivery for cervical cancer prevention. The rationale is that use of NLP will improve granularity of the guideline implementation, which will in-turn enhance care delivery. As preliminary work we have developed an NLP-enabled CDS system that automatically interprets the patient information from the electronic health record and applies the national guidelines to compute the optimal recommendation for screening and surveillance. We have performed validation of the system in a non-clinical setting.1 In this application we will proceed towards deployment of the system in the clinical setting, and will carry out studies for measuring the impact on the quality of care delivery. In ai one, we will validate the system in the clinical setting and will optimize its usability and workflw integration. In aim two, we will test the hypothesis that reminders from the NLP-enabled CDS system to primary care providers will improve the quality of care delivery, by performing a one year intervention control study across four sites of a primary care practice. In aim three, we will test the hypothesis that reminders to non-adherent high-risk patients will improve their surveillance rates, by performing a randomized intervention study for three months. In this study, care coordinators will utilize the CDS system for sending reminders to patients that are non-adherent and at high risk due to abnormal screenings. The main contribution of this project will be knowledge about the effectiveness of NLP in enhancing the impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This project is innovative because the CDS system will utilize NLP to generate screening reminders for normal patients and surveillance reminders for patients with abnormal findings. This is a major advancement over existing systems that can only identify patients for screening.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield knowledge about the effectiveness of natural language processing (NLP) to enhance impact of CDS systems for cervical cancer prevention, and for clinical practice in general. This research will foster implementation of similar CDS systems across the nation for cervical cancer prevention and for other decision problems, which will improve the quality of healthcare delivery. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to AHRQ's mission to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.            ",NLP-enabled decision support for cervical cancer screening and surveillance,8678798,R21HS022911,[' '],AHRQ,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2014,145229,-0.018816356739427876
"Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are marked by significant levels of impairment and psychiatric comorbidity, affecting approximately 5-7% of the US population. Guided self-help cognitive behavioral (CBT-GSH) therapy has been show to be an effective treatment to reduce binge eating for patient with both disorders. However, there is limited uptake among both clients and therapists. One significant factor is self-monitoring, the central component of cognitive- behavioral therapy, which is both time-intensive and cumbersome in its traditional paper format for clients, as well as difficult to comprehensively address in a time-limited session for the therapist. This grant proposes to utilize emerging mobile application technology, as a tool for increasing the potency, accessibility, and efficacy of guided self-help. This will be accomplished by adapting WorkSmart Lab's current commercial mobile product for healthy eating and exercise, Noom Monitor, into a self-monitoring application integrating CBT-GSH tools for binge eaters. Additionally, the application will be used to facilitate real-time feedback to therapists about their patient progres. Therapists will be notified in real-time about any drastic changes in client eating patterns through pre-set alerts designed to assign a grade to therapists, representing each client's well-being. The feasibility and efficacy of the adapted Noom Monitor application will be examined through a randomized control trial comparing CBT-GSH + APP with CBT-GSH conducted at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine's Eating and Weight Disorders Program. The innovative utilization of technology to assist in mental health interventions has widespread implications outside of this proposal, which will be used to strategize the further development and commercialization of this product.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Guided self-help cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-GSH) has been shown to be a cost-effective and efficacious treatment for BN and BED, but has limited uptake among both clients and therapists, partly due to the time-intensive and cumbersome nature of the primary CBT-GSH intervention, self-monitoring. This grant proposes to utilize a mobile application, Noom Monitor, to reduce the burden of self-monitoring and provide real-time feedback to therapists, to enhance both therapist and client uptake of CBT-GSH. The findings from this grant has widespread implications for public health, as the use of mobile applications to strengthen treatment adherence and augment existing interventions has enormous potential for use within both mental and medical health care service delivery models.            ",Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters,8665495,R41MH096435,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Binge Eating', 'Binge eating disorder', 'Bulimia', 'Calories', 'Car Phone', 'Client', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem Solving', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Secure', 'Side', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'base', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'health record', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'mobile application', 'payment', 'phase 2 study', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'purge', 'self help', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NIMH,"NOOM, INC.",R41,2014,330324,-0.006164127747889733
"Balancing the Risks of Ischemia and Bleeding in Percutaneous Coronary Interventio     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this grant proposal is to develop and assess a system to enhance the rational and personalized application of antiplatelet therapy for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, or coronary angioplasty and stenting). This proposal describes a 5 year research and training program designed to provide the candidate, Robert Yeh, the necessary skills and experience to develop an independent academic research career in the conduct of translational cardiovascular outcomes research. Candidate: Dr. Yeh received an MSc in health policy from the London School of Economics, an MD from Harvard Medical School, and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (UCSF) and interventional cardiology (MGH). He is now a junior faculty member at the Massachusetts General Hospital with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. While he has successfully been involved with epidemiologic and secondary data analysis, Dr. Yeh will pursue additional training in the areas of decision analysis, clinical trial conduct and implementation research, and bioinformatics - training which will allow him to translate outcomes research findings into novel interventions which improve patient health. The candidate's long-term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the applied outcomes research that has a broad impact on population health. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Dr. Laura Mauri (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and chief scientific officer of the Harvard Clinical Research Institute (HCRI), and Dr. Sharon- Lise Normand (Co-Mentor), Professor of Health Care Policy at HMS and Vice Chair of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute's Methods Committee. Both are internationally recognized leaders in their respective fields, and provide complementary expertise relevant to the research and training of the candidate. Dr. Mauri has an established track record of successfully leading practice-changing multicenter clinical trials in interventional cardiology, including the NIH/FDA/Industry-sponsored Dual Antiplatelet Theray (DAPT) Study. She has mentored several cardiovascular clinical investigators, including those that have received K awards and R01 funding. Dr. Normand has successfully mentored a large number of successful academic investigators, and is an internationally recognized expert in outcomes and comparative effectiveness research methods used in this proposal. The combined resources of several Harvard Medical School institutions, including HCRI, the Department of Health Care Policy, and the MGH Heart Center will support a rich and productive environment for Dr. Yeh's career development through a combination of didactic training, seminars, weekly research meetings, and conference presentations. Research: In the current era of invasive management of coronary artery disease, balancing the tradeoff between ischemic events and bleeding complications has become integral to decisions regarding the type and duration of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary intervention. In Aim 1, multivariable logistic regression will be used to develop models that can predict bleeding and ischemic events in patients after PCI depending on antiplatelet strategy, using data from the DAPT Study, the largest PCI clinical trial conducted to date, and the Massachusetts PCI Registry, a comprehensive longitudinal registry of patients undergoing coronary intervention. Models that can predict treatment benefit or harm associated with specific strategies will be developed. In Aim 2, decision analysis methods will be employed to enhance these models such that the treatment strategy which is predicted to maximize patient benefit can be identified for all patients, and associated uncertainty in this determination can be assessed. In Aim 3, these tools will be integrated into a novel software application that can execute multivariable risk predictions at the point of care within the MGH cardiac catheterization laboratory. These tools will be used as clinical decision aids, and tested in a prospective randomized clinical trial to determine whether such interventions can enhance clinical decision making. The research will demonstrate how the end products of outcomes research can be translated into innovative interventions that can ""personalize"" medical decisions and ultimately improve patient care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stenting of the heart arteries is one of the most commonly performed procedures in the US. Patients who have these procedures are at risk for having both bleeding and clot-related complications during the procedure as well as for months to years afterwards, which require the careful use of antiplatelet medications. This research will develop and assess the impact of tools that can be used by clinicians and patients to help inform the best use of antiplatelet medications after stenting of the heart arteries, such that bleeding and clotting risks associated with these procedures can be minimized for patients.",Balancing the Risks of Ischemia and Bleeding in Percutaneous Coronary Interventio,8724553,K23HL118138,"['Accounting', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Analysis', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Heart', 'Hemorrhage', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Insurance', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'London', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Schools', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'alternative treatment', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'coronary angioplasty', 'design', 'effectiveness research', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'patient registry', 'percutaneous coronary intervention', 'point of care', 'population health', 'professor', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'routine care', 'routine practice', 'skills', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2014,137160,0.009679421352803627
"A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new investigator-initiated R01 proposal will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) to reduce teen Latina sexual behavior and pregnancy that was developed in a successful R15 feasibility trial. US teen pregnancy rates have declined but are still high among Latinas (49.4%), and the socioeconomic costs associated with these pregnancies are considerable; e.g., $3.2 billion lost tax revenue (2008 dollars) for decreased maternal educational attainment and productivity. Mighty Girls is designed to empower middle school Latinas with the skills they need to resist peer pressure that would otherwise accelerate their involvement in sexual behavior, allowing them to delay their initiation of intercourse and ultimately reduce their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.  Mighty Girls uses cutting-edge technology to create a novel, highly interactive, video game that provides a live, realistic simulation of peer pressure. Players talk directly with avatars as they would with peers in their everyday life. This intervention focuses on building communication skills for resistance that are derived from evidence-based programs that do not jeopardize friendships and incorporate Latino cultural values (Marianismo, Personalismo, Simpata) - skills valued by middle school Latinas.  In addition to efficacy testing, the proposed interdisciplinary study evaluates (1) the intervention's cost- effectiveness and (2) influence of participant characteristics and how well the intervention was delivered (implementation quality) on study outcomes. The study will be conducted with seventh grade Latinas enrolled in 20 middle schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, and followed into ninth grade, a period in which risky behaviors typically increase. Half of these schools will be randomly assigned to receive the Mighty Girls intervention and booster in addition to standard in-school sex education, while the other half will receive only standard in-school sex education. Data will be collected before and after the intervention, and at 2 (pre-booster), 12, and 24 months post-intervention using computerized surveys. Growth curve analysis will compare changes in peer resistance and sexual behavior observed in the two study conditions over the course of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses will weigh the benefit of the intervention when added to current in-school sex education against its cost of delivery. This proposal addresses Healthy People 2020 objectives to reduce pre-term birth, increase the proportion of women who use contraception to plan pregnancy, and eliminate health disparities. It lays the foundation for a dissemination study of the Mighty Girls intervention that would have a major impact on the lives of vulnerable adolescents and reduce the personal and public burden of early sexual initiation. Study results would also advance the science of communications, health games, and computer engineering by generating data on human-avatar interactions and the use of highly interactive game technology to build health-related interpersonal skills.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The teen pregnancy rate continues to be high among U.S. Latinas and results in significant personal, health care related and other societal costs. This study will test the efficacy of a promising and innovative intervention (Mighty Girls) that uses classroom activities in combination with a highly interactive video game to empower middle school Latinas to resist peer pressure to engage in intercourse. Girls play the game by talking directly with avatars that represent typical middle school children (no keyboard input required); thereby developing the skills needed to decrease their risk for teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Study results will be helpful for developing similar interventions for othe at risk youth, including boys, and guiding development of other technology based games designed to promote health.            ",A Novel Pregnancy Prevention Intervention for Latino Middle School Girls,8815713,R01NR014851,"['14 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Birth Order', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Coitus', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Contraceptive methods', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Foundations', 'Friendships', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Latina', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Names', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Peer Pressure', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Societies', 'Surveys', 'Taxes', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Video Games', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'boys', 'computerized', 'condoms', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cultural values', 'design', 'early sex initiation', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy testing', 'efficacy trial', 'empowered', 'experience', 'girls', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'intimate behavior', 'junior high school', 'multi-component intervention', 'ninth grade', 'novel', 'peer', 'positive youth development', 'post intervention', 'pregnancy prevention', 'pressure', 'programs', 'public education', 'public health relevance', 'seventh grade', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social', 'social cognitive theory', 'socioeconomics', 'young woman']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2014,709980,0.006281287093640313
"Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Thiopurine Monitoring in IBD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During routine medical care, enormous amounts of data are collected in the form of blood counts, blood chemistries, and other biomarkers. Despite this huge investment, remarkably little effort is applied to the interpretation of this data. Outside of medicine, a revolution in the analysis of large datasets has been driven by machine learning techniques in diverse applications ranging from identifying credit card fraud to making recommendations for book purchases. Despite the prominence of bioinformatics in the NIH Roadmap Initiative, these remarkable advances have had little impact on medical care. The broad, long-term objective of this proposal is to optimize, implement, test, and nationally distribute machine learning algorithms which will utilize patterns in large datasets to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in medicine.  We propose to use the monitoring of immune suppression during thiopurine therapy for inflammatory bowel disease as a demonstration case. A low therapeutic index makes it important to optimize thiopurine dosage for inflammatory bowel disease, and assays for serum metabolites are of limited benefit. Our preliminary data show that machine learning algorithms can be used to substantially improve prognostic accuracy and reduce costs in monitoring thiopurine use. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that there are patterns in the blood counts and blood chemistries associated with effective immune suppression by thiopurine medications which can be used to guide medication dosing. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on two observations. First, our preliminary data demonstrates that machine learning can identify significant changes in immune system activation through analysis of laboratory data. Second, published data suggests that the less accurate thiopurine metabolite tests are reasonably effective in guiding dose adjustment of thiopurines.  This application proposes the optimization, implementation and testing of a improved set of thiopurine monitoring algorithms, and the nationwide delivery of the optimized algorithms through the National Cancer Institute-supported LIDDEx (Laboratory Information Digital Data Exchange) architecture. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) use longitudinal clinical data and novel mathematical methods to improve the existing algorithm for clinical response to thiopurine therapy, using objective evidence of bowel inflammation as the gold standard; (2) prospectively test whether the thiopurine monitoring algorithms can accurately classify IBD patients who are immunosuppressed and patients who are non-adherent to thiopurine medications, and whether these algorithms can prospectively guide dosing of thiopurines in patients; and (3) implement these revised algorithms on a web server using the LIDDEx grid architecture to enable nationwide clinical use, and field test this implementation in the Ann Arbor VA IBD clinic. The proposed studies will directly impact patient care throughout the United States, and by demonstrating the effectiveness of this informatics architecture, spur further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care.        This project addresses the NIH Roadmap Initiative goal of the application of innovations in bioinformatics to bedside clinical practice. The proposed studies will directly impact the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) throughout the United States. We expect that the successful demonstration of the effectiveness of the LIDDEx clinical informatics architecture will have a broad impact on clinical care beyond IBD by spurring further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care in a range of medical fields.

"First Person Vision for Objective Evaluation of Caregiving Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 40 million family members provide informal care to older individuals annually, making them an essential component of the health care system in the US. Almost 11 million Americans provide unpaid care for a person with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. Health care professionals typically rely heavily on self-report by family members to understand the dynamics of the caregiving dyad, the quality of caregiving, and the impact of dementia on everyday life. Though invaluable, this information may be devoid of context, or biased due to caregiver reticence or imperfect recall. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to understand the challenges of caregiver/care-recipient interactions, and caregivers' responsiveness to clinicians' suggestions for handling difficult caregiving challenges. Equipped with tiny sensors and worn on eyeglasses or clothing, FPV devices capture video and sound within the user's field of view. These devices can document actual interaction, permit identification of antecedent circumstances or consequences, and provide the basis for targeted intervention designed to assure safe interactions and to prevent, eliminate, or ameliorate distressing care-recipient behaviors. This project with caregiving dyads aims: to describe the feasibility, usability, and interpretability of FPV device use at home (Aim 1); to explore the effect of nurse- delivered intervention, informed by FPV data, on reducing problem behaviors and caregiver burden when delivered in person within 2 weeks (Aim 2) or delivered by phone in ""near real-time,"" that is, within 1 hour, of problem behavior events (Aim 3); and to develop algorithms for an automated system capable of generating real-time Machine Learning responses that promote effective handling of problem behaviors (Aim 4). This project will involve 40 caregiving dyads comprising family caregivers age 21 or older who experience these problem behaviors and care-recipients age 50 or older with moderate to severe dementia (MMSE score <18) due to Alzheimer's disease, frontal temporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, or vascular dementia. Baseline data will include demographic, health, and caregiving information including problem behaviors, functional status, and attitudes toward technology. Caregivers among the first 20 dyads will wear two FPV devices during waking hours over 7 days and signal when the care-recipient takes medications and engages in problematic behavior. Within 2 weeks the caregiver will be shown video clips of his or her FPV data as part of a nurse- delivered intervention focused on handling problem behaviors, then wear the FPV devices for another 7 days and receive brief telephone contact to reinforce the intervention, which we anticipate will reduce problem behaviors and caregiver burden. This pilot intervention study will be replicated with the second 20 dyads, though the nurse will access FPV data remotely and intervene by phone within 1 hour of problem events. FPV data gathered in these investigations will be used to develop algorithms for an innovative, automated tool for objective assessment and timely, tailored intervention aimed at improving caregiving quality and safety.        Family caregivers often find it difficult to deal with the agitation, resistance, and repetitive behaviors of their family members with moderate or severe dementia, and they frequently ask health care professionals how to handle these difficult interactions. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to providing health care professionals with objective evidence of caregiving quality and responsiveness to recommended strategies for dealing with everyday problem behaviors. This project explores the use of FPV technology to assess specific interactions between caregivers and care-recipients, and it examines how FPV data can inform nurse-delivered intervention and provides the basis for development of an automated, intelligent assessment and intervention tool to reduce problem behaviors and decrease caregiver burden.

"Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers for Smoker), a next- generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC) system. Unlike current rule- based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally- relevant tailoring for new smokers entering the system. This NCI K07 will provide a mentored research experience, giving me the opportunity to acquire new competencies in cancer health communication for behavior change, research design and statistical methods underlying clinical trial implementation and evaluation. I will adapt collectiv intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient ""profiles"" and then use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets. Such theory-based ""market segmentation has been effective in helping patients reach lifestyle goals. However, there is a natural limit in the ability of a rule-based system to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. Current CTHC have reached this limit, and I propose to go beyond. My first aim is to develop the Web 2.0 ""S4S"" recommender system. My second aim is to evaluate S4S within the context of a NCI funded web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org). In my efforts, I will guided by my primary mentor (Dr. Houston, MD MPH) and two other mentor teams: The Cancer Health Behavior and Communication Team (Stephenie Lemon, PhD and Kathleen Mazor, EdD), and the Clinical Trial Design and Analysis Team (Jeroan Allison, MD, MS and Arlene Ash, PhD). My comprehensive training also includes coursework, seminars, and conferences.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A high priority research area identified by the NIH is to understand the role of different media in increasing consumer demand for and use of effective, individually oriented tobacco cessation treatments for diverse populations. Specifically, a research focus is on understanding how to best tailor interventions. Although effective, there is a natural limit in the ability of current rle-based tailoring systems to truly personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. This NCI K07 will advance computer tailoring by adapting machine learning collective intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance the personal relevance of the health communication.            ",Developing Smokers for Smoker (S4S): A Collective Intelligence tailoring system,8581564,K07CA172677,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Randomized', 'Receiver Operator Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'behavior change', 'communication behavior', 'consumer demand', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'research study', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'symposium', 'theories', 'web services', 'web site']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K07,2013,140793,0.0031143894719690753
"Measuring and Improving Colonoscopy Quality Using Natural Language Processing No abstract available  Prior research has shown that the quality of colonoscopy varies from physician to physician. It is important to address low quality because patients who see physicians with lower quality colonoscopies have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer in the future. To help address poor quality of colonoscopy, we propose to use a computer software program to measure colonoscopy quality, survey physicians to understand why there is variation in quality, and test methods of physician feedback to stimulate quality improvement.

"Sensor Activity Monitoring, Feedback, and Outcome Measures, Stroke Rehabilitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Technologies for Healthy Independent Living"" coincides with our goal to test and further develop inexpensive wireless sensors with communication and analysis platforms to monitor everyday activities, such as walking and exercise, in disabled persons. Our Medical Daily Activity Wireless Network (MDAWN) aims to enable researchers, trialists, and clinicians to acquire reliable data about daily physical activites in the home and community, rather than only during clinic and laboratory visits or by questionnaires. Novel machine-learning algorithms developed for each person from ankle accelerometers will identify the type, quantity and quality of exercise and walking on a continuous basis. In addition, we will test an inexpensive, instrumented, ergometric pedaler designed for disabled persons, called the UCFit, to promote home-based fitness exercise. The MDAWN and UFCFit sensors send data to an Android smartphone, then over the Internet to a UCLA server for analysis. We will nest further evaluation of the utility of these remote sensing devices within the real-world setting of a clinical trial of patients with recent disabling stroke,for whom formal rehabilitation often falls short of enabling functional walking and cardiovascular fitness. In a phase 2, randomized controlled trial, we will compare two levels of weekly telephonic feedback about daily performance, made possible for the first time by remote data acquisition. The high feedback group will receive everyday performance data that includes the number of bouts and minutes of pedaling plus rate/RPMs and forces used, as well as the number of bouts of walking, duration, and average speed and distance used in home and community. The minimal feedback group only hears about total daily UCFit exercise and walking time. After 4 months of encouraging up to four 30-min sessions per week of UCFit exercise, we will test for a 50% between-group difference in amount of daily exercise and walking time. Secondary outcomes examine change in level of fitness, walking speed, and physical functioning. The two groups then cross over to high or low feedback for 4 more months, before outcomes are reassessed. Then, no feedback is given and participants are tested for amount of exercise and fitness at 12 months. We will determine which form of feedback motivates better self-management to optimize fitness and walking. We will gather unique data about mobility in the transition from rehabilitation hospital to home; quantify gait training durin usual care; assess walking skills under more complex conditions than in a laboratory; and test the responsiveness of sensor data as a ratio scale outcome measurement during a time of expected gains. This study will be the first comprehensive demonstration of mHealth remote monitoring and outcome measures of daily physical activity!          Several important public health needs will be met by testing, within a clinical trial in the home and community, a system of wearable activity and exercise monitoring technologies that measure the type, quantity and quality of walking and exercise. Our trial aims to increase fitness and enable more functional levels of daily activities in disable persons after stroke, while providing a proof-of-principle for the utility of wireless health toolsto reliably monitor real-world physical functioning and to provide clinically meaningful outcome measures. These generic tools for daily care and research can be deployed across diseases and disabilities.

"Automating Directly Observed Therapy as a Platform Technology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Introduction: Ai Cure Technologies LLC was established in 2009 to develop automated medication adherence monitoring solutions using computer vision technology. This SBIR Phase II will allow Ai Cure Technologies to test the accuracy and validity of its flagship product, AiView"". The SBIR Phase I demonstrated that the AiView"" platform was technically feasible and capable of confirming medication administration. Significance: Poor medication adherence is a huge burden on clinical research and clinical practice. The inability to accurately measure or improve adherence significantly compounds the problem. Clinical trials depend on people taking the drug being tested. The problem of medication adherence has been addressed - determinants of adherence are being studied and new monitoring methods developed - but no solution has been able to accurately confirm real-time medication adherence while also being affordable, flexible, and likable. The Product: Ai Cure Technologies will provide an automated DOT (Directly Observed Therapy) software platform, AiView"", for use in clinical trials which uses sophisticated computer vision technology on webcam- enabled smart phones or tablets to visually confirm medication administration. AiView"" will visually track and confirm medication administration without human supervision. Long-Term Goal: The AiView"" system will combine sophisticated computer vision technology with the best attributes of DOT for 1/400th of the cost. Automating and standardizing the way medication adherence is captured will help clinical trials better define their subjects' rates of compliance and allow them to intervene immediately in case of non-compliance. Phase II hypothesis: AiView"" can be used to accurately measure and improve medication adherence across different patient populations, and positively impact self-perception and clinical outcomes. Specific Aim #1: To demonstrate that the AiView"" system can accurately measure and improve medication adherence in a depression and a stroke patient population. Specific Aim #2: To demonstrate that the AiView"" system can improve self-perception and improve clinical outcomes in the AiView"" intervention groups Expected Outcome: The patients in the AiView"" intervention groups (depression and stroke) are expected to have statistically significant higher adherence rates than those in the pill counting groups.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Poor medication adherence is a huge burden on clinical research and clinical practice with the inability to accurately measure or improve adherence significantly compounding the problem. In accordance with this SBIR Phase II grant, Ai Cure Technologies will continue development and testing of its Automated DOTSM (Directly Observed Therapy) software platform, AiView"", for use in clinical trials which uses sophisticated computer vision technology on webcam-enabled smart phones or tablets to visually confirm medication administration. Automating and standardizing the way medication adherence is captured will help clinical trials better define their subjects' rates of compliance and allow tria administrators to intervene immediately in case of non-compliance, thus improving the accuracy of clinical trials the overall safety of the drug development process.            ",Automating Directly Observed Therapy as a Platform Technology,8524716,R44TR000873,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Directly Observed Therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Libraries', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phase IV Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Self Perception', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solutions', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'commercial application', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'group intervention', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'meetings', 'non-compliance', 'patient population', 'pill', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'usability']",NCATS,"AI CURE TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R44,2013,895818,0.008790359317697739
"Feasibility Trial of a Problem-Solving Weight Loss Mobile Application     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifestyle interventions, while effective at reducing weight and diabetes risk, are intensive (i.e., requiring 16 or more face-to-face visits) which has prevented widespread implementation. Mobile technology may reduce intervention intensity while preserving outcomes by assisting in the delivery of behavioral strategies, but very little research has explored this. Weight loss mobile applications are proliferating in the open market; however our work and others2 show that the range of evidence-based strategies addressed by these apps is narrow, primarily including self-monitoring, prompts, goal-setting, and sometimes a social network.3 A key strategy missing across apps in both the market and research is problem solving, an essential component of behavioral weight loss interventions.4 We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly, an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize tha Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone, with biggest differences observable after face-to- face visits end. Using a ""crowd-sourcing"" model, we will populate a database with problems and solutions via 1) expert-delivered problem solving sessions with a sample of obese participants trying to lose weight and 2) a pre-pilot test of the app. Using principles of ""artificial intelligence"" we will convert the algorithm of problem solving counseling into the mobile application so that it may perform this strategy on its own, but based on expert and crowd-sourced information. We will then use a series of iterative steps involving qualitative research methods (usability testing, focus groups, and pre-piloting) to refine the tool A randomized pilot feasibility trial will test the feasibility and initial effects of the Smart Coah mobile application when paired with a shortened (8- week) behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a shortened behavioral weight intervention alone. Feasibility outcomes include frequency and duration of usage of the mobile app and each feature, recruitment, and retention. We will also do exploratory analyses comparing conditions on problem solving skills and weight loss at 8- and 16-weeks. Data will support a larger efficacy trial of a Smart Coach-assisted brief behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a brief behavioral weight loss intervention alone. Our overarching goal is to develop mobile technology that reduces the intensity of lifestyle interventions as far as possible while preserving weight loss outcomes, to ultimately broaden the reach to people and settings that currently have little access.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mobile technology that effectively delivers behavioral strategies to reduce the intensity of weight loss intervention while also preserving outcomes is needed to increase the impact and reach of behavioral weight loss interventions. A key strategy missing across mobile applications developed in both the market and research is problem solving, an active ingredient and central feature of behavioral weight loss interventions. We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize that Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions as the standard program) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone.            ",Feasibility Trial of a Problem-Solving Weight Loss Mobile Application,8492838,R21DK098556,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Market Research', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Proliferating', 'Psychologist', 'Qualitative Research', 'Randomized', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Social Network', 'Solutions', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'diabetes risk', 'diet and exercise', 'efficacy trial', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'information processing', 'lifestyle intervention', 'medical schools', 'post intervention', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'usability', 'web interface', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R21,2013,263542,0.0013245690778097752
"Translational refinement of adaptive communication system for locked-in patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proliferation of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology promises locked-in patients potential ways to communicate successfully. Most BCI systems either involve selection from among a set of simultaneously presented stimuli, requiring extensive control of the interface; or use binary stimulus selection mechanisms that fail to achieve high communication rates because of slow intent detection or a fixed (context independent) ordering of stimuli. We propose a new interface using binary selection of text input via rapid serial visual presentation of natural language components. Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from acquired neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) and neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) drive the proposed research. Four laboratories form an alliance for this translational research project: basic research (Erdogmus, engineering; Roark, computer science and natural language processing), and clinical research (Oken, neurology/neurophysiology; Fried-Oken, augmentative communication/neurogenic communication disorders). Our aims are (1) to develop an innovative EEG-based BCI that achieves increased communication rates with fewer errors and greater satisfaction for the target SSPI populations; (2) to iteratively refine the system in the laboratory with user feedback from healthy subjects and expert LIS users of marketed AAC systems; (3) to evaluate the performance of the system within the natural clinical settings of SSPI patients. The innovative BCI is the RSVP Keyboard with three essential features: (1) rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of linguistic components ranging from letters to words to phrases; (2) a detection mechanism that employs multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and/or other suitable response mechanisms that can reliably indicate the binary intent of the user and adapt based on individualized neurophysiologic data of the user; and (3) an open-vocabulary natural language model with a capability for accurate predictions of upcoming text. Theoretical framework is based on a solid Bayesian foundation; clinical usability is based on the WHO ICF (WHO, 2001) and an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) model of participation. Rigorous experimental scrutiny in both clinical laboratory and natural settings will be obtained with able-bodied subjects and SSPI patients. Measures of learning rate, speed of message production, error rate and user satisfaction for different iterations of the RSVP keyboard will be obtained using an hypothesis-driven crossover design for 36 healthy subjects, and alternating treatment randomization design for 40 patients with SSPI. Descriptions of the motor, cognitive, and language skills of LIS patients using the novel system in their natural environments will inform clinical guidelines and functional device adaptations to better individualize treatment for children and adults with SSPI. The collaborative nature of the proposed translational research is expected to yield new knowledge for both BCI development and clinical AAC use.    Relevance: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily care giving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The RSVP keyboard and proposed language models are innovative technological discoveries that are being applied to clinical augmentative communication tools so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care. The proposed project stresses the translation of basic computer science into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.

"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors. In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel- Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher. An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher. In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD. Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models. This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training. To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills. In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients. Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder. Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially improve the care of these patients.","Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)",8521270,K23DK090304,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Charities', 'Chemistry', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'age related', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'career', 'computer program', 'cost', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'screening', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'treatment as usual', 'trend']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K23,2013,172287,0.010889301434663351
"Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are marked by significant levels of impairment and psychiatric comorbidity, affecting approximately 5-7% of the US population. Guided self-help cognitive behavioral (CBT-GSH) therapy has been show to be an effective treatment to reduce binge eating for patient with both disorders. However, there is limited uptake among both clients and therapists. One significant factor is self-monitoring, the central component of cognitive- behavioral therapy, which is both time-intensive and cumbersome in its traditional paper format for clients, as well as difficult to comprehensively address in a time-limited session for the therapist. This grant proposes to utilize emerging mobile application technology, as a tool for increasing the potency, accessibility, and efficacy of guided self-help. This will be accomplished by adapting WorkSmart Lab's current commercial mobile product for healthy eating and exercise, Noom Monitor, into a self-monitoring application integrating CBT-GSH tools for binge eaters. Additionally, the application will be used to facilitate real-time feedback to therapists about their patient progres. Therapists will be notified in real-time about any drastic changes in client eating patterns through pre-set alerts designed to assign a grade to therapists, representing each client's well-being. The feasibility and efficacy of the adapted Noom Monitor application will be examined through a randomized control trial comparing CBT-GSH + APP with CBT-GSH conducted at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine's Eating and Weight Disorders Program. The innovative utilization of technology to assist in mental health interventions has widespread implications outside of this proposal, which will be used to strategize the further development and commercialization of this product.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Guided self-help cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-GSH) has been shown to be a cost-effective and efficacious treatment for BN and BED, but has limited uptake among both clients and therapists, partly due to the time-intensive and cumbersome nature of the primary CBT-GSH intervention, self-monitoring. This grant proposes to utilize a mobile application, Noom Monitor, to reduce the burden of self-monitoring and provide real-time feedback to therapists, to enhance both therapist and client uptake of CBT-GSH. The findings from this grant has widespread implications for public health, as the use of mobile applications to strengthen treatment adherence and augment existing interventions has enormous potential for use within both mental and medical health care service delivery models.            ",Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters,8521678,R41MH096435,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Binge Eating', 'Binge eating disorder', 'Bulimia', 'Calories', 'Car Phone', 'Client', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem Solving', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Secure', 'Side', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'base', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'health record', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'payment', 'phase 2 study', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'purge', 'self help', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NIMH,"NOOM, INC.",R41,2013,343684,-0.006164127747889733
"Balancing the Risks of Ischemia and Bleeding in Percutaneous Coronary Interventio     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this grant proposal is to develop and assess a system to enhance the rational and personalized application of antiplatelet therapy for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, or coronary angioplasty and stenting). This proposal describes a 5 year research and training program designed to provide the candidate, Robert Yeh, the necessary skills and experience to develop an independent academic research career in the conduct of translational cardiovascular outcomes research. Candidate: Dr. Yeh received an MSc in health policy from the London School of Economics, an MD from Harvard Medical School, and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (UCSF) and interventional cardiology (MGH). He is now a junior faculty member at the Massachusetts General Hospital with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. While he has successfully been involved with epidemiologic and secondary data analysis, Dr. Yeh will pursue additional training in the areas of decision analysis, clinical trial conduct and implementation research, and bioinformatics - training which will allow him to translate outcomes research findings into novel interventions which improve patient health. The candidate's long-term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the applied outcomes research that has a broad impact on population health. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Dr. Laura Mauri (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and chief scientific officer of the Harvard Clinical Research Institute (HCRI), and Dr. Sharon- Lise Normand (Co-Mentor), Professor of Health Care Policy at HMS and Vice Chair of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute's Methods Committee. Both are internationally recognized leaders in their respective fields, and provide complementary expertise relevant to the research and training of the candidate. Dr. Mauri has an established track record of successfully leading practice-changing multicenter clinical trials in interventional cardiology, including the NIH/FDA/Industry-sponsored Dual Antiplatelet Theray (DAPT) Study. She has mentored several cardiovascular clinical investigators, including those that have received K awards and R01 funding. Dr. Normand has successfully mentored a large number of successful academic investigators, and is an internationally recognized expert in outcomes and comparative effectiveness research methods used in this proposal. The combined resources of several Harvard Medical School institutions, including HCRI, the Department of Health Care Policy, and the MGH Heart Center will support a rich and productive environment for Dr. Yeh's career development through a combination of didactic training, seminars, weekly research meetings, and conference presentations. Research: In the current era of invasive management of coronary artery disease, balancing the tradeoff between ischemic events and bleeding complications has become integral to decisions regarding the type and duration of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary intervention. In Aim 1, multivariable logistic regression will be used to develop models that can predict bleeding and ischemic events in patients after PCI depending on antiplatelet strategy, using data from the DAPT Study, the largest PCI clinical trial conducted to date, and the Massachusetts PCI Registry, a comprehensive longitudinal registry of patients undergoing coronary intervention. Models that can predict treatment benefit or harm associated with specific strategies will be developed. In Aim 2, decision analysis methods will be employed to enhance these models such that the treatment strategy which is predicted to maximize patient benefit can be identified for all patients, and associated uncertainty in this determination can be assessed. In Aim 3, these tools will be integrated into a novel software application that can execute multivariable risk predictions at the point of care within the MGH cardiac catheterization laboratory. These tools will be used as clinical decision aids, and tested in a prospective randomized clinical trial to determine whether such interventions can enhance clinical decision making. The research will demonstrate how the end products of outcomes research can be translated into innovative interventions that can ""personalize"" medical decisions and ultimately improve patient care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stenting of the heart arteries is one of the most commonly performed procedures in the US. Patients who have these procedures are at risk for having both bleeding and clot-related complications during the procedure as well as for months to years afterwards, which require the careful use of antiplatelet medications. This research will develop and assess the impact of tools that can be used by clinicians and patients to help inform the best use of antiplatelet medications after stenting of the heart arteries, such that bleeding and clotting risks associated with these procedures can be minimized for patients.            ",Balancing the Risks of Ischemia and Bleeding in Percutaneous Coronary Interventio,8487063,K23HL118138,"['Accounting', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Analysis', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Heart', 'Hemorrhage', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Insurance', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'London', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Schools', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'alternative treatment', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'coronary angioplasty', 'design', 'effectiveness research', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'patient registry', 'percutaneous coronary intervention', 'point of care', 'population health', 'professor', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'routine care', 'routine practice', 'skills', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2013,137160,0.009679421352803627
"Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Thiopurine Monitoring in IBD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During routine medical care, enormous amounts of data are collected in the form of blood counts, blood chemistries, and other biomarkers. Despite this huge investment, remarkably little effort is applied to the interpretation of this data. Outside of medicine, a revolution in the analysis of large datasets has been driven by machine learning techniques in diverse applications ranging from identifying credit card fraud to making recommendations for book purchases. Despite the prominence of bioinformatics in the NIH Roadmap Initiative, these remarkable advances have had little impact on medical care. The broad, long-term objective of this proposal is to optimize, implement, test, and nationally distribute machine learning algorithms which will utilize patterns in large datasets to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in medicine.  We propose to use the monitoring of immune suppression during thiopurine therapy for inflammatory bowel disease as a demonstration case. A low therapeutic index makes it important to optimize thiopurine dosage for inflammatory bowel disease, and assays for serum metabolites are of limited benefit. Our preliminary data show that machine learning algorithms can be used to substantially improve prognostic accuracy and reduce costs in monitoring thiopurine use. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that there are patterns in the blood counts and blood chemistries associated with effective immune suppression by thiopurine medications which can be used to guide medication dosing. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on two observations. First, our preliminary data demonstrates that machine learning can identify significant changes in immune system activation through analysis of laboratory data. Second, published data suggests that the less accurate thiopurine metabolite tests are reasonably effective in guiding dose adjustment of thiopurines.  This application proposes the optimization, implementation and testing of a improved set of thiopurine monitoring algorithms, and the nationwide delivery of the optimized algorithms through the National Cancer Institute-supported LIDDEx (Laboratory Information Digital Data Exchange) architecture. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) use longitudinal clinical data and novel mathematical methods to improve the existing algorithm for clinical response to thiopurine therapy, using objective evidence of bowel inflammation as the gold standard; (2) prospectively test whether the thiopurine monitoring algorithms can accurately classify IBD patients who are immunosuppressed and patients who are non-adherent to thiopurine medications, and whether these algorithms can prospectively guide dosing of thiopurines in patients; and (3) implement these revised algorithms on a web server using the LIDDEx grid architecture to enable nationwide clinical use, and field test this implementation in the Ann Arbor VA IBD clinic. The proposed studies will directly impact patient care throughout the United States, and by demonstrating the effectiveness of this informatics architecture, spur further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses the NIH Roadmap Initiative goal of the application of innovations in bioinformatics to bedside clinical practice. The proposed studies will directly impact the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) throughout the United States. We expect that the successful demonstration of the effectiveness of the LIDDEx clinical informatics architecture will have a broad impact on clinical care beyond IBD by spurring further innovation and application of bioinformatics to clinical care in a range of medical fields.           This project addresses the NIH Roadmap Initiative goal of the application of innovations in bioinformatics to bedside clinical practice.

"First Person Vision for Objective Evaluation of Caregiving Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 40 million family members provide informal care to older individuals annually, making them an essential component of the health care system in the US. Almost 11 million Americans provide unpaid care for a person with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. Health care professionals typically rely heavily on self-report by family members to understand the dynamics of the caregiving dyad, the quality of caregiving, and the impact of dementia on everyday life. Though invaluable, this information may be devoid of context, or biased due to caregiver reticence or imperfect recall. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to understand the challenges of caregiver/care-recipient interactions, and caregivers' responsiveness to clinicians' suggestions for handling difficult caregiving challenges. Equipped with tiny sensors and worn on eyeglasses or clothing, FPV devices capture video and sound within the user's field of view. These devices can document actual interaction, permit identification of antecedent circumstances or consequences, and provide the basis for targeted intervention designed to assure safe interactions and to prevent, eliminate, or ameliorate distressing care-recipient behaviors. This project with caregiving dyads aims: to describe the feasibility, usability, and interpretability of FPV device use at home (Aim 1); to explore the effect of nurse- delivered intervention, informed by FPV data, on reducing problem behaviors and caregiver burden when delivered in person within 2 weeks (Aim 2) or delivered by phone in ""near real-time,"" that is, within 1 hour, of problem behavior events (Aim 3); and to develop algorithms for an automated system capable of generating real-time Machine Learning responses that promote effective handling of problem behaviors (Aim 4). This project will involve 40 caregiving dyads comprising family caregivers age 21 or older who experience these problem behaviors and care-recipients age 50 or older with moderate to severe dementia (MMSE score <18) due to Alzheimer's disease, frontal temporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, or vascular dementia. Baseline data will include demographic, health, and caregiving information including problem behaviors, functional status, and attitudes toward technology. Caregivers among the first 20 dyads will wear two FPV devices during waking hours over 7 days and signal when the care-recipient takes medications and engages in problematic behavior. Within 2 weeks the caregiver will be shown video clips of his or her FPV data as part of a nurse- delivered intervention focused on handling problem behaviors, then wear the FPV devices for another 7 days and receive brief telephone contact to reinforce the intervention, which we anticipate will reduce problem behaviors and caregiver burden. This pilot intervention study will be replicated with the second 20 dyads, though the nurse will access FPV data remotely and intervene by phone within 1 hour of problem events. FPV data gathered in these investigations will be used to develop algorithms for an innovative, automated tool for objective assessment and timely, tailored intervention aimed at improving caregiving quality and safety.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Family caregivers often find it difficult to deal with the agitation, resistance, and repetitive behaviors of their family members with moderate or severe dementia, and they frequently ask health care professionals how to handle these difficult interactions. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to providing health care professionals with objective evidence of caregiving quality and responsiveness to recommended strategies for dealing with everyday problem behaviors. This project explores the use of FPV technology to assess specific interactions between caregivers and care-recipients, and it examines how FPV data can inform nurse-delivered intervention and provides the basis for development of an automated, intelligent assessment and intervention tool to reduce problem behaviors and decrease caregiver burden.           Family caregivers often find it difficult to deal with the agitation, resistance, and repetitive behaviors of their family members with moderate or severe dementia, and they frequently ask health care professionals how to handle these difficult interactions.

"Sensor Activity Monitoring, Feedback, and Outcome Measures, Stroke Rehabilitation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Technologies for Healthy Independent Living"" coincides with our goal to test and further develop inexpensive wireless sensors with communication and analysis platforms to monitor everyday activities, such as walking and exercise, in disabled persons. Our Medical Daily Activity Wireless Network (MDAWN) aims to enable researchers, trialists, and clinicians to acquire reliable data about daily physical activites in the home and community, rather than only during clinic and laboratory visits or by questionnaires. Novel machine-learning algorithms developed for each person from ankle accelerometers will identify the type, quantity and quality of exercise and walking on a continuous basis. In addition, we will test an inexpensive, instrumented, ergometric pedaler designed for disabled persons, called the UCFit, to promote home-based fitness exercise. The MDAWN and UFCFit sensors send data to an Android smartphone, then over the Internet to a UCLA server for analysis. We will nest further evaluation of the utility of these remote sensing devices within the real-world setting of a clinical trial of patients with recent disabling stroke,for whom formal rehabilitation often falls short of enabling functional walking and cardiovascular fitness. In a phase 2, randomized controlled trial, we will compare two levels of weekly telephonic feedback about daily performance, made possible for the first time by remote data acquisition. The high feedback group will receive everyday performance data that includes the number of bouts and minutes of pedaling plus rate/RPMs and forces used, as well as the number of bouts of walking, duration, and average speed and distance used in home and community. The minimal feedback group only hears about total daily UCFit exercise and walking time. After 4 months of encouraging up to four 30-min sessions per week of UCFit exercise, we will test for a 50% between-group difference in amount of daily exercise and walking time. Secondary outcomes examine change in level of fitness, walking speed, and physical functioning. The two groups then cross over to high or low feedback for 4 more months, before outcomes are reassessed. Then, no feedback is given and participants are tested for amount of exercise and fitness at 12 months. We will determine which form of feedback motivates better self-management to optimize fitness and walking. We will gather unique data about mobility in the transition from rehabilitation hospital to home; quantify gait training durin usual care; assess walking skills under more complex conditions than in a laboratory; and test the responsiveness of sensor data as a ratio scale outcome measurement during a time of expected gains. This study will be the first comprehensive demonstration of mHealth remote monitoring and outcome measures of daily physical activity!        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Several important public health needs will be met by testing, within a clinical trial in the home and community, a system of wearable activity and exercise monitoring technologies that measure the type, quantity and quality of walking and exercise. Our trial aims to increase fitness and enable more functional levels of daily activities in disable persons after stroke, while providing a proof-of-principle for the utility of wireless health toolsto reliably monitor real-world physical functioning and to provide clinically meaningful outcome measures.

"Passive Activity Monitoring with Patient Identification and Gesture Detection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease and dementia present a massive care challenge for family members and care professionals. In the last year of a patient's life, half of family caregivers report spending 46 or more hours a week assisting him/her with activities of daily living (ADL). Ingenium Care proposes to create a passive, self-learning, system for activity monitoring and support of elderly persons using the novel technology of Microsoft's Kinect device. This advanced activity monitoring combined with Ingenium Care's interactive communications and support system will extend independent living and the successful conduct of everyday tasks for the elderly with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, people with disabilities, and soldiers with PTSD and TBI. Existing monitoring technology has limited activity recognition capability or uses many sensors and wearable devices. The need for wearable devices requires cooperation from the elderly that may not reminder or resent to wear it. We propose to replace our existing wearable badge technology with a passive device based on the Kinect device from Microsoft. A network of these sensors provides precise location information within a home or facility and detects falls and gestures such as eating, drinking or taking medications. This device will eliminate the need to wear any device. Aim #1 - Goal: Develop Algorithms for Proof of Concept Gesture Recognition. Aim #2 - Goal: Do laboratory training and testing of detection algorithms utilizing a single work station. Aim #3 - Goal: Perform randomized activities and gestures in a simulated living environment and iteratively improve algorithms.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Today, 60 million Americans - one in five - require assistance in their living arrangements and daily activities.

"Predicting Care Coordination Needs of Frail Older Adults from Longitudinal Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current health care system fails to meet the needs of most chronically ill older adults. Given that the chronically ill are the major consumers of health care dollars, development of systems that provide support in the management of the complex health care needs is critical. Care coordination is one intervention that is recognized as a mechanism to support chronically ill persons in managing their health care. However, care coordination has multiple definitions, models, providers, and settings. Most care coordination programs have been focused on specific time periods such as transition between care settings. Further, there is limited evidence about the key components of care coordination, making the content of care coordination virtually a ""black box"" although payment for care coordination is included in current health care legislation. Accordingly, the purpose of this proposed study is to examine the type and amount of nurse care coordination interventions and the relationship of these interventions to both patient characteristics and outcomes. To be specific, this study aims to  "" identify interventions used in nurse care coordination for frail older community dwelling adults;  "" identify the relationships among patient characteristics, components of nurse care coordination  intervention, and patient outcomes; and  "" develop and validate models predicting patient outcomes for frail older community dwelling adults who  received nurse care coordination interventions. This proposed study employs a secondary analysis that will examine existing datasets derived from a recent randomized controlled trial that tested the effectiveness of a home care medication management program (HCMM) for frail older adults. The datasets examined will include electronic patient records and communication logs documented through the CareFacts(R) system, HCMM Access database, and Medicare claims data. Due to the complexity of datasets with structured data and unstructured narrative text data, both natural language processing and statistical analyses will be employed according to the purpose of the study. This project is innovative in that it explores nurse care coordination interventions that followed patients across multiple settings with the focus on management of their chronic illness care in their day to day life over a one year period in the home setting. The results of this study will add new insight to the relationships among specific patient characteristics, care coordination interventions, and patient outcomes. This new knowledge will assist decision-making of clinicians, health administrators, and policy makers with respect to health care quality, resource utilization, cost reduction, and reimbursement policy.

"Translational refinement of adaptive communication system for locked-in patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proliferation of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology promises locked-in patients potential ways to communicate successfully. Most BCI systems either involve selection from among a set of simultaneously presented stimuli, requiring extensive control of the interface; or use binary stimulus selection mechanisms that fail to achieve high communication rates because of slow intent detection or a fixed (context independent) ordering of stimuli. We propose a new interface using binary selection of text input via rapid serial visual presentation of natural language components. Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from acquired neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) and neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) drive the proposed research. Four laboratories form an alliance for this translational research project: basic research (Erdogmus, engineering; Roark, computer science and natural language processing), and clinical research (Oken, neurology/neurophysiology; Fried-Oken, augmentative communication/neurogenic communication disorders). Our aims are (1) to develop an innovative EEG-based BCI that achieves increased communication rates with fewer errors and greater satisfaction for the target SSPI populations; (2) to iteratively refine the system in the laboratory with user feedback from healthy subjects and expert LIS users of marketed AAC systems; (3) to evaluate the performance of the system within the natural clinical settings of SSPI patients. The innovative BCI is the RSVP Keyboard with three essential features: (1) rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of linguistic components ranging from letters to words to phrases; (2) a detection mechanism that employs multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and/or other suitable response mechanisms that can reliably indicate the binary intent of the user and adapt based on individualized neurophysiologic data of the user; and (3) an open-vocabulary natural language model with a capability for accurate predictions of upcoming text. Theoretical framework is based on a solid Bayesian foundation; clinical usability is based on the WHO ICF (WHO, 2001) and an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) model of participation. Rigorous experimental scrutiny in both clinical laboratory and natural settings will be obtained with able-bodied subjects and SSPI patients. Measures of learning rate, speed of message production, error rate and user satisfaction for different iterations of the RSVP keyboard will be obtained using an hypothesis-driven crossover design for 36 healthy subjects, and alternating treatment randomization design for 40 patients with SSPI. Descriptions of the motor, cognitive, and language skills of LIS patients using the novel system in their natural environments will inform clinical guidelines and functional device adaptations to better individualize treatment for children and adults with SSPI. The collaborative nature of the proposed translational research is expected to yield new knowledge for both BCI development and clinical AAC use.

"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors. In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel- Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher. An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher. In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD. Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models. This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training. To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills. In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients. Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder. Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially improve the care of these patients.","Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)",8301548,K23DK090304,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Charities', 'Chemistry', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'age related', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'career', 'computer program', 'cost', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'treatment as usual', 'trend']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2012,172287,0.010889301434663351
"Technology-Based Training for Evidence-Based Practice in Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One important barrier to the successful dissemination of evidence-based practices (EBP) in mental health is the need to train therapists effectively and affordably. To date, the most common training methods in mental health tend to lead to increases in knowledge about EBP but not to skill development or behavior change. The present study will integrate state-of-the art technologies, prior literature on therapist training, and learning theory to develop an accessible and engaging practice component for a traditional online EBP training, with the goal of increasing trainees' skill in a specific EBP in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, the proposed study will have two phases: first, it will first develop a high-quality traditional online training to teach clinicians-in-training how to conduct evidence-based suicide risk assessment. In addition, it will develop an interactive computerized practice client with whom trainees can interact in order to rehearse newly learned concepts and build skill. These training components will be developed in consultation with content and technology experts to ensure the best possible quality of trainings. In its second phase, the present study will test the acceptability and efficacy of the virtual client practice tool by randomly assigning approximately 300 clinicians in training to receive the training as usual, the traditional online training alone, or the traditional online training plus the virtual practice component. It is anticipated that trainees interacting with the practice client will report higher training satisfaction, will show higher training use, and will obtain higher scores on questionnaires and simulations measuring skill in risk assessment than trainees receiving the training as usual or the traditional online training only. Trainees' risk assessment knowledge will also be measured, although no group differences are expected in this domain. The proposed study is a randomized-controlled trial, with measures collected at baseline, post-training, and follow-up (60 days). Trainees who agree to participate will be given access to the study measures (satisfaction, knowledge, and skill) online. Training use will be unobtrusively measured through automated recording of training access data. Planned data analyses will use hierarchical linear regression to predict scores on each study outcome from group status, controlling for training program. Any variables failing a randomization check will also be controlled for. Hierarchical linear modeling will allow for analysis of repeated measures while accounting for the nested structure of the proposed dataset (trainees nested within courses). The proposed study addresses one of the four primary objectives of the NIH: to ""help close the gap between the development of new, research-tested interventions and their wide-spread use by those most in need"" (Strategic Objective 4). The proposed study is also consistent with the goal of this funding mechanism to improve the quality of the training environment. Finally, by developing a potentially cost-effective therapist training tool that can be easily deployed to remote areas, it has the potential to improve the quality of care to underserved populations and contribute to the NIH goal of eliminating health disparities.          Several specific forms of assessment and psychotherapy have been developed for common youth mental health problems, which are both science-based and known to work better than usual assessment and treatments. However, these evidence-based practices are not widely used in community agencies. This is partly because current methods for training therapists are either affordable but do not lead to changes in therapist behavior or client outcomes (e.g., brief workshops), or are effective in changing therapist behavior but are more time, resource, and cost-intensive than most agencies can afford (e.g., adequate ongoing supervision and consultation). The present study will employ advanced but widely available technologies to develop an engaging, affordable, standardized tool for training therapists that offers therapists the opportunity to practice skills repeatedly in a realistic and safe environment where they receive immediate feedback. By establishing the acceptability and feasibility of this tool, the current study has the potential to advance the field's knowledge of how to effectively train therapists in general, and of how to disseminate evidence-based practices to settings where they are most needed. In particular, if successful the proposed training practice tool can easily and affordably be deployed to even remote and rural areas to improve therapist training in those settings. As such, the proposed study could help improve the quality of care received by such typically underserved populations in order to help reduce health disparities. In addition, by applying this tool to a broad and important public health concern such as adolescent suicide risk assessment, the study also has the potential to directly enhance therapists' skill and confidence in conducting state-of-the-science, sensitive risk assessments using empirically grounded strategies, which could, in turn, help them save lives.

"Care coordination for older adults: Process, outcomes, cost    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent research provides evidence that care coordination improves outcomes such as hospitalization, rehospitalization, emergency room use, and reduces cost. One program using nurse care coordination as an intervention to improve care for community dwelling older adults' was Aging in Place (AIP) at the University of Missouri's Sinclair School of Nursing. AIP's service provider for the enhanced nurse care coordination intervention was Senior Care, a home health agency and Home and Community Based service provider. After the AIP study ended Senior Care continued to exist as a home health care (HHC) agency. Taking advantage of the unique data from the AIP study, and the HHC agency we propose to perform a secondary analysis to (1) identify care coordination interventions, intervention activities, and intervention doses used by AIP nurse care coordinators using enhanced nurse coordination, and HHC nurses providing traditional HHC , (2) describe any differences in interventions used by AIP nurse care coordinators, and HHC nurses, and finally (3) to identify whether outcomes of hospitalization, rehospitalization, emergency room use, and cost differ for older adults in the AIP and HHC groups. The original AIP analysis did not link specific nurse care coordination interventions with outcomes, identify the specific activities associated with interventions, explore intervention dose, or compare outcomes to traditional HHC. Data will compare two groups of older people who received services, those with enhanced nurse care coordination in the AIP group from the years 2000-2002 and those who received traditional HHC without enhanced nurse care coordination from the years 2003-2005. Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods will be used to identify interventions and activities nurse care coordinators used when coordinating care for older adults. NLP transforms human-generated text into machine-readable (structured) information. We propose to use a unique iterative approach to NLP in which the available activities are extracted from existing electronic medical records from Senior Care, while new activities are identified by hand from records in which not enough information was found in the first pass. After each pass, a team of experts will check the extracted activities to assure that they are relevant to care coordination. Intervention profiles that are representative for AIP and HHC will be developed by determining what types of activities occur most frequently for each intervention category and target, and which ones are most representative of the category and target. Dose profiles of interventions will be developed, and finally, outcomes of hospitalization, rehospitalization, emergency room use, and cost will be compared between the AIP and HHC groups.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study informs research and clinical practice by identifying actual care coordination intervention activities and dose, and developing intervention profiles for future use in research and practice. The Natural Language Processing method will add to our knowledge of how to successful use electronic medical record text data.              This study informs research and clinical practice by identifying actual care coordination intervention activities and dose, and developing intervention profiles for future use in research and practice.

More than half felt they were ""on duty"" 24 hours a day, and half had to end/reduce employment due to the demands of care-giving. Ingenium proposes to create a practical, self-learning, system for activity monitoring and support of elderly persons. This advanced activity monitoring combined with Ingenium's interactive communications and support system will extend independent living and the successful conduct of everyday tasks for the elderly, disabled, and soldiers with PTSD and TBI. The goal in this proposal is to produce a system that can reliably recognize activities using only one Ingenium wireless room-master per room and an Ingenium wearable wireless badge linked to an AI system with self-learning capability. This is accomplished through the interactive badge and room masters. In contrast, existing technology uses many sensors and requires off-line processing to train the activity recognizer and is not useable beyond laboratory environments. Additionally, no current commercial system has interactive planning and scheduling support. Ingenium will utilize the assistance of the AI lab staff at Washington State University which is an acknowledged leader in recognizing activities of daily living. Aim #1 will re-create the WSU technology, transfer activity knowledge to the Ingenium platform and enhance the platform with interactive self learning Aim #2 will outfit the WSU smart apartment with the Ingenium system. The smart apartment has a complex set of 37 sensors. The Ingenium system will both simplify and enhance the WSU configuration by utilizing only 7 Ingenium room-masters. Twenty students will participate in a study to verify that the Ingenium system provides superior activity location and recognition than the current wired multiple motion sensor system. Aim #3 will test the ability of the enhanced interactive prompting and learning capability of the Ingenium system to learn the same activities without the knowledge transfer hence validating a real time learning activity recognizer is possible in a commercializable system. One of goals of Ingenium's business plan is to commercialize this system. .      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Today, 60 million Americans - one in five - require assistance in their living arrangements and daily activities. These are primarily elderly individuals and persons with disabilities. By applying the latest monitoring and artificial intelligence technologies, the outcomes of this research would enable the Ingenium system to improve the quality of home and institutional health care, and at the same time, reduce the cost of providing that care. The marketplace for technology to assist the elderly will grow sharply from $2 billion today to more than $20 billion by 2020, according to new reports from Frost & Sullivan and Forester Research (Liz Boehm, Principal Analyst for Healthcare and Life Sciences) entitled ""Healthcare Unbound's Early Self-Pay Market"".           Today, 60 million Americans - one in five - require assistance in their living arrangements and daily activities.

"Predicting Care Coordination Needs of Frail Older Adults from Longitudinal Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The current health care system fails to meet the needs of most chronically ill older adults. Given that the chronically ill are the major consumers of health care dollars, development of systems that provide support in the management of the complex health care needs is critical. Care coordination is one intervention that is recognized as a mechanism to support chronically ill persons in managing their health care. However, care coordination has multiple definitions, models, providers, and settings. Most care coordination programs have been focused on specific time periods such as transition between care settings. Further, there is limited evidence about the key components of care coordination, making the content of care coordination virtually a ""black box"" although payment for care coordination is included in current health care legislation. Accordingly, the purpose of this proposed study is to examine the type and amount of nurse care coordination interventions and the relationship of these interventions to both patient characteristics and outcomes. To be specific, this study aims to  "" identify interventions used in nurse care coordination for frail older community dwelling adults;  "" identify the relationships among patient characteristics, components of nurse care coordination  intervention, and patient outcomes; and  "" develop and validate models predicting patient outcomes for frail older community dwelling adults who  received nurse care coordination interventions. This proposed study employs a secondary analysis that will examine existing datasets derived from a recent randomized controlled trial that tested the effectiveness of a home care medication management program (HCMM) for frail older adults. The datasets examined will include electronic patient records and communication logs documented through the CareFacts(R) system, HCMM Access database, and Medicare claims data. Due to the complexity of datasets with structured data and unstructured narrative text data, both natural language processing and statistical analyses will be employed according to the purpose of the study. This project is innovative in that it explores nurse care coordination interventions that followed patients across multiple settings with the focus on management of their chronic illness care in their day to day life over a one year period in the home setting. The results of this study will add new insight to the relationships among specific patient characteristics, care coordination interventions, and patient outcomes. This new knowledge will assist decision-making of clinicians, health administrators, and policy makers with respect to health care quality, resource utilization, cost reduction, and reimbursement policy. Also, the resulting predictive model will assist in clinical information system design to support clinicians' decision-making.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed study will use existing data to examine the type and amount of nurse care coordination interventions provided to frail older community dwelling adults.

"Translational refinement of adaptive communication system for locked-in patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proliferation of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology promises locked-in patients potential ways to communicate successfully. Most BCI systems either involve selection from among a set of simultaneously presented stimuli, requiring extensive control of the interface; or use binary stimulus selection mechanisms that fail to achieve high communication rates because of slow intent detection or a fixed (context independent) ordering of stimuli. We propose a new interface using binary selection of text input via rapid serial visual presentation of natural language components. Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from acquired neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) and neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) drive the proposed research. Four laboratories form an alliance for this translational research project: basic research (Erdogmus, engineering; Roark, computer science and natural language processing), and clinical research (Oken, neurology/neurophysiology; Fried-Oken, augmentative communication/neurogenic communication disorders). Our aims are (1) to develop an innovative EEG-based BCI that achieves increased communication rates with fewer errors and greater satisfaction for the target SSPI populations; (2) to iteratively refine the system in the laboratory with user feedback from healthy subjects and expert LIS users of marketed AAC systems; (3) to evaluate the performance of the system within the natural clinical settings of SSPI patients. The innovative BCI is the RSVP Keyboard with three essential features: (1) rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of linguistic components ranging from letters to words to phrases; (2) a detection mechanism that employs multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and/or other suitable response mechanisms that can reliably indicate the binary intent of the user and adapt based on individualized neurophysiologic data of the user; and (3) an open-vocabulary natural language model with a capability for accurate predictions of upcoming text. Theoretical framework is based on a solid Bayesian foundation; clinical usability is based on the WHO ICF (WHO, 2001) and an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) model of participation. Rigorous experimental scrutiny in both clinical laboratory and natural settings will be obtained with able-bodied subjects and SSPI patients. Measures of learning rate, speed of message production, error rate and user satisfaction for different iterations of the RSVP keyboard will be obtained using an hypothesis-driven crossover design for 36 healthy subjects, and alternating treatment randomization design for 40 patients with SSPI. Descriptions of the motor, cognitive, and language skills of LIS patients using the novel system in their natural environments will inform clinical guidelines and functional device adaptations to better individualize treatment for children and adults with SSPI. The collaborative nature of the proposed translational research is expected to yield new knowledge for both BCI development and clinical AAC use.    Relevance: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily care giving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The RSVP keyboard and proposed language models are innovative technological discoveries that are being applied to clinical augmentative communication tools so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care. The proposed project stresses the translation of basic computer science into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.              Public health relevance statement: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life.

"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education  with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in  clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic  kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral  funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an  independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD  care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician  (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on  experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research,  and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop  into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the  development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors.  In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and  large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel-  Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and  commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher.   An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his  research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and  the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to  develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum  chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed  logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will  conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model  in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients  for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with  an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care  delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data  mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and  implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher.   In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance  provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is  a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD.  Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of  Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in  predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical  informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a  highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise  in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the  general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and  CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of  disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models.  This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and  expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training.   To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal  coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical  Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational  Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial  implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research  and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses  that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills.   In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a  sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to  use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The  applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the  formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful  independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder.

"Automating assessment of obesity care quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current trends suggest that obesity prevalence will continue to rise and that costs of treating obesity-related disease will dramatically increase as the population ages. Despite NHLBI guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating obesity among adults, most health care systems have been slow to respond to this looming public health problem. This slow response is partly due to the inability to assess adherence to obesity diagnosis and treatment guidelines. In particular, the lack of appropriate Health IT for integrating diverse clinical data on obesity, even within state-of-the-art electronic medical record systems (EMRs), makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of care, measure the effectiveness of new intervention programs, and make rational decisions at system, organization, and individual patient levels. EMRs offer the potential to efficiently assess large populations, however much of the data necessary for obesity care assessment are unavailable to automated methods because they reside in the text clinical notes of the EMR. Previous studies have shown that although some data of interest are recorded in easily retrievable fields (e.g., body weights recorded as a vital sign; standard diagnosis codes), much of the treatment information is found only in free-text clinical notes. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient obesity care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of adult primary care from the EMR data of two distinct health systems: a   mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (OCHIN) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the West Coast states (primarily Oregon, but also Washington and California). We propose to use Health IT to integrate diverse data and knowledge that advance quality improvement for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We will first develop obesity care quality (OCQ) measures using up to-date NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the Medi Class system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify OCQ-relevant clinical events in the EMR. Then we will apply the OCQ measures to assess current levels of obesity care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the associations between OCQ measures of recommended obesity care and provider characteristics as well as clinical outcomes for patients, including change in weight.           PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will improve care for obese and overweight patients by improving the technology we use for measuring the quality of care for these populations. This study will use specialized computer programs to analyze the electronic medical records of obese and overweight patients. The results of this work will help us determine if patients from two different health care systems are receiving recommended care, and how to better monitor the delivery of care for obese and overweight patients.",Automating assessment of obesity care quality,8136907,R18HS018157,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2011,247887,0.014526648667893908
"Automatic Acquisition of Knowledge for Senior Care Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dramatic growth of the senior population in the U.S. is widely expected to challenge the capacity of this segment of the U.S. health system. Alternative strategies to support seniors living independently will be critical in meeting the short fall. My Health Care Manager (MHCM) has developed the Senior Care Navigation System (SCANSTM) to provide decision support to Geriatric Care Managers (GCMs), registered nurses and social workers, in the construction of consumer-side care plans for seniors and their caregivers. SCANSTM provides interventions and practical, real-world tools to extend the healthy and active years of life and assist families with critical decisions. Automatic acquisition of knowledge will help to augment MHCM's research staff in order to keep the SCANSTM knowledge base up to date for providing effective and efficient senior care plans. The overall goal for this Fast-Track SBIR research will be for MHCM in collaboration with the Indiana University's School of Informatics to develop an automated knowledge acquisition system that will acquire knowledge from health literature pertinent to senior care. This knowledge in the form of ""best practices"" will be used as part of the SCANSTM decision support system. The automatic acquisition of knowledge will greatly increase the overall productivity of the SCANS Research Team. The improvements in quality, timeliness, breadth, depth, and volume of research will be a marketable feature of the SCANSTM product. During Phase I, MHCM will validate the feasibility of automatically acquiring knowledge in literature for senior care planning. MHCM will develop knowledge extraction methodologies for geriatric care in Phase I and will implement 3 of 40 MHCM defined care categories. Phase II will expand on the algorithm(s) developed during Phase I to include an additional 30-37 care categories. MCHM will also develop geriatric care intervention discovery algorithms to be used in finding, updating, and evaluating new knowledge to be included in the SCANSTM knowledgebase. MHCM will verify and validate the feasibility of the knowledge acquisition methods by comparing the current manual research process with an automated acquisition process using literature. MHCM will then augment the knowledge discovered through text mining with an existing Bayesian Reasoning Network model to make the SCANS TM an efficient decision support system for geriatric care. With the completion of Phases I and II, commercialization of the knowledge acquisition system for SCANSTM can then proceed in Phase III of the project.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this Fast-Track research application is to improve the quality, depth and breadth of research reference material held in the Senior Care Navigation System, SCANS, knowledgebase used by our Geriatric Care Managers. The knowledgebase helps our GCM's to prepare comprehensive care plans for elders and their care givers covering 40 care categories. The intent is to expand the knowledge of and coordinate the services available to seniors and their families for improving their quality of life and for extending independent living.           My Health Care Manager Inc.

"Technology-Based Training for Evidence-Based Practice in Mental Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One important barrier to the successful dissemination of evidence-based practices (EBP) in mental health is the need to train therapists effectively and affordably. To date, the most common training methods in mental health tend to lead to increases in knowledge about EBP but not to skill development or behavior change. The present study will integrate state-of-the art technologies, prior literature on therapist training, and learning theory to develop an accessible and engaging practice component for a traditional online EBP training, with the goal of increasing trainees' skill in a specific EBP in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, the proposed study will have two phases: first, it will first develop a high-quality traditional online training to teach clinicians-in-training how to conduct evidence-based suicide risk assessment. In addition, it will develop an interactive computerized practice client with whom trainees can interact in order to rehearse newly learned concepts and build skill. These training components will be developed in consultation with content and technology experts to ensure the best possible quality of trainings. In its second phase, the present study will test the acceptability and efficacy of the virtual client practice tool by randomly assigning approximately 300 clinicians in training to receive the training as usual, the traditional online training alone, or the traditional online training plus the virtual practice component. It is anticipated that trainees interacting with the practice client will report higher training satisfaction, will show higher training use, and will obtain higher scores on questionnaires and simulations measuring skill in risk assessment than trainees receiving the training as usual or the traditional online training only. Trainees' risk assessment knowledge will also be measured, although no group differences are expected in this domain. The proposed study is a randomized-controlled trial, with measures collected at baseline, post-training, and follow-up (60 days). Trainees who agree to participate will be given access to the study measures (satisfaction, knowledge, and skill) online. Training use will be unobtrusively measured through automated recording of training access data. Planned data analyses will use hierarchical linear regression to predict scores on each study outcome from group status, controlling for training program. Any variables failing a randomization check will also be controlled for. Hierarchical linear modeling will allow for analysis of repeated measures while accounting for the nested structure of the proposed dataset (trainees nested within courses). The proposed study addresses one of the four primary objectives of the NIH: to ""help close the gap between the development of new, research-tested interventions and their wide-spread use by those most in need"" (Strategic Objective 4). The proposed study is also consistent with the goal of this funding mechanism to improve the quality of the training environment. Finally, by developing a potentially cost-effective therapist training tool that can be easily deployed to remote areas, it has the potential to improve the quality of care to underserved populations and contribute to the NIH goal of eliminating health disparities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Several specific forms of assessment and psychotherapy have been developed for common youth mental health problems, which are both science-based and known to work better than usual assessment and treatments. However, these evidence-based practices are not widely used in community agencies. This is partly because current methods for training therapists are either affordable but do not lead to changes in therapist behavior or client outcomes (e.g., brief workshops), or are effective in changing therapist behavior but are more time, resource, and cost-intensive than most agencies can afford (e.g., adequate ongoing supervision and consultation). The present study will employ advanced but widely available technologies to develop an engaging, affordable, standardized tool for training therapists that offers therapists the opportunity to practice skills repeatedly in a realistic and safe environment where they receive immediate feedback. By establishing the acceptability and feasibility of this tool, the current study has the potential to advance the field's knowledge of how to effectively train therapists in general, and of how to disseminate evidence-based practices to settings where they are most needed. In particular, if successful the proposed training practice tool can easily and affordably be deployed to even remote and rural areas to improve therapist training in those settings. As such, the proposed study could help improve the quality of care received by such typically underserved populations in order to help reduce health disparities. In addition, by applying this tool to a broad and important public health concern such as adolescent suicide risk assessment, the study also has the potential to directly enhance therapists' skill and confidence in conducting state-of-the-science, sensitive risk assessments using empirically grounded strategies, which could, in turn, help them save lives.                Several specific forms of assessment and psychotherapy have been developed for common youth mental health problems, which are both science-based and known to work better than usual assessment and treatments.

"Translational refinement of adaptive communication system for locked-in patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proliferation of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology promises locked-in patients potential ways to communicate successfully. Most BCI systems either involve selection from among a set of simultaneously presented stimuli, requiring extensive control of the interface; or use binary stimulus selection mechanisms that fail to achieve high communication rates because of slow intent detection or a fixed (context independent) ordering of stimuli. We propose a new interface using binary selection of text input via rapid serial visual presentation of natural language components. Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from acquired neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) and neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) drive the proposed research. Four laboratories form an alliance for this translational research project: basic research (Erdogmus, engineering; Roark, computer science and natural language processing), and clinical research (Oken, neurology/neurophysiology; Fried-Oken, augmentative communication/neurogenic communication disorders). Our aims are (1) to develop an innovative EEG-based BCI that achieves increased communication rates with fewer errors and greater satisfaction for the target SSPI populations; (2) to iteratively refine the system in the laboratory with user feedback from healthy subjects and expert LIS users of marketed AAC systems; (3) to evaluate the performance of the system within the natural clinical settings of SSPI patients. The innovative BCI is the RSVP Keyboard with three essential features: (1) rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of linguistic components ranging from letters to words to phrases; (2) a detection mechanism that employs multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and/or other suitable response mechanisms that can reliably indicate the binary intent of the user and adapt based on individualized neurophysiologic data of the user; and (3) an open-vocabulary natural language model with a capability for accurate predictions of upcoming text. Theoretical framework is based on a solid Bayesian foundation; clinical usability is based on the WHO ICF (WHO, 2001) and an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) model of participation. Rigorous experimental scrutiny in both clinical laboratory and natural settings will be obtained with able-bodied subjects and SSPI patients. Measures of learning rate, speed of message production, error rate and user satisfaction for different iterations of the RSVP keyboard will be obtained using an hypothesis-driven crossover design for 36 healthy subjects, and alternating treatment randomization design for 40 patients with SSPI. Descriptions of the motor, cognitive, and language skills of LIS patients using the novel system in their natural environments will inform clinical guidelines and functional device adaptations to better individualize treatment for children and adults with SSPI. The collaborative nature of the proposed translational research is expected to yield new knowledge for both BCI development and clinical AAC use.    Relevance: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily care giving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The RSVP keyboard and proposed language models are innovative technological discoveries that are being applied to clinical augmentative communication tools so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care. The proposed project stresses the translation of basic computer science into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.              Public health relevance statement: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life.

"Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness    DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant):  Progress in cancer genomics offers the possibility of ushering in a new era of personalized medicine. Specifically in cancer, different cancers can now be distinguished by their molecular profile. In the past, the diagnostic classification of a cancer was based on the origin or the location of the tissue in the body. Due to the progress of molecular profiling, cancers now can be classified according to the genes expressed by tumor cells. Several studies have demonstrated the significance of genomics for predicting optimal therapies or treatments. However, few of these discoveries are in use for patient care. One issue is the need to validate preliminary results on a patient population that is representative of health care delivery. This requires new infrastructure that integrates retrospective and prospective studies to study the question of efficacy and effectiveness of these new interventions. The issue of efficacy versus effectiveness in personalized medicine is addressed in a research cycle starting at hypothesis generation (e.g. from existing medical records, registry data, etc.), followed by testing in a controlled setting (e.g. preferably in a randomized controlled trial if applicable, or matching the research question to the best study design etc.), and evaluated again in well designed large prospective observational studies.      The Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) is a national leader in the personalized cancer care arena through the visionary approach of Total Cancer Care(tm) (TCC(tm)). By leveraging a partnership with Merck Pharmaceuticals, and with generous support from the State of Florida, Hillsborough County, and the city of Tampa, MCC launched a new corporation called M2Gen to help discover molecular signatures to guide the right care, for the right patient, at the right time. Key to the success of this endeavor is the accrual of over 100,000 cancer patients (more than 33,000 accrued to date), from multiple consortium sites, into a prospective study to collect tumor material, blood, detailed personal and medical histories, and outcome data. These resources are galvanized by a data warehouse infrastructure that integrates patient, pathological, molecular and radiological data, enabling the discovery of new therapy and treatment paradigms to improve the quality of cancer patient care.      The purpose of this Grand Opportunity proposal is to enhance the TCC infrastructure to support Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) for cancer diseases. In collaboration with the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC), the MCC will integrate the TRIPS natural language processing technology to capture discrete data elements from unstructured data currently only available through chart abstraction. These data will be added to existing elements within the MCC data warehouse. A CER data mart will be constructed from the MCC data warehouse and end-user interfaces will provide access to heterogeneous data for research and clinicians. Although infrastructure enhancements provide the foundation for data capture and storage, additional informatics principles will be studied to determine how data, such as genetic signatures from microarray data, can be represented in a data warehouse, how to assign data metrics that enhance knowledge about each data element and investigate the level of data quality required for meaningful CER. Additionally, CER metadata standards and a comprehensive CER data dictionary will be created to support the use of the emerging infrastructure. Leading-edge clinical trials at MCC will be modeled using Value of Information analyses to understand how new data types will assist with designing and performing trials in silico. Other integrated data will be studied using statistical and systematic review methodologies that will allow CER researchers to begin assessing the developing CER infrastructure. For example, researchers can compare patients enrolled in clinical trials with patients having similar diagnoses treated with standard of care. Using an iterative approach, the development of the infrastructure can be constantly improved during the project period. This unique approach to enhancing current infrastructure using CER methodologies will create a robust infrastructure for cancer CER and will leverage the significant investment and resources available through TCC and the MCC.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The CER grant proposal ""Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness Research"" will aid public health in several ways. First, the development of CER infrastructure will give biomedical researchers a resource that will integrate heterogeneous patient care data from multiple sources and allow for analyses to compare different treatments for the same disease. The CER infrastructure will eventually assist researchers and medical professionals with making evidence-based decisions about the best methods of care for each patient. Second, the proposal will develop vocabulary, metadata and data representation standards focused on CER that will provide guidance for health information technology (HIT) infrastructure that is challenged with interoperability standards. By working with a seventeen-hospital consortium the interoperability of these standards can be tested within an established health care network that is already exchanging patient data that is stored in a central data warehouse. Finally, the proposal will merge a strong program in personalized health care and CER. The integration of these two areas will provide a unique opportunity to identify subpopulations that may benefit from specific treatments and to begin tailoring medical care based on molecular markers to more accurately diagnosis the disease and have markers to monitor disease progression. The successful completion of the goals outlined in this project will provide far-reaching impact to CER efforts and the broader health care community.           NARRATIVE: The CER grant proposal ""Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness Research"" will aid public health in several ways.

"Automating assessment of obesity care quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current trends suggest that obesity prevalence will continue to rise and that costs of treating obesity-related disease will dramatically increase as the population ages. Despite NHLBI guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating obesity among adults, most health care systems have been slow to respond to this looming public health problem. This slow response is partly due to the inability to assess adherence to obesity diagnosis and treatment guidelines. In particular, the lack of appropriate Health IT for integrating diverse clinical data on obesity, even within state-of-the-art electronic medical record systems (EMRs), makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of care, measure the effectiveness of new intervention programs, and make rational decisions at system, organization, and individual patient levels. EMRs offer the potential to efficiently assess large populations, however much of the data necessary for obesity care assessment are unavailable to automated methods because they reside in the text clinical notes of the EMR. Previous studies have shown that although some data of interest are recorded in easily retrievable fields (e.g., body weights recorded as a vital sign; standard diagnosis codes), much of the treatment information is found only in free-text clinical notes. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient obesity care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of adult primary care from the EMR data of two distinct health systems: a   mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (OCHIN) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the West Coast states (primarily Oregon, but also Washington and California). We propose to use Health IT to integrate diverse data and knowledge that advance quality improvement for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We will first develop obesity care quality (OCQ) measures using up to-date NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the Medi Class system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify OCQ-relevant clinical events in the EMR. Then we will apply the OCQ measures to assess current levels of obesity care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the associations between OCQ measures of recommended obesity care and provider characteristics as well as clinical outcomes for patients, including change in weight.           PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will improve care for obese and overweight patients by improving the technology we use for measuring the quality of care for these populations. This study will use specialized computer programs to analyze the electronic medical records of obese and overweight patients. The results of this work will help us determine if patients from two different health care systems are receiving recommended care, and how to better monitor the delivery of care for obese and overweight patients.",Automating assessment of obesity care quality,7941068,R18HS018157,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2010,496075,0.014526648667893908
"Automatic Acquisition of Knowledge for Senior Care Planning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dramatic growth of the senior population in the U.S. is widely expected to challenge the capacity of this segment of the U.S. health system. Alternative strategies to support seniors living independently will be critical in meeting the short fall. My Health Care Manager (MHCM) has developed the Senior Care Navigation System (SCANSTM) to provide decision support to Geriatric Care Managers (GCMs), registered nurses and social workers, in the construction of consumer-side care plans for seniors and their caregivers. SCANSTM provides interventions and practical, real-world tools to extend the healthy and active years of life and assist families with critical decisions. Automatic acquisition of knowledge will help to augment MHCM's research staff in order to keep the SCANSTM knowledge base up to date for providing effective and efficient senior care plans. The overall goal for this Fast-Track SBIR research will be for MHCM in collaboration with the Indiana University's School of Informatics to develop an automated knowledge acquisition system that will acquire knowledge from health literature pertinent to senior care. This knowledge in the form of ""best practices"" will be used as part of the SCANSTM decision support system. The automatic acquisition of knowledge will greatly increase the overall productivity of the SCANS Research Team. The improvements in quality, timeliness, breadth, depth, and volume of research will be a marketable feature of the SCANSTM product. During Phase I, MHCM will validate the feasibility of automatically acquiring knowledge in literature for senior care planning. MHCM will develop knowledge extraction methodologies for geriatric care in Phase I and will implement 3 of 40 MHCM defined care categories. Phase II will expand on the algorithm(s) developed during Phase I to include an additional 30-37 care categories. MCHM will also develop geriatric care intervention discovery algorithms to be used in finding, updating, and evaluating new knowledge to be included in the SCANSTM knowledgebase. MHCM will verify and validate the feasibility of the knowledge acquisition methods by comparing the current manual research process with an automated acquisition process using literature. MHCM will then augment the knowledge discovered through text mining with an existing Bayesian Reasoning Network model to make the SCANS TM an efficient decision support system for geriatric care. With the completion of Phases I and II, commercialization of the knowledge acquisition system for SCANSTM can then proceed in Phase III of the project.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this Fast-Track research application is to improve the quality, depth and breadth of research reference material held in the Senior Care Navigation System, SCANS, knowledgebase used by our Geriatric Care Managers. The knowledgebase helps our GCM's to prepare comprehensive care plans for elders and their care givers covering 40 care categories. The intent is to expand the knowledge of and coordinate the services available to seniors and their families for improving their quality of life and for extending independent living.           My Health Care Manager Inc.

"Multi-institutional Consortium for CER in Diabetes Treatment and Prevention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary /Abstract: The HMO Research Network's (HMORN) Diabetes Multi-Center Research Consortium (DMCRC) Coordinating Center proposes to build a national research network and a multi-system distributed database for conducting comparative effectiveness research (CER) in the treatment and prevention of diabetes mellitus. The network is comprised of 31 investigators from 12 integrated healthcare delivery systems and academic institutions who study diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus, childhood and adult obesity, weight management, medical informatics and biostatistics. The network has broad experience conducting system-based interventions to improve treatment of diabetes or to support lifestyle changes to prevent diabetes, as well as broad experience conducting CER. The 12-system database will capture and standardize detailed demographic and longitudinal electronic health record (EHR)-derived clinical data on more than 750,000 persons with diabetes and a much larger membership without diabetes. Once constructed, the database will be used to conduct and publish surveillance data on trends (2005- 2012) in the incidence, prevalence, treatment and outcomes of diabetes in this population. It will also be used to conduct two CER studies. The first is a cluster randomized, multi-system intervention that will rapidly identify diabetes patients with ""early nonadherence"" to newly prescribed anti-diabetic, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering medications. Early nonadherence refers to patient failure to fill either the first prescription of a new medication or the first refill, and has been shown to be more frequent than ""ongoing"" nonadherence. This information will be provided to population management outreach teams in 3-5 health systems via the EHR or other electronic database, along with training in counseling patients on adherence problems. Study outcomes of subsequent risk factor change and adherence to the new medication will be compared within each system to those for patients on teams that do not receive the new information. The second CER study is an observational evaluation of various communication, counseling and referral strategies as provided to women who have had an abnormal glucose test (fasting glucose or oral glucose tolerance test) in the first 6 months after a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and who are therefore at very high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes. Study outcomes include weight change over one year and self-reported physical activity four months after the abnormal test. In each study, we will collect process of care data by applying natural language processing (NLP) to clinical text in EHRs and survey patients for information on demographic, clinical, and behavioral variables. These NLP-derived and patient-reported variables will be studied as possible mediators of treatment effectiveness or as potential modifiers of effectiveness (i.e. variables that identify patient subgroups that benefit less from usual interventions. Variables that prove to be important as mediators or modifiers may be good candidates for routine collection and incorporation into EHR's and/or future diabetes registries.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A network of 32 health services and intervention scientists affiliated with the HMO Research Network propose to build a national database for conducting comparative effectiveness research on treatment and on approaches to preventing diabetes mellitus. The database will include information on more than 750,000 persons with diabetes. It will be used to generate ongoing information on the occurrence, treatments and outcomes of diabetes and to conduct 2 studies of approaches to treating and preventing this condition.           Project Narrative A network of 32 health services and intervention scientists affiliated with the HMO Research Network propose to build a national database for conducting comparative effectiveness research on treatment and on approaches to preventing diabetes mellitus.

"Substance Abuse Continuing Care through Mobile Assessment and Messaging. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase I SBIR application entitled ""Substance Abuse Continuing Care through Mobile Assessment and Messaging"" is designed to create a low cost, continuous care decision support text messaging intervention to increase treatment adherence, decrease drop-out and prevent the recurrence of problem drug use during and following professionally facilitated addiction treatment. Based on the high drop-out rates during treatment and relapse rates following treatment, it has been proposed that addiction should be treated similarly to other chronic illnesses that require long-term intensive monitoring and care. Recent research on adaptive phone-based continuing care interventions supports the use of a chronic care addictions treatment model both for those attempting to change illicit substance abuse and society as a whole. There is an emerging literature on the use of text messaging and ecological momentary assessment through mobile phones for low cost automated disease management of chronic illnesses like asthma and diabetes. Text messaging is ideally suited to addiction continuous care because the mobile phone is capable of providing low cost adaptive monitoring and feedback wherever and whenever relapse is most likely to occur. The proposed study is designed to develop the content, structure, programming and user interface of an automated interactive drug treatment continuous care text messaging intervention that can be modulated by the severity of symptoms during and following substance abuse treatment. The intervention will include web-based assessment, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), adaptive supportive messaging based on assessment results and counselor/social network alerts. The intervention is designed to both retain persons in treatment and help them sustain long-term change following treatment. We will obtain outside feedback and review of the preliminary intervention through focus groups with a heterogeneous group of clients enrolled in substance abuse treatment. Thought leaders with expertise in addiction, continuous care, text messaging and ecological momentary assessment will help develop the core content and features of the intervention. Specific content and programming benchmarks for success will determine Phase II feasibility. If successful this messaging program has the potential to significantly improve outcomes for the 2.2 million chronic illicit substance users who seek treatment each year without the financial burden and/or time commitment needed to implement traditional counselor based continuing care interventions. Additionally, the program can be used by clients of private addiction specialists and could be adapted to reach substance abusers in earlier stages of change as a stepped care intervention. Despite the emerging literature on the importance and effectiveness of continuing care  interventions for drug abuse, few treatment programs implement these strategies into care  due to lack of resources and financial incentive. We propose to create a low cost adaptive  continuing care text messaging support and monitoring program through the mobile phone  to help reduce drug abuse treatment drop-out and relapse among illicit drug users  attempting to change. If study aims are achieved, the proposed intervention could be easily  disseminated to providers, improve long-term psychosocial and health outcomes for  substance users and reduce overall healthcare costs related to substance abuse.",Substance Abuse Continuing Care through Mobile Assessment and Messaging.,7998538,R43DA029359,"['Abstinence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asthma', 'Back', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Care', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Management', 'Drops', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health behavior', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Care', 'Marketing', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Social Network', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Structure', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'addiction', 'base', 'cost', 'data management', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'financial incentive', 'improved', 'meetings', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'substance abuse treatment', 'substance abuser', 'success', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment program', 'volunteer']",NIDA,"MOBILE HEALTH INTERVENTIONS, LLC",R43,2010,119348,-0.03944668867346627
"Translational refinement of adaptive communication system for locked-in patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proliferation of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology promises locked-in patients potential ways to communicate successfully. Most BCI systems either involve selection from among a set of simultaneously presented stimuli, requiring extensive control of the interface; or use binary stimulus selection mechanisms that fail to achieve high communication rates because of slow intent detection or a fixed (context independent) ordering of stimuli. We propose a new interface using binary selection of text input via rapid serial visual presentation of natural language components. Individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from acquired neurological disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury) and neurodevelopmental disorders (cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) drive the proposed research. Four laboratories form an alliance for this translational research project: basic research (Erdogmus, engineering; Roark, computer science and natural language processing), and clinical research (Oken, neurology/neurophysiology; Fried-Oken, augmentative communication/neurogenic communication disorders). Our aims are (1) to develop an innovative EEG-based BCI that achieves increased communication rates with fewer errors and greater satisfaction for the target SSPI populations; (2) to iteratively refine the system in the laboratory with user feedback from healthy subjects and expert LIS users of marketed AAC systems; (3) to evaluate the performance of the system within the natural clinical settings of SSPI patients. The innovative BCI is the RSVP Keyboard with three essential features: (1) rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of linguistic components ranging from letters to words to phrases; (2) a detection mechanism that employs multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and/or other suitable response mechanisms that can reliably indicate the binary intent of the user and adapt based on individualized neurophysiologic data of the user; and (3) an open-vocabulary natural language model with a capability for accurate predictions of upcoming text. Theoretical framework is based on a solid Bayesian foundation; clinical usability is based on the WHO ICF (WHO, 2001) and an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) model of participation. Rigorous experimental scrutiny in both clinical laboratory and natural settings will be obtained with able-bodied subjects and SSPI patients. Measures of learning rate, speed of message production, error rate and user satisfaction for different iterations of the RSVP keyboard will be obtained using an hypothesis-driven crossover design for 36 healthy subjects, and alternating treatment randomization design for 40 patients with SSPI. Descriptions of the motor, cognitive, and language skills of LIS patients using the novel system in their natural environments will inform clinical guidelines and functional device adaptations to better individualize treatment for children and adults with SSPI. The collaborative nature of the proposed translational research is expected to yield new knowledge for both BCI development and clinical AAC use.    Relevance: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily care giving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The RSVP keyboard and proposed language models are innovative technological discoveries that are being applied to clinical augmentative communication tools so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care. The proposed project stresses the translation of basic computer science into clinical care, supporting the proposed NIH Roadmap and public health initiatives.              Public health relevance statement: The populations of patients with locked-in syndrome are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life.

"Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness    DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant):  Progress in cancer genomics offers the possibility of ushering in a new era of personalized medicine. Specifically in cancer, different cancers can now be distinguished by their molecular profile. In the past, the diagnostic classification of a cancer was based on the origin or the location of the tissue in the body. Due to the progress of molecular profiling, cancers now can be classified according to the genes expressed by tumor cells. Several studies have demonstrated the significance of genomics for predicting optimal therapies or treatments. However, few of these discoveries are in use for patient care. One issue is the need to validate preliminary results on a patient population that is representative of health care delivery. This requires new infrastructure that integrates retrospective and prospective studies to study the question of efficacy and effectiveness of these new interventions. The issue of efficacy versus effectiveness in personalized medicine is addressed in a research cycle starting at hypothesis generation (e.g. from existing medical records, registry data, etc.), followed by testing in a controlled setting (e.g. preferably in a randomized controlled trial if applicable, or matching the research question to the best study design etc.), and evaluated again in well designed large prospective observational studies.      The Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) is a national leader in the personalized cancer care arena through the visionary approach of Total Cancer Care(tm) (TCC(tm)). By leveraging a partnership with Merck Pharmaceuticals, and with generous support from the State of Florida, Hillsborough County, and the city of Tampa, MCC launched a new corporation called M2Gen to help discover molecular signatures to guide the right care, for the right patient, at the right time. Key to the success of this endeavor is the accrual of over 100,000 cancer patients (more than 33,000 accrued to date), from multiple consortium sites, into a prospective study to collect tumor material, blood, detailed personal and medical histories, and outcome data. These resources are galvanized by a data warehouse infrastructure that integrates patient, pathological, molecular and radiological data, enabling the discovery of new therapy and treatment paradigms to improve the quality of cancer patient care.      The purpose of this Grand Opportunity proposal is to enhance the TCC infrastructure to support Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) for cancer diseases. In collaboration with the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC), the MCC will integrate the TRIPS natural language processing technology to capture discrete data elements from unstructured data currently only available through chart abstraction. These data will be added to existing elements within the MCC data warehouse. A CER data mart will be constructed from the MCC data warehouse and end-user interfaces will provide access to heterogeneous data for research and clinicians. Although infrastructure enhancements provide the foundation for data capture and storage, additional informatics principles will be studied to determine how data, such as genetic signatures from microarray data, can be represented in a data warehouse, how to assign data metrics that enhance knowledge about each data element and investigate the level of data quality required for meaningful CER. Additionally, CER metadata standards and a comprehensive CER data dictionary will be created to support the use of the emerging infrastructure. Leading-edge clinical trials at MCC will be modeled using Value of Information analyses to understand how new data types will assist with designing and performing trials in silico. Other integrated data will be studied using statistical and systematic review methodologies that will allow CER researchers to begin assessing the developing CER infrastructure. For example, researchers can compare patients enrolled in clinical trials with patients having similar diagnoses treated with standard of care. Using an iterative approach, the development of the infrastructure can be constantly improved during the project period. This unique approach to enhancing current infrastructure using CER methodologies will create a robust infrastructure for cancer CER and will leverage the significant investment and resources available through TCC and the MCC.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The CER grant proposal ""Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness Research"" will aid public health in several ways. First, the development of CER infrastructure will give biomedical researchers a resource that will integrate heterogeneous patient care data from multiple sources and allow for analyses to compare different treatments for the same disease. The CER infrastructure will eventually assist researchers and medical professionals with making evidence-based decisions about the best methods of care for each patient. Second, the proposal will develop vocabulary, metadata and data representation standards focused on CER that will provide guidance for health information technology (HIT) infrastructure that is challenged with interoperability standards. By working with a seventeen-hospital consortium the interoperability of these standards can be tested within an established health care network that is already exchanging patient data that is stored in a central data warehouse. Finally, the proposal will merge a strong program in personalized health care and CER. The integration of these two areas will provide a unique opportunity to identify subpopulations that may benefit from specific treatments and to begin tailoring medical care based on molecular markers to more accurately diagnosis the disease and have markers to monitor disease progression. The successful completion of the goals outlined in this project will provide far-reaching impact to CER efforts and the broader health care community.           NARRATIVE: The CER grant proposal ""Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness Research"" will aid public health in several ways.

The system will quickly elicit the most critical information about a patient's condition and then summarize those findings, in real time, to the triage nurse who can then prioritize patients based on his/her training and the resources available within the department at the time. Although many emergency departments have live interpreters to help communicate with patients who cannot speak English, those interpreters may not be available immediately to assist as soon as a patient arrives in the emergency department. In areas of the country where multiple languages are spoken, the hospital may not have interpreter in all needed languages. The ability to quickly understand the patient's chief complaint and prioritize care is the objective of triaging in the emergency department.

"Automating assessment of obesity care quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current trends suggest that obesity prevalence will continue to rise and that costs of treating obesity-related disease will dramatically increase as the population ages. Despite NHLBI guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating obesity among adults, most health care systems have been slow to respond to this looming public health problem. This slow response is partly due to the inability to assess adherence to obesity diagnosis and treatment guidelines. In particular, the lack of appropriate Health IT for integrating diverse clinical data on obesity, even within state-of-the-art electronic medical record systems (EMRs), makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of care, measure the effectiveness of new intervention programs, and make rational decisions at system, organization, and individual patient levels. EMRs offer the potential to efficiently assess large populations, however much of the data necessary for obesity care assessment are unavailable to automated methods because they reside in the text clinical notes of the EMR. Previous studies have shown that although some data of interest are recorded in easily retrievable fields (e.g., body weights recorded as a vital sign; standard diagnosis codes), much of the treatment information is found only in free-text clinical notes. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient obesity care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of adult primary care from the EMR data of two distinct health systems: a   mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (OCHIN) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the West Coast states (primarily Oregon, but also Washington and California). We propose to use Health IT to integrate diverse data and knowledge that advance quality improvement for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We will first develop obesity care quality (OCQ) measures using up to-date NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the Medi Class system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify OCQ-relevant clinical events in the EMR. Then we will apply the OCQ measures to assess current levels of obesity care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the associations between OCQ measures of recommended obesity care and provider characteristics as well as clinical outcomes for patients, including change in weight.           PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will improve care for obese and overweight patients by improving the technology we use for measuring the quality of care for these populations. This study will use specialized computer programs to analyze the electronic medical records of obese and overweight patients. The results of this work will help us determine if patients from two different health care systems are receiving recommended care, and how to better monitor the delivery of care for obese and overweight patients.",Automating assessment of obesity care quality,7761795,R18HS018157,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2009,447671,0.014526648667893908
"Intelligent Mobil Antiretroviral Adherence Coach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Technology Developed: We propose to develop the Intelligent Mobile Antiretroviral Adherence Coach (IMAAC), which is an easy- to-use, mobile software system for enhancing adherence to antiretroviral medication. The IMAAC, which will run on industry standard personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones, combines an adherence knowledgebase founded on cognitive-behavioral principals, intelligent interaction and reasoning capabilities, and a patient model adapted for each individual user. It will learn an individual's behavioral response patterns and provide alternative solutions known to improve or enhance medication adherence. The innovation of this product is its ability to adapt to individual user characteristics and generate personalized intelligent interactive guidance based on cognitive-behavioral principles. This will enhance its utility for long-term maintenance of behavior change. The delivery of the application on standard PDAs and cell phones minimizes costs. It also helps users maintain privacy by not drawing the attention a person may get carrying a specialized device. Phase I efforts will focus on the feasibility and acceptability of the IMAAC. In Phase II, we will fully develop the system and compare its efficacy to a control group of patients receiving standard-of-care. Uses of Technology/Products/Service: At the end of 2005, an estimated 1,205,969 persons in the United States were living with HIV/AIDS. By 1998, the number of patients ever receiving ART increased to 71%, however only 53% of these individuals reported receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) during a second follow-up interview suggesting that while most individuals receiving care for HIV in the United States have taken ART, continuing its use is problematic for a significant proportion of individuals. This is troubling because there is overwhelming evidence that ART reduces morbidity and mortality associated with HIV/AIDS. Research has found that behavioral interventions are successful at enhancing adherence to complicated antiretroviral medication regimens. One of the reasons behavioral interventions are successful is the feedback and support individuals get while they are engaging in a behavioral intervention along with information and strategies to support lifestyle changes. The problem with previous behaviorally-based programs is that they are time limited, whereas ART adherence is a long-term and life-long endeavor for individuals infected with HIV. Developing an innovative system that is based on cognitive-behavioral principles that can be tailored to an individual so that the program actually adapts to individual changes over time is likely to facilitate and maintain significant adherence among diverse HIV infected populations. Performigence Corporation's technology provides the capability to represent an adherence knowledgebase based on cognitive-behavioral principles and deliver intelligent interaction so that the user's physiological model can be understood and the guidance can be adapted through behavioral and life style intelligence. The IMAAC offers a convenient and sophisticated method for individuals to access empirically validated methods of ART adherence that are continually tailored to their needs and circumstances. Benefit to Company: Once the prototype is developed, Phase II funds will be sought after to complete development and test the efficacy of the system. With Phase I and Phase II funding from the STTR program, Performigence will be able to address ART adherence among HIV-positive individuals with a system that combines portability, intelligent interaction, ease of use, and low cost of consumer electronics with cognitive-behavioral principles. While this system is being designed to improve ART adherence among HIV-positive populations, the public health significance of this project is quite high because this system can be easily modified to address other chronic conditions that rely heavily on lifestyle changes such as diabetes and obesity. Both conditions increase morbidity and mortality across all age and ethnic groups in the United States. How Product Will Be Commercialized: Performigence's proprietary software technology will be used as the foundation for IMAAC development. The system will be sold to medical, industrial, research and consumer markets. It is anticipated that the IMAAC will have widespread uptake and use by consumers as well as physicians. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Developing a system that can be used with hand-held devices like telephones or personal digital assistants (PDAs) that can be tailored to an individual to provide motivational messages, behavioral cues, factual information, interactive guidance and reinforcement would likely increase antiretroviral adherence, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality associated with HIV/AIDS. Additionally, the system would be a cost-effective method to provide information to medical providers to enhance treatment and care. Modifications to such a system could be made to meet the needs of other chronic diseases that require behavioral and lifestyle changes, making the utility of the system wide-ranging.           Developing a system that can be used with hand-held devices like telephones or personal digital assistants (PDAs) that can be tailored to an individual to provide motivational messages, behavioral cues, factual information, interactive guidance and reinforcement would likely increase antiretroviral adherence, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality associated with HIV/AIDS.

"Seamos Activas: Increasing Activity Among Latinas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary lifestyle is directly associated with disease and reduced quality of life. While the general United States population is suffering from an epidemic of sedentary lifestyle, Latinos are even more sedentary than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Notably, Latinos suffer from greater rates of morbidity and mortality of conditions associated with being sedentary than non-Hispanic whites. One concern is that due to cultural artifacts, socioeconomic circumstances, and language barriers, Latinos have limited access to public health interventions that promote active lifestyles. Modern behavioral informatics interventions that use theory-based computer-run expert systems show great promise to provide more effective interventions for hard-to-reach populations at lower cost. The present application is in response to PA-04-153, 'Health Disparities Among Minority and Underserved Women.' We aim to both culturally and linguistically modify an evidence-based, inidvidually tailored intervention, founded on the Transtheoretical Model and Social Cognitive Theory, to target sedentary Latinas. This print-based, expert system intervention has been developed and tested by Dr. Bess Marcus and her team, who have spent 18 years developing programs to increase physical activity in sedentary adults. The study will involve two phases: 1) a formative research period in which 100 Latinas will be recruited to provide data on how to modify the current tailored intervention to be culturally congruent and 2) a pilot randomized trial with 80 recruited Latinas to test the modified intervention against off-the-shelf bilingual health educational materials for Latinas. The formative research phase will involve an iterative process of qualitative data collection and intervention modification, with: 1) translation from English to Spanish; 2) an initial round of exploratory focus groups to obtain data on unique themes to include in the modified intervention; 3) a second round of confirmatory focus groups to examine responses to modified intervention materials; and 4) a series of intensive individual cognitive interviews to examine readability and comprehension, consistency of perception of materials with theory, and conceptual integrity of the intervention materials across English and Spanish. The pilot study will provide data on feasibility as well as on effect size of the modified intervention to inform a future clinical trial. Secondary analyses will explore differences in intervention effect based on levels of acculturation and of ethnic identity.             n/a",Seamos Activas: Increasing Activity Among Latinas,7197865,R21NR009864,"['Hispanic Americans', 'artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'focus groups', 'lifestyle', 'public health']",NINR,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R21,2006,210300,-0.0005250303565811727

"Individualized Expert Systems for Weight Management   DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): The prevalence of overweight and obesity        has increased dramatically over the last two decades.

"Sedation Management in Pediatric Patients supported on * DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this two-year project is to pilot test an intervention to change sedation management in pediatric patients supported on mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). While ensuring patient comfort is an integral part of pediatric critical care, analgesic and sedative use in this patient population can be associated with iatrogenic injury; specifically, comfort medications may depress spontaneous ventilation and prolong the duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation. Additionally, drug tolerance develops over time and may precipitate iatrogenic abstinence syndrome when the patient no longer requires sedation. Alternatively, suboptimal comfort management contributes to ventilator dysynchrony and unplanned endotracheal extubation. Our group has developed and validated a nurse-implemented sedation algorithm to guide titration of comfort medications that may optimize patient comfort and reduce the risk of under-medication, but this algorithm needs to be evaluated further. We will pilot test the sedation algorithm in a randomized controlled clinical trial of two matched pediatric intensive care units in two different hospitals. One hospital will be randomized to their usual standard practices for managing sedation, while the other will receive (a) multidisciplinary team education and consensus building, (b) multidisciplinary team identification of the patient's trajectory of illness and daily prescription of a sedation goal, (c) a nurse-implemented sedation algorithm to guide titration of comfort medications, and (d) team feedback on clinical performance.      We hypothesize that pediatric patients managed per sedation protocol will experience fewer days of mechanical ventilation than patients receiving usual care. Secondary outcomes include time to recovery from acute lung injury, duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation, occurrence of adverse events, total exposure to comfort medications, occurrence of iatrogenic opioid and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms, PICU length of stay, barriers to successful implementation of the intervention and PICU costs.    The overall objective of this study is to develop an intervention that can be implemented in any PICU that will provide comfort to intubated and mechanically ventilated infants and children that will not cause them harm. Results of this pilot study will be used to design a future multi-center randomized controlled clinical trial. n/a",Sedation Management in Pediatric Patients supported on *,6796829,R21HD045020,"['adult respiratory distress syndrome', 'artificial intelligence', 'benzodiazepines', 'children', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'drug withdrawal', 'health care quality', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'iatrogenic disease', 'intensive care', 'lung injury', 'nurse role', 'nursing education', 'opiate alkaloid', 'outcomes research', 'patient care management', 'patient oriented research', 'pediatrics', 'respirators', 'sensory depression', 'therapy adverse effect']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL BOSTON,R21,2004,176460,0.0005547882271841137

The research aims of this              randomized clinical trial involving over 800 at-risk Washington, D.C.-area       families of 7 to 11 year olds in components of the 16 week Strengthening         Families Program (SFP) are:  1) to test the differential efficacy of the         three major components of SFP-parent training (PT), children's skills            training (CT), and family skills training (FT) compared to a minimal contact     control (MT) on precursors and substance use/abuse employing a 2 x 4             experimental design; 2) to estimate the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness      of the SFP components with 400 African American families and 400 White           families; and 3) to empirically test several competing etiological and           intervention theories of drug use/abuse underlying the intervention design       by analyzing the survey research data from 1,600 12 to 19 year olds and the      800 intervention families using structural equation modeling, mediational        analysis, hierarchical linear modeling, latent growth modeling, and              transactional modeling (cross-lagged SEM, artificial intelligence, and           neural network simulations) for gender, race, and other sub-groups.  The         rationale for the component design is that a major question exists               concerning the efficacy of child-only interventions that group high-risk         children together as well as the added benefit of working with the family        together compared to parent-training only.

"INTELLIGENT CRITIQUING OF CLINICAL-GUIDELINE APPLICATION Clinical guidelines are a powerful method for standardization and uniform improvement of the quality of medical care.  In the proposed research project, which we call Asgaard/DeGel, we will design and implement software solutions that support the design, application, and, in particular, quality assessment of the application of clinical guidelines by care providers.  Our long-term objectives include provision of a standardized computational framework for specification, application, and runtime as well as retrospective quality assessment of clinical-guidelines. We will provide these solutions by using a novel framework for specification and interpretation of clinical guidelines.  The new framework encodes explicitly both the therapeutic actions indicated by the guideline and the intermediate clinical process and outcome goals of the guideline designers, which we refer to as intentions.  Intentions are represented as temporal patterns of care-provider actions or patient states to be maintained, achieved or avoided, using results from our previous work on interpretation and summarization of time-oriented clinical data.  Intentions include both the intermediate and overall process pattern (care provider actions) to follow and the expected intermediate and final outcome pattern (patient states). The tasks that we are focusing on include (1) design-time tasks, such as specification, validation, and verification of the guideline, and (2) runtime tasks such as automated support to application of the guideline, recognition of care providers' intentions from their actions, and real-time as well as retrospective critiquing and quality assessment of care providers' application of he guideline, given the guideline and its intentions, the patient's medical record, and the analysis of the care provider's perceived intentions. In our previous work, we have designed a formal, machine-interpretable language, called Asbru, to represent and to annotate guidelines based on our framework, and implemented a small prototype interpreter for it.  We will implement a full interpreter for the Asbru language and a set of software tools for specification, validation, and verification of Asbru guidelines.  We will also design and implement a set of computational methods for runtime (during application) and retrospective quality assessment of clinical guideline application, both for individual patients and for populations of patients, using our intention-based model. We will rigorously test, validate, and evaluate our methodologies using collaborators in clinical areas such as oncology, hypertension, and endocrinology.    n/a",INTELLIGENT CRITIQUING OF CLINICAL-GUIDELINE APPLICATION,6637556,R01LM006806,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' experimental designs', ' health care quality', ' health services research tag', ' human data', ' medical records', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2003,279167,0.009811285910710038

"Sedation Management in Pediatric Patients DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this two-year project is to pilot test an intervention to change sedation management in pediatric patients supported on mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). While ensuring patient comfort is an integral part of pediatric critical care, analgesic and sedative use in this patient population can be associated with iatrogenic injury; specifically, comfort medications may depress spontaneous ventilation and prolong the duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation. Additionally, drug tolerance develops over time and may precipitate iatrogenic abstinence syndrome when the patient no longer requires sedation. Alternatively, suboptimal comfort management contributes to ventilator dysynchrony and unplanned endotracheal extubation. Our group has developed and validated a nurse-implemented sedation algorithm to guide titration of comfort medications that may optimize patient comfort and reduce the risk of under-medication, but this algorithm needs to be evaluated further. We will pilot test the sedation algorithm in a randomized controlled clinical trial of two matched pediatric intensive care units in two different hospitals. One hospital will be randomized to their usual standard practices for managing sedation, while the other will receive (a) multidisciplinary team education and consensus building, (b) multidisciplinary team identification of the patient's trajectory of illness and daily prescription of a sedation goal, (c) a nurse-implemented sedation algorithm to guide titration of comfort medications, and (d) team feedback on clinical performance.      We hypothesize that pediatric patients managed per sedation protocol will experience fewer days of mechanical ventilation than patients receiving usual care. Secondary outcomes include time to recovery from acute lung injury, duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation, occurrence of adverse events, total exposure to comfort medications, occurrence of iatrogenic opioid and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms, PICU length of stay, barriers to successful implementation of the intervention and PICU costs.    The overall objective of this study is to develop an intervention that can be implemented in any PICU that will provide comfort to intubated and mechanically ventilated infants and children that will not cause them harm. Results of this pilot study will be used to design a future multi-center randomized controlled clinical trial. n/a",Sedation Management in Pediatric Patients,6690641,R21HD045020,"['adult respiratory distress syndrome', ' artificial intelligence', ' benzodiazepines', ' children', ' clinical research', ' clinical trials', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' drug withdrawal', ' health care quality', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' iatrogenic disease', ' intensive care', ' lung injury', ' nurse role', ' nursing education', ' opiate alkaloid', ' outcomes research', ' patient care management', ' patient oriented research', ' pediatrics', ' respirators', ' sensory depression', ' therapy adverse effect']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL BOSTON,R21,2003,194965,0.0005756635181321457

"INTELLIGENT CRITIQUING OF CLINICAL-GUIDELINE APPLICATION Clinical guidelines are a powerful method for standardization and uniform improvement of the quality of medical care.  In the proposed research project, which we call Asgaard/DeGel, we will design and implement software solutions that support the design, application, and, in particular, quality assessment of the application of clinical guidelines by care providers.  Our long-term objectives include provision of a standardized computational framework for specification, application, and runtime as well as retrospective quality assessment of clinical-guidelines. We will provide these solutions by using a novel framework for specification and interpretation of clinical guidelines.  The new framework encodes explicitly both the therapeutic actions indicated by the guideline and the intermediate clinical process and outcome goals of the guideline designers, which we refer to as intentions.  Intentions are represented as temporal patterns of care-provider actions or patient states to be maintained, achieved or avoided, using results from our previous work on interpretation and summarization of time-oriented clinical data.  Intentions include both the intermediate and overall process pattern (care provider actions) to follow and the expected intermediate and final outcome pattern (patient states). The tasks that we are focusing on include (1) design-time tasks, such as specification, validation, and verification of the guideline, and (2) runtime tasks such as automated support to application of the guideline, recognition of care providers' intentions from their actions, and real-time as well as retrospective critiquing and quality assessment of care providers' application of he guideline, given the guideline and its intentions, the patient's medical record, and the analysis of the care provider's perceived intentions. In our previous work, we have designed a formal, machine-interpretable language, called Asbru, to represent and to annotate guidelines based on our framework, and implemented a small prototype interpreter for it.  We will implement a full interpreter for the Asbru language and a set of software tools for specification, validation, and verification of Asbru guidelines.  We will also design and implement a set of computational methods for runtime (during application) and retrospective quality assessment of clinical guideline application, both for individual patients and for populations of patients, using our intention-based model. We will rigorously test, validate, and evaluate our methodologies using collaborators in clinical areas such as oncology, hypertension, and endocrinology.    n/a",INTELLIGENT CRITIQUING OF CLINICAL-GUIDELINE APPLICATION,6530776,R01LM006806,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' experimental designs', ' health care quality', ' health services research tag', ' human data', ' medical records', ' vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2002,322761,0.009811285910710038
"Individualized Expert Systems for Weight Management   DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): The prevalence of overweight and obesity        has increased dramatically over the last two decades. Overweight and obesity,        the second leading preventable cause of death, poses a major public health           challenge in that it increases the risk of chronic diseases, including coronary      heart disease, and all-cause mortality. Clinic-based programs for weight             management are costly and serve only a small percentage of individuals.

"AN EXPERT SYSTEM TO IMPROVE MEDICATION ADHERENCE Despite advances in pharrnacotherapy for hypertension, as many as 75% of hypertensive patients' blood pressure is poorly controlled. Uncontrolled hypertension is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and is largely attributed to failure to adhere with antihypertensive medications. Nonadherence to medication regimens is a long-standing phenomenon that increases health care utilization and costs. Existing research demonstrates that a theoretical framework is needed to advance our ability to design effective interventions. Preliminary research on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to medication adherence suggests that the model has strong explanatory power in this area and has the potential to guide intervention development. Phase l of this Fast-Track proposal involves the development and feasibility test of a stage-matched, individualized, interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively recruiting 70% of eligible participants (n=300) to participate in a randomized trial of an adherence expert system intervention and evaluating acceptability of the intervention materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on adherence, offering far greater availability at a low cost. Applying the TTM to intervention development will provide the theoretical and individualized framework that experts in the area have indicated is necessary. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Up to 75% (37.5 million) of the 50 million Americans afflicted with hypertension fail to adhere to their medication regimen. Nonadherence with antihypertensives, which increases utilization of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency services, contributes a large proportion of drug-related morbidity and mortality the annual costs of which exceed $76 billion.

"DISTRIBUTED OCCUPATIONAL KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM Occupational health receives too little attention in primary care settings; in addition, public health surveillance acquires and utilizes too little of the information available in clinical settings.  Obtaining an appropriate occupational history requires both time and expert knowledge about occupational medicine, both of which are inadequate in most primary care settings.  The DOKS (Distributed Occupational Knowledge System addresses these problems by developing a computer assisted system, which may be directly incorporated in routine primary health care delivery. It obtains a computer assisted occupational history and makes case specific recommendations for preventive interventions.  It will also systematically collect clinical information for public health analysis.  The system will be implemented in three different health ambulatory care settings- county hospital based, health maintenance organization, and clinic group.  Initially, interviews will be in person, then by phone, and later by computer.  Recommendations are provided to patients and clinical care providers.  Evaluation includes historical and concurrent controls and is based on exit and 3 month interviews and record review.  The process also yields valuable surveillance data including population segments often missed by other methods and describing functional impact of work rather than just occupationally caused disease.  n/a",DISTRIBUTED OCCUPATIONAL KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM,6377932,R01CA086470,"['artificial intelligence', ' case history', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder prevention /control', ' human subject', ' information systems', ' occupational disease /disorder', ' patient care management']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2001,187587,0.02631005989470838

Computer based expert systems linked to self-help manuals can be as effective as Counselors but at much lower cost and greater accessibility. Stress is an important cause of cancer and other chronic and acute diseases and is one of the most costly behaviors in terms of health care, job performance and disability. Fifty million Americans do not practice effective stress management. Existing programs are action- oriented and are designed for the 30% of populations who are prepared to take action. Stage matched programs can meet the needs of all; the 45% in the Precontemplation stage and the 25% in the Contemplation stage. Phase I of this Fast-Track research will demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting 70% of at-risk populations and the acceptability of the expert system interventions. Phase II will complete recruitment of 1200 participants randomly assigned to treatment or control and can demonstrate efficacy of these interventions over six months.

"AN EXPERT SYSTEM TO IMPROVE MEDICATION ADHERENCE Despite advances in pharrnacotherapy for hypertension, as many as 75% of hypertensive patients' blood pressure is poorly controlled. Uncontrolled hypertension is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and is largely attributed to failure to adhere with antihypertensive medications. Nonadherence to medication regimens is a long-standing phenomenon that increases health care utilization and costs. Existing research demonstrates that a theoretical framework is needed to advance our ability to design effective interventions. Preliminary research on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to medication adherence suggests that the model has strong explanatory power in this area and has the potential to guide intervention development. Phase l of this Fast-Track proposal involves the development and feasibility test of a stage-matched, individualized, interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively recruiting 70% of eligible participants (n=300) to participate in a randomized trial of an adherence expert system intervention and evaluating acceptability of the intervention materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on adherence, offering far greater availability at a low cost. Applying the TTM to intervention development will provide the theoretical and individualized framework that experts in the area have indicated is necessary. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Up to 75% (37.5 million) of the 50 million Americans afflicted with hypertension fail to adhere to their medication regimen. Nonadherence with antihypertensives, which increases utilization of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency services, contributes a large proportion of drug-related morbidity and mortality the annual costs of which exceed $76 billion. Effective and cost-effective population-based adherence expert systems can reduce morbidity, mortality, health care utilization, and related costs, resulting in tremendous commercial potential.  n/a",AN EXPERT SYSTEM TO IMPROVE MEDICATION ADHERENCE,6345563,R44HL063481,"['antihypertensive agents', ' artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' health care service utilization', ' human subject', ' hypertension', ' interactive multimedia', ' patient monitoring device', ' questionnaires', ' therapy compliance']",NHLBI,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2000,455669,0.02561482210539231
"STRESS MANAGEMENT EXPERT SYSTEM FOR CANCER PREVENTION DESCRIPTION:  Stage matched interventions for stress management that are interactive and individualized, and are delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts.  Computer based expert systems linked to self-help manuals can be as effective as counselors but at much lower cost and greater accessibility.  Stress is an important cause of cancer and other chronic and acute diseases and is one of the most costly behaviors in terms of health care, job performance and disability.  Fifty million Americans do not practice effective stress management.  Existing programs are action-oriented and are designed for the 30% of populations who are prepared to take action.  Stage matched programs can meet the needs of all; the 45% in the Pre-contemplation stage and the 25% in the Contemplation stage.  Phase I of this Fast-Track research will demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting 70% of at-risk populations and the acceptability of the expert system interventions.  Phase II will complete recruitment of 1200 participants randomly assigned to treatment or control and can demonstrate efficacy of these interventions over six months.  Follow-up over 18 months can show increasing impact long after the intervention.  Effective and cost-effective stress management systems can be broadly disseminated with consistent quality and user friendly acceptability.  n/a",STRESS MANAGEMENT EXPERT SYSTEM FOR CANCER PREVENTION,6211051,R44CA081948,"['artificial intelligence', ' cancer prevention', ' clinical research', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' education evaluation /planning', ' health education', ' human subject', ' interactive multimedia', ' publications', ' questionnaires', ' self help', ' statistics /biometry', ' stress management']",NCI,"PRO-CHANGE BEHAVIOR SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2000,371291,0.01344040179008271
"DISTRIBUTED OCCUPATIONAL KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM Occupational health receives too little attention in primary care settings; in addition, public health surveillance acquires and utilizes too little of the information available in clinical settings.  Obtaining an appropriate occupational history requires both time and expert knowledge about occupational medicine, both of which are inadequate in most primary care settings.  The DOKS (Distributed Occupational Knowledge System addresses these problems by developing a computer assisted system, which may be directly incorporated in routine primary health care delivery. It obtains a computer assisted occupational history and makes case specific recommendations for preventive interventions.  It will also systematically collect clinical information for public health analysis.  The system will be implemented in three different health ambulatory care settings- county hospital based, health maintenance organization, and clinic group.  Initially, interviews will be in person, then by phone, and later by computer.  Recommendations are provided to patients and clinical care providers.  Evaluation includes historical and concurrent controls and is based on exit and 3 month interviews and record review.  The process also yields valuable surveillance data including population segments often missed by other methods and describing functional impact of work rather than just occupationally caused disease.  n/a",DISTRIBUTED OCCUPATIONAL KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM,6174427,R01CA086470,"['artificial intelligence', ' case history', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder prevention /control', ' human subject', ' information systems', ' occupational disease /disorder', ' patient care management']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2000,187587,0.02631005989470838
"COMPUTER ASSISTED SMOKING CESSATION COUNSELING Encouraging physicians to counsel their smoking patients to quit is a national health priority. Physicians note several barriers to counseling smokers, including a lack of time, expertise, and organizational support. Using computers for collecting data to assist physicians in counseling patients is a way of improving the utilization of current computer technologies and behavioral models. Despite the efficacy of computer systems that enhance prevention, many barriers remain to the incorporation of such programs outside of research settings. Such a health communications system can assist a busy physician as it can query smokers about their habit, organize and present the information to provide ""best practice"" guidance for intervention and follow-up. The specific aim of this study is to determine, through systematic formative research, how to best integrate an innovative computer ""expert system"" into everyday used in primary care offices. In this formative (NCI-phase II) pilot study we propose to carry out focus group discussions with all parties directly involved in primary care practices (patients, physicians, staff) to understand how best to integrate the system into everyday practice. We will integrate the computer expert system in the practices of five primary care physicians. Our primary hypothesis is that the system will be able to be integrated into primary care practice and be used by more than 50% of smokers before their physician visit. Our secondary hypothesis is that the computer system will increase the number of smoking cessation counseling activities undertaken by physicians (e.g., set a quit date), measured by patient exit interviews. Armed with the data from the pilot study, our future aim will be to: a) further refine the computer expert system into an optimal package for integration into practice and b) to conduct a randomized clinical trial (NCI phase III) of the system in a more representative sample of physicians with sufficient power to evaluate the initial efficacy of the intervention using verified 7 day point prevalence and continuous abstinence as the primary outcomes.  n/a",COMPUTER ASSISTED SMOKING CESSATION COUNSELING,6175236,R03CA083346,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer human interaction', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' patient care management', ' primary care physician', ' smoking cessation', ' technology /technique development']",NCI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R03,2000,76181,0.001151645776114173
"WEIGHT MANAGEMENT EXPERT SYSTEMS FOR DIABETES Approximately 90% of individuals with NIDDM are overweight. Overweight can exacerbate the course of the disease and co-morbid conditions, increasing health care utilization, morbidity, and mortality. Clinic-based programs for weight management are costly and serve only a small percentage of at risk individuals. Thus, population-based behavior change programs may be necessary to reach larger percentages of at risk individuals more cost- effectively. Preliminary research on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to health behaviors involved in weight management suggests that the model has the potential to guide the development of effective multiple-behavior interventions. Phase I of this Fast-Track proposal involves the customization and feasibility test of a stage-matched, individualized, interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively recruiting 50% of eligible participants (n=300) to participate in a randomized clinical trial of a comprehensive weight management expert system intervention and evaluating acceptability of the intervention materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on the targeted health behaviors as well as weight. Using the TTM as the basis will provide the theoretical and individualized framework that experts in the area have indicated is necessary to develop more effective and cost- effective interventions. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Overweight and obesity are costly to all participants in the health care delivery system. Over 90% of the 15 million adults with NIDDM are overweight, which increases healthcare utilization, morbidity, and mortality.

The research aims of this              randomized clinical trial involving over 800 at-risk Washington, D.C.-area       families of 7 to 11 year olds in components of the 16 week Strengthening         Families Program (SFP) are:  1) to test the differential efficacy of the         three major components of SFP-parent training (PT), children's skills            training (CT), and family skills training (FT) compared to a minimal contact     control (MT) on precursors and substance use/abuse employing a 2 x 4             experimental design; 2) to estimate the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness      of the SFP components with 400 African American families and 400 White           families; and 3) to empirically test several competing etiological and           intervention theories of drug use/abuse underlying the intervention design       by analyzing the survey research data from 1,600 12 to 19 year olds and the      800 intervention families using structural equation modeling, mediational        analysis, hierarchical linear modeling, latent growth modeling, and              transactional modeling (cross-lagged SEM, artificial intelligence, and           neural network simulations) for gender, race, and other sub-groups.  The         rationale for the component design is that a major question exists               concerning the efficacy of child-only interventions that group high-risk         children together as well as the added benefit of working with the family        together compared to parent-training only.  Demonstrating the importance of      involving parents and working with families would be very valuable               information for prevention providers.  Additional co-variate outcome             analyses will be conducted to answer practical questions conceming the           efficacy of the four interventions for different subgroups of clients.

"Addressing variability in peripheral arterial disease outcomes using machine learning techniques Project Summary/Abstract: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, affecting over eight million Americans, of whom 100,000 a year suffer major amputation. Current guidelines dictate medical treatment and aggressive risk factor modification for all PAD patients, whether symptomatic or not, with revascularization attempts for patients with chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) or lifestyle-limiting claudication. Despite strongly-worded standards of care, variability in PAD outcomes persists. Prior research has demonstrated that some demographic factors such as gender, race, and socioeconomic status are associated with worse PAD care and outcomes even when controlling for comorbidities. It is unknown what specific patient, provider, and healthcare system factors lead to these disparities. Efforts to understand which patients will suffer worse outcomes and disease progression have been hampered by contemporary outcomes research techniques. The majority of PAD outcomes research relies on administrative claims databases, procedural registries, or single center retrospective reviews. While each of these methods has some advantages, none offer the combination of patient- and disease-specific data, information about care provision on a provider and health-system level, and outcomes across a range of possible locations. Furthermore, use of any of these methods at the scale necessary to draw powerful conclusions is prohibitively time- and resource-intensive. The overall objective of this research is to use a novel natural language processing model to build a combined EHR/CMS database and to use that database to predict which PAD patients are at highest risk of poor outcomes with improved power and precision. This proposal contains plans for collaboration with Duke Forge, who bring expertise in natural language processing and machine learning in order to efficiently identify PAD patients within our EHR and efficiently abstract information about them. Once identified, these patients can be linked to their CMS outcomes, allowing for assessment of how patient-, physician-, and healthcare-specific factors affect PAD outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that natural language processing powered by machine learning will permit efficient identification of patients with PAD, thereby facilitating higher-powered and higher-quality investigation into disparities in PAD outcomes. This research will pave the way for future interventions targeting sources of outcome inequality, possibly including access to care, physician adherence to national guidelines, and patient preferences or health literacy. Project Narrative: Peripheral arterial disease affects more than eight million Americans, with over one hundred thousand amputations performed yearly. Despite the prevalence and morbidity of this disease, there is a lack of knowledge about which patients will require amputation, multiple surgeries or hospitalizations, or suffer cardiovascular- related death. This proposal uses natural language processing to improve on current research methodology in order to account for patient-specific, physician-specific, and system-specific factors in peripheral arterial disease care and outcomes.",Addressing variability in peripheral arterial disease outcomes using machine learning techniques,10066805,F32HL151181,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demographic Factors', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Inequality', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Technics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'claudication', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,82476,-0.005408825926695283

"Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only one in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest costs are hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with daily life activities. A fall safety system shows the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs, reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, no fall detection and prevention technology has been developed specifically for the needs of dementia care where individuals (1) fall more frequently and (2) often cannot tell care staff how they fell, leading to increased use of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) when falls are unwitnessed to ensure affected individuals are safe. Our goal is to perform a randomized wait-list control clinical trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for residents with AD and related dementias (ADRD). The automation is based on algorithms that push the frontier of deep learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a human-in-the- loop (HIL). SafelyYou Guardian is designed to primarily operate in memory care facilities (defined herein as assisted living and skilled nursing facilities providing ADRD care). Deep learning has already revolutionized several fields: robotics, self-driving cars, social networks in particular. Our approach is anchored in novel algorithms developed at the Berkeley AI Research Lab (BAIR) and extended by SafelyYou for real-time detection of rare events in video. The HIL is operating from a call center, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the communities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection. Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) working from our office in San Francisco reviews the fall videos with the front-line staff over video conference and using our web portal to make recommendations on how to re-organize the resident space (intervention) to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning approach identifies and pre-filters falls with high sensitivity followed by a human who confirms the fall with high specificity and calls the communities in case of detected fall. This project leverages past small scale clinical and technical pilots including 87 residents from 11 partner communities, and our experience with paid commitments for 480 residents from three partner networks. Past pilots leading to this NIH Phase II proposal include:  · Pilot 1: Technical proof of concept with healthy subjects (200 acted falls).  · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by residents, family and  staff, through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, our first  partner facility; we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led to clinical benefits  including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of OT. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11  communities, for 87 residents monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4: Small scale NIH Phase I clinical trial. We demonstrated the ability to perform real-time fall detection, with real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions which provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities. We demonstrated that 93% of 89 falls were detected, that time on the ground was reduced by 42%, that the likelihood of EMS use was 50% lower with video available, and the that total facility falls including participants and non-participants decreased by 38%. The trial proposed for this NIH SBIR Phase II will provide clinical evidence that the preliminary trends observed experimentally (pilot 2) and at small scale (pilot 4) are true phenomena. It will use a wait-list control population (230 residents) to be compared to the population monitored with SafelyYou Guardian (230 residents). After crossover, the wait-list population will also benefit from the technology and be compared to itself before crossover. Narrative The goal of this project is to perform a randomized, wait-list controlled trial (n=460) of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection and prevention system for memory care facilities (defined here as skilled nursing and assisted living facilities providing dementia care). The technology applies breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to video data collected from off- the-shelf, wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls from video for residents with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); it enables care staff (1) to know about falls right away without requiring residents wear a device, (2) to use video review to quickly assess need for emergency medical services (EMS) after unwitnessed falls, and (3) to perform accurate incident review with support from a remote occupational therapist (OT) to assess how to reduce the risk of repeat falls. The Phase I project goal of launching this service at small scale was achieved and demonstrated with 11 memory care facilities (1) 93% of 89 falls detected, generating 1 alarm per camera per 15 days, (2) 37% reduction in EMS use through better understanding of risk when residents with dementia were found on the floor, and (3) 38% reduction in falls through reduced risk of repeat falls following OT video review.",Fall Detection and Prevention for Memory Care through Real-Time Artificial Intelligence Applied to Video,10020322,R44AG058354,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Family', 'Floor', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health care facility', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Notification', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'San Francisco', 'Series', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'care costs', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'dementia care', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'frontier', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'memory care', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'trend', 'web portal']",NIA,"SAFELYYOU, INC.",R44,2020,493633,0.006960622221266162
"Improving Telerehabilitation in Pediatric Cerebral Palsy Using Machine Learning and Social Robots PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disorder in young children. There is no cure, but disciplined rehabilitation can improve outcomes. A critical component of rehabilitation is continuous assessment of patient function. Patients in rural areas can have difﬁculty accessing care. Telerehabilitation provides an option to extend access to care, but has limitations. The foci of this project are 1) understanding how a social robot physically co-located with the patient during a telerehabilitation assessment alters the activity by the patient, potentially leading to changes in the ability of the clinician to perform assessment and 2) whether computer vision and machine learning can be used to assess patients. Together, these two complementary goals will show a path forward for remote treatment of patients with CP and similar conditions.  The effect of using a social robot in telerehabilitation will be examined through a study where pediatric CP subjects and typical subjects interact with a remote operator in three conditions: face-to-face, over traditional telepresence, and over telepresence with a social robot present. Direct changes in the level of subject interaction and compliance will be measured through surveys and video coding. The effect on quality of assessment will be measured by presenting expert therapists with ﬁrst-person video recordings from each condition and comparing the variance of their grading for each condition.  To truly realize the promise of using remote assessment to extend care, automated grading of assessments is necessary. To evaluate the feasibility of this, videos of children with various levels of upper extremity function along with their box and block scores and clinician ratings will be used to train two algorithms. Both algorithms will begin by using off the shelf convolutional neural network based tools to extract the pose of the subjects. The ﬁrst algorithm will be hand designed. It will learn how to weight known metrics of motion, such as movement speed, time to maximum speed, and number of speed peaks, using principal component analysis and a naive Gaussian classiﬁer. The second algorithm will use a custom neural network operating directly on the time-series pose data. Both algorithms will attempt to, given video of a novel subject, predict the level of function as would be predicted by a therapist. Both algorithms will be analyzed to discover their underlying decision-making philosophies, which may give insight into what parameters of motion clearly differentiate levels of function.  The project will be done in the context of a pre-doctoral training plan. The plan focuses on developing an independent researcher at the intersection of robotics and rehabilitation science. This will be done within Mechanical Engineering, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing, and Perception (GRASP) laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania with additional mentorship and experience at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. PROJECT NARRATIVE Limits to care for pediatric cerebral palsy patients in rural areas could be addressed through telepresence, but current technologies fail to adequately convey information. This project will explore whether combining social robots with telepresence systems and computer vision can improve the quality of telerehabilitation for the purpose of remote assessment. The social robot will aid communication to the patient, motivating them through activities, while the computer vision automatically assesses function.",Improving Telerehabilitation in Pediatric Cerebral Palsy Using Machine Learning and Social Robots,9991534,F31HD102165,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asses', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Automation', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Background', 'Engineering', 'Exercise', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Improve Access', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Network-based', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Philadelphia', 'Philosophy', 'Physical Medicine', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Upper Extremity', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'communication aid', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'experience', 'human-robot interaction', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'motor disorder', 'neural network', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'peer', 'pre-doctoral', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation science', 'robot rehabilitation', 'robotic system', 'rural area', 'social assistive robot', 'telerehabilitation', 'tool', 'vocalization']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,-0.02000779716978439
"Outpatient Worsening Heart Failure in an Integrated Health Care Delivery System: An Innovative Approach to Characterizing a Novel Clinical Entity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although the management of ambulatory heart failure (HF) has been revolutionized by evidence-based drug and device therapies, there has been no such parallel progress in the care of patients admitted for worsening HF (WHF). To incentivize health systems to reduce 30-day readmissions, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) launched the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) in 2012, which penalizes hospitals financially if they have higher than expected risk-adjusted 30-day readmission rates for conditions including HF. Although the HRRP has modestly reduced readmissions, this program has had the unintended consequence of shifting a significant fraction of HF-related care to the outpatient setting. Thus, there is a growing interest in the field to disentangle WHF from location of care and move away from using hospitalization as a surrogate for acute decompensated HF. However, little is known about the epidemiology, clinical profile, treatment patterns, and/or outcomes of outpatient WHF. In addition, while the overall survival of ambulatory HF patients has improved dramatically, guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) has had minimal impact on impairments in health- related quality of life (HRQOL). Despite this reality, there are few real-world data sources available to describe the trajectory of HRQOL in the ambulatory setting. To address these critical knowledge gaps, we propose (1) to systematically describe the contemporary epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes associated with outpatient WHF and (2) to evaluate the impact of an episode of outpatient WHF on generic and disease-specific HRQOL in the context of a fully integrated health care delivery system. The first objective will leverage observational data from a large, state-of-the-art, and validated electronic health record (EHR) system and machine learning algorithms for natural language processing (NLP) to systematically ascertain and comprehensively characterize episodes of outpatient WHF. The second objective will prospectively apply this software-based solution to evaluate generic and disease-specific HRQOL among patients with a recent clinical encounter for outpatient WHF. The overarching goal of this career development award is to provide me with the requisite training in research methodology and project experience to build upon my past successes as a traditional clinical trialist in order to also becoming a leader in health services, implementation science, and pragmatic clinical trials within a learning health system. Strengths of my proposal include my prior relevant training and track record in research, the experience and commitment of my mentors, collaborators, and consultants, and the vast institutional resources and support. In summary, this research proposal will employ innovative analytic approaches to elucidate the epidemiology, clinical features, and outcomes of this previously underappreciated and novel clinical entity. Given the current trend towards managing acute cardiac conditions primarily in the ambulatory setting, these findings have immediate implications for formulating public health policy as well as the design and conduct of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE While the Affordable Care Act-mandated Hospital Readmission Reduction Program launched in 2012 has modestly reduced readmissions, an unintended consequence has been the shift of a significant fraction of heart failure (HF)-related care to the outpatient setting.

"Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people and 11% of older adults in the United States. Studies on patient transitions across healthcare settings suggests that older adults with chronic conditions are vulnerable to inadequate transfer of information, putting them at risk for diminished quality of care, medication errors and potentially preventable complications. Patients at varied stages along the ADRD trajectory – especially those with multiple chronic conditions – may experience unique risks due to the loss of information across care settings. In a recent study, we developed a longitudinal dataset on a diverse cohort of 56,652 patients – mostly aged 65+ with multiple comorbidities – receiving home health care (HHC) services from a large non-profit home care provider. For patients admitted to HHC in 2010-2012, we identified subgroups of patients with ADRD diagnoses made prior to and after HHC admission. Outside the scope of this prior study remains a vast and largely unexplored data source – nurses’ free-text clinical notes captured in the electronic health record. With roughly 1 million entries of nurses’ free- text notes associated with the study population, there is a wealth of potential information from which to gain new insights and a need for innovative methods to analyze this unstructured data source. In this study, we propose to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques, a method for systematically analyzing free-text content that draws upon machine learning. Using the dataset developed in the prior study, this study aims to: 1. Expand and improve an existing NLP system to automatically identify the following information in the  nursing free-text notes: (i) knowledge of the patient having a previously established ADRD diagnosis; (ii)  observations of cognitive symptoms and related patient/caregiver needs; and (iii) mentions of interventions  to address these needs. 2. For patients who do not have an ADRD diagnosis prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-  text documentation of cognitive symptoms identified in the NLP predict subsequent ADRD diagnoses  during the 4-year follow-up period. 3. Among patients diagnosed with ADRD prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-text  documentation patterns (e.g. knowledge of the patient’s ADRD diagnostic status, observations of cognitive  symptoms, and interventions) predict: (i) service use; and (ii) adverse health outcomes for which ADRD  patients are at heightened risk (e.g. hospitalizations due to urinary tract infection, dehydration, falls). This study will allow us to examine HHC nurses’ practices, which are often difficult to observe systematically, and identify strategies to address the complex needs of their patients with ADRD and un-diagnosed patients who may be on a path toward ADRD diagnosis. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a home- based intervention that aims to improve quality of life for patients and caregivers along the ADRD trajectory. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect about 5 million people in the U.S. Home health care nurses provide care for many people with ADRD and document what they observe about their patients’ needs in the form of free-text notes. This study will use a method known as ‘natural language processing’ to gain new knowledge from nurses’ notes and identify ways to better support people with ADRD and their caregivers.","Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study",10056750,R21AG065753,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Assessment tool', 'Awareness', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Nursing', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dehydration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home Care Services', 'Home Health Care Agencies', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Medicare claim', 'Medication Errors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'New York', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Nursing Services', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Management', 'Services', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Visiting Nurse', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'health care settings', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'patient home care', 'patient subsets', 'racial and ethnic', 'study population', 'unstructured data']",NIA,VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF NEW YORK,R21,2020,260660,-0.01678694668306302
"Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this study is to examine how access to dental care among low-income adults is impacted by state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, dental coverage, cost-sharing and dentist reimbursement. Oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity and well-being. Yet access to dental care continues to be a major public health problem for low-income adults, leading to untreated disease, pain, poor systemic health and substantial economic burden. In recent years, several policy changes under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as Medicaid expansion and dependent care coverage could significantly impact access to dental care among the poor non-elderly adults. In addition, there is extensive cross-state variation in terms of dental benefits covered for Medicaid adults. These variations provide natural experiments to examine the effect of Medicaid policies on access to dental care. Moreover, under the current health reform discussions, state Medicaid programs are anticipated to gain autonomy in resource allocation, yet may receive significantly less federal funding, making the need for robust evidence on relative effectiveness of Medicaid policy alternatives available to the states paramount. The overarching goal of this application is to advance the research career of the candidate (Dr. Singhal) by protecting her time for training and research on these critical issues in oral health policy. This goal will be accomplished through additional training in complementary disciplines of econometrics and machine learning, and their application to estimate the impacts of Medicaid coverage and payment generosities on access to dental care. The project brings together complementary secondary data from multiple sources including: large national survey data (National Health Interview Survey), administrative enrollment and claims data (Medicaid Analytic eXtract) and linked survey and claims data. Leveraging these data and training resources, this project will: 1) develop synthetic indices of Medicaid dental coverage and payment generosities; 2) estimate the effect of each policy alternative and combined generosity indices on various measures of access to dental care; and 3) predict the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives and their combinations on access to dental care. We will use econometric methods including instrumental variables, difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity models to develop the generosity indices and to estimate the impact of Medicaid generosity. To develop and validate the predictive model, we will use supervised machine learning approaches (e.g. decision tree learning) using linked survey and claims data. The results will provide evidence needed to inform future strategies to ensure efficient use of health care resources to reduce oral health disparities. The completion of this project will also enable Dr. Singhal to establish a research program as an independent research investigator with support from her multi-disciplinary mentoring and advising teams and the vibrant research community at Boston University. PROJECT NARRATIVE Access to dental care is a major public health problem among low-income adults, as evidenced by declining rates of dental care utilization, high unmet dental need, and the increasing rate of emergency department visits for dental problems by this vulnerable population. The research plan of this career development award aims to: 1) examine how state Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, coverage and dentist reimbursement impact access to dental care among low-income adults, and 2) develop a model to predict the impact of hypothetical policy changes. A clearer understanding of the relative effectiveness of policy alternatives available to states is critical to ensuring the efficient use of healthcare resources and achieving NIDCR’s strategic goal to reduce income-based disparities in access to and outcomes of oral health care services.",Role of State Medicaid Policies in Improving Access to Dental Care among Low-Income Adults,9949693,K08DE027720,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cost Control', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Health Services', 'Dentists', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Natural experiment', 'Oral health', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'decision tree learning', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'econometrics', 'evidence base', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data sources', 'payment', 'population health', 'population survey', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'relative effectiveness', 'supervised learning']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K08,2020,131517,0.026771433180609715
"TOPIC 409 PHASE I FY20 SBIR CONTRACT - TOPIC 409 - INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION INC. Cancer patients experience substantial functional impairments during and after treatments, often requiring rehabilitation and exercise interventions. However, a functional assessment of the specific deficits and impairments in the individual is needed to inform exercise therapy. The oncology workforce is challenged in its capacity to conduct such functional assessment, therefore limiting the ability of rehabilitation providers to identify and meet the needs of these individuals. This work seeks to develop a novel, low-cost PC/camera-based image/video-monitoring system that can a) continuously and unobtrusively monitor the physical health of a cancer patient in his/her natural environment, b) determine the existence and extent of functional deficits, and c) facilitate personalized rehabilitative interventions, providing a risk-stratified and personalized approach to cancer patient care. Based on patient’s daily activities or exercises, objective and quantitative clinically-relevant and laboratory-validated measures of physical performance (e.g., gait speed, balance, and fall risk) will be extracted by using state-of-the-art image-processing and machine-learning techniques, involving human-detection, pose-estimation, and deep-learning algorithms and fall-risk prediction models. By providing the patients and their clinicians with a real-time assessment of their physical performance, through a PCbased software and a Web portal, respectively, the system will facilitate proactive rehabilitation via clinician-approved, personalized health-care tips and exercise recommendations. n/a",TOPIC 409 PHASE I FY20 SBIR CONTRACT - TOPIC 409 - INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION INC.,10267589,5N91020C00042,"['Aftercare', 'Automation', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinic', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Detection', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Feedback', 'Gait speed', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Oncology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Physical assessment', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'exercise intervention', 'exercise rehabilitation', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'functional disability', 'image processing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized health care', 'physical conditioning', 'prototype', 'risk prediction model', 'software systems', 'web portal']",NCI,"INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION, INC.",N43,2020,399961,-0.024594633150085803
"ClientBot: A conversational agent that supports skills practice and feedback for Motivational Interviewing for AUD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Millions of Americans are in need of evidence-based counseling, such as motivational interviewing (MI), for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) each year. To develop competence in an evidence-based practice like MI, trainees require ample opportunities for practice and immediate, performance-based feedback on the skills that they are learning. However, this is challenging if not impossible to offer at scale -- to the large number of providers in need of training. Opportunities for practice typically rely on roleplays with other trainees with limited experience, and feedback requires either direct supervision from an expert trainer or behavioral coding from a trained coding team; these are costly, limited, and time consuming. AI-based technology can meet this need, generating many opportunities for practice, and providing regular, actionable feedback. Many practice opportunities coupled with rapid, performance-based feedback can enhance and expand training in evidence-based counseling for AUDs in a scalable and cost-efficient manner.  Lyssn.io​, Inc., (“Lyssn”) is a start-up developing AI-based technologies to support training, supervision, and quality assurance of evidence-based counseling. Our goal is to develop innovative health technology solutions that are objective, scalable, and cost efficient. ​Lyssn’s​ team includes expertise in natural language processing, machine learning, user-centered design, software engineering, and clinical expertise in evidence-based counseling. Previous research demonstrated the basic utility of a prototype conversational agent (ClientBot) for training counselors. Currently, ClientBot simulates a general mental health client who can engage in open-ended interaction with trainees and provides immediate, performance-based feedback to trainees using machine learning.  The current Fast-Track SBIR proposal partners ​Lyssn​ with Prevention Research Institute (PRI), who has a long track-record of training counselors in evidence-based approaches for AUD and currently trains approximately 1,250 counselors per year. Phase I will adapt ClientBot to an AUD training context, including understanding PRI training workflows, assessing usability, and accuracy of machine learning based MI feedback. Phase II will conduct a field-based usability trial and a randomized training trial (N = 200 PRI trainees) to evaluate the effectiveness of ClientBot on learning of MI skills compared to a wait-list and PRI training-as-usual. Analyses will also examine the hypothesized mechanisms of behavior change underlying ClientBot’s MI skills training. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on role plays with peers and human judgment for training and performance-based feedback and support commercialization of a ClientBot product for training of AUD counselors in evidence-based practices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Training counselors in evidence-based treatments for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) requires repeated opportunities for skills practice with performance-based feedback, which is challenging to provide at scale.

"A Comprehensive Fall Prevention System for Memory Care: Final Feasibility and Randomized Controlled Study Abstract In the US, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the single most expensive disease, the only disease in the top six for which the number of deaths is increasing. The greatest cost contributors are frequent hospitalizations, where falls are the largest culprit, and frequent need for assistance with the activities of daily living. Fall safety systems show the potential to reduce costs and increase quality of care by reducing the likelihood of emergency events (e.g., detecting falls before a fracture occurs and reducing the number of repeat falls). Unfortunately, current safety devices require wearable or sensor technology not suitable for individuals with dementia and incapable of showing caregivers how falls occur. Our goal is to extend the impacts of SafelyYou Guardian, an online fall detection system with off-the- shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a human-in-the-loop (HIL). The HIL, who can monitor several facilities at a time, confirms the fall detection alerts provided by our artificial intelligence algorithms, and places a call to the facilities, so an intervention can happen within minutes of the fall detection (as opposed to hours after, when the next scheduled visit to the room of the patient happens). Subsequently, an Occupational Therapist (OT) reviews the fall videos to make recommendations on how to re-organize the patient space (intervention), to prevent future falls. We leverage our HIL paradigm, in which our deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) approaches identify and pre-filter falls well enough to leave the last check to a human, who will call the facilities in case of detected safety critical events (falls). The present Fast Track NIH SBIR project leverages the already recruited 100 patients in our partner 11 memory care facilities, recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots, which we leverage:  · Pilot 1: We demonstrated the feasibility of the system by collecting proof-of-concept data  containing 200 acted falls of healthy subjects and showed accurate fall detection. · Pilot 2: We demonstrated acceptance of privacy/safety tradeoffs by patients, family and staff,  through the collection of 3 months of video data at WindChime of Marin, a memory care facility  from the Integral Senior Living network, in which we identified 4 total hours of fall data. This led  to clinical benefits including an 80% fall reduction through the intervention of an Occupational  Therapist (OT) to re-organize patient space. · Pilot 3: We demonstrated scalability and acceptance by deploying the system in 11 facilities,  totaling 100 patients monitored by our system (offline, no HIL intervention). · Pilot 4 (ongoing): We demonstrated the ability to perform online (real-time) fall detection, with  real-time intervention of the HIL through our partner company Magellan-Solutions, which  provides the 24/7 monitoring service for the facilities, and confirmed the decrease of the  number of falls, with the 100 patients. In this project, we will develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. We operate in memory care facilities (which for the purpose of our work includes skilled nursing and assisted living). In Phase I, we seek to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to-stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real- time fall detection on blurred video. We hypothesize that sit-to-stand detection will remove the need for bed alarms; passive gait monitoring will allow identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, we seek to examine clinical outcomes using a waitlist randomized control study design with sample size of 280 participants. We hypothesize that when compared to standard-of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective. Narrative The goal of this Fast-Track SBIR project is to extend the impact of SafelyYou Guardian, a real- time fall detection system using off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to develop a comprehensive fall detection and prevention system for memory care called SafelyYou Comprehensive Care. SafelyYou Guardian is an online fall detection system with off-the-shelf wall-mounted cameras to automatically detect falls for patients with AD and related dementias (ADRD), enabled by a Human-in-the-Loop (HIL). In Phase I, this Fast Track SBIR project will perform a first trial to establish the technical feasibility and preliminary clinical benefit of sit-to- stand detection, passive gait monitoring, and real-time fall detection on blurred video. We want to demonstrate that sit-to-stand detection can remove the need for bed alarms; that passive gait monitoring will enable identification of high-risk individuals, allowing interventions to be proactively applied; and that applying all techniques on blurred video will increase opt-in rate for those with privacy concerns (today 25% opt-in leading to existing facility-wide outcomes). In Phase II, through a 280-patient trial, we will examine clinical outcomes of the system using a waitlist randomized control study. We want to demonstrate that when compared to standard- of-care (waitlist control group), SafelyYou Comprehensive Care will reduce fall rates, reduce number of severe falls that require ER care and hospitalizations, and be more cost effective. The project leverages a 100-patient population in our 11 partner facilities (assisted living and skill nursing), recruited through our previous IRB-approved pilots.

"ACILIA will be a low-cost kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities to provide educational information and emotional coping support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Currently, 5.7 million people live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) in the United States, and this number is projected to reach 13.8 million by 2050. Two-thirds of individuals with ADRD live at home and as a result, approximately 15 million unpaid care partners, mostly family members, are increasingly required to perform complex tasks which causes them significant stress. The major contributors to care partners’ stress are: 1) having low confidence in their competency in their caregiving tasks, such as managing activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and behavioral symptoms of ADRD as they change over the course of the disease and 2) being socially isolated with feelings of loneliness. Benten proposes to address these problems through creation of the Avatar Companion to Improve the Lives of Informal care partners of individuals with Alzheimer’s (ACILIA), a home kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities (i.e., emotion analysis, sentiment analysis and life-long machine learning [L3] algorithm), with home speakers, a smart watch, and mobile app, to support the CPs on the care journey. ACILIA will provide just-in--time guidance and support to care partners in addition to stage- appropriate education and training on how to manage caregiving tasks. It will also engage in natural conversations with the care partners detecting sentiments of stress and offering advice and support and connection to a virtual community. ACILIA aims to assist in reducing the family care partners’ stress levels by improving their competency and capabilities in providing care and by providing companionship and support, which will reflect positively on their quality of life and that of their loved ones living with ADRD and aging in place. During this Phase I project, we will develop of a prototype ACILIA using input from an advisory board of informal care partners and people living with ADRD. We will also conduct a pilot test for feasibility of ACILIA among 20 individuals who are in early-middle stage ADRD and their informal care partners to evaluate the usability and acceptance of ACILIA prototype. Successful completion of Phase I will lead to Phase II and evaluating its outcomes. improving informal care partners’ competency, reducing their feeling of loneliness, and reducing their stress levels in an adequately powered randomized controlled trial (RCT). PROJECT NARRATIVE User-centered design and pilot testing conducted for the Phase 1 development of ACILIA will make it possible to evaluate the feasibility of ACILIA to support informal care partners of PLWAD in their care efforts. In the long-term, Benten envisions ACILIA becoming a valuable tool for informal care partners, enabling them to perform their caregiving tasks more effectively by delivering just-in-time stage-appropriate training and stress- reduction support, and offering companionship throughout the journey of providing dementia care.",ACILIA will be a low-cost kit with SaaS platform that integrates an embodied conversational agent using AI capabilities to provide educational information and emotional coping support,10083570,R43AG069659,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Anger', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feeling', 'Frustration', 'Home environment', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Role', 'Services', 'Social isolation', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'United States', 'Universities', 'aging in place', 'base', 'care burden', 'caregiving', 'coping', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'informal care', 'informal support', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'loved ones', 'member', 'mindfulness-based stress reduction', 'mobile application', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'online community', 'prototype', 'smart watch', 'social', 'stress reduction', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIA,"BENTEN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2020,549149,0.03233066833305545
"SUDCare: A smart mobile tool to support substance use screening and follow-up care PROJECT SUMMARY Substance use disorder (SUD) is a significant public health challenge that costs the US over $740 billion annually and lacks the current workforce to address it. Our proposed innovation, SUDCare, is a novel and intelligent mobile application that will be designed to address the pressing needs of primary care patients who have inadequate resources and services for SUD screening and follow-up care. The core components of the proposed innovation will consist of a remote screening tool for the assessment of patients’ risk level of SUD and a chatbot to support logistical and routine queries. Our research team will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to create a scalable and sustainable solution to support an evidence-based SUD screening and treatment protocol. SUDCare has the potential to streamline follow-up clinic encounters and minimize the increasing workload burden placed on PCPs while filling a largely unfilled gap in care for hard-to- reach populations not directly served by any SUD therapeutic solutions available today. The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to test technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of SUDCare. We will accomplish this goal using a user-centered design framework following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will conduct semi- structured formative interviews with stakeholders (i.e., primary care providers, nurses, care coordinators, insurers, health IT specialists) and potential target end users (i.e., patients) (Substudy 1, N=20) recruited from our partnering primary care clinic. The data collected from this Substudy will be used to support the SUDCare development and requirements for integration with clinic workflow and systems. In Aim 2, we will build a working prototype of SUDCare. To create the chatbot prototype, we will train an English language model using a rich, existing de-identified dataset of text-message conversations from previous related work. Finally, in Aim 3, we will assess the acceptability of SUDCare through usability testing conducted with patients at risk of SUD (Substudy 2, N=8). Results from Phase I will inform a potential Phase II project to further develop SUDCare and conduct a larger-scaled pilot study to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of SUDCare. PROJECT NARRATIVE Substance use disorder (SUD) is a growing trend in the United States, and primary care providers have limited resources to help patients with prevention and treatment. In this Phase I SBIR, we will employ a user-centered design approach to develop and demonstrate the acceptability and feasibility of an innovative mobile- and web- based toolkit, SUDCare, for primary care patients who are at risk for SUD. SUDCare will be designed to comprehensively support SUD prevention and treatment following an empirically-based protocol through an enhanced remote screening tool and novel chatbot that delivers follow-up care tailored to the patient’s SUD risk level.",SUDCare: A smart mobile tool to support substance use screening and follow-up care,9897003,R43DA050218,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Assessment tool', 'Blinded', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'English Language', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Administration', 'Series', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'care providers', 'chatbot', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mobile application', 'model design', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'primary care setting', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'reduced substance use', 'referral services', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'screening and brief intervention', 'screening, brief intervention, referral, and treatment', 'standard care', 'statistics', 'substance use prevention', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'trend', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'virtual']",NIDA,"DIMAGI, INC.",R43,2020,229810,-0.027668540154534096
"A software product that empowers individuals affected by substance use disorders and their care teams with health and social resources Project Summary Access to community resources such as housing, food, transportation and medication also known as social determinants of health (SDOH) has been shown to be critical for a successful treatment and recovery of substance use disorders (SUD). Therefore, case managers and social workers at various points-of-care (e.g. law enforcement sobering centers, primary health centers) dedicate time to identify community resources that may address their patients’ health and social barriers. However, identifying competent community resources remains a challenge as they are usually stored in manual “referral binders” which are highly duplicated and fragmented across organizations. Therefore, this significantly contributes to lack of direct access to recovery capital for individuals affected by SUD. Based on preliminary data and interviews with case managers and social workers, this SBIR Phase I study has two objectives. 1) Evaluate whether a co-creation led business model that will leverage partnerships with organizations that have SUD subject matter expertise (e.g. Houston Recovery Center - https://houstonrecoverycenter.org/) can provide enhanced access to SUD treatment services and community resources at the point-of-care. This is important as most points-of-care particularly primary health centers may not have care teams highly experienced in curating SUD related resources. Therefore, our innovation will facilitate the flow of SUD related community resources from organizations with SUD subject matter expertise to those without, such as primary health centers. 2) Establish the feasibility of a novel computational natural language processing (NLP) algorithm in matching health and social needs identified at the point-of-care to relevant and competent community resources. Our hypothesis is that the co-creation led business model coupled with a novel computational natural language processing (NLP) algorithm will lead to enhanced access to appropriate SUD recovery and healthcare resources. Finally, upon successful completion of Phase I, a future Phase II project will focus on establishing whether these innovations have a positive impact on the utilization of SUD recovery support services, encounters with law enforcement and EMS services. Project Narrative Social factors such as housing, transportation and medication have a significant impact on substance use treatment and recovery outcomes. This Phase I proposal will establish a novel co-creation model that leverages local community partnerships to curate community resources. In addition, our novel software technology prototype will match patients’ health and social needs with resources at the point-of-care to improve the quality of care for patients with substance use disorders.",A software product that empowers individuals affected by substance use disorders and their care teams with health and social resources,9984913,R43DA051063,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Businesses', 'Capital', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Distal', 'Employment', 'Food', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Law Enforcement', 'Licensing', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Quality of Care', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Impacts', 'Social Work', 'Social Workers', 'Software Engineering', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'United States', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'commercialization', 'community partnership', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'opioid overdose', 'outreach', 'peer', 'phase 1 study', 'point of care', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relapse risk', 'social', 'social factors', 'social health determinants', 'societal costs', 'tool', 'treatment services']",NIDA,"MEDICAL INNOVATORS COMPANY, LLC",R43,2020,224865,-0.06294428535544103
"Developing a Data-Driven Management System Using Machine Learning and Mixed-Methods Research to Predict Job Turnover Among MentalHealth Professionals Project Summary/Abstract The main goal of this study is to build a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system that can inform effective recruitment and retention strategies to prevent excessive turnover. High turnover rates (estimated 25-60% annually) are devastating for mental health care systems, affecting organizations (e.g., cost), employees (e.g., work well-being), and most critically, the quality of care. Human resource departments collect extensive employee data that can be useful predictors for turnover, but these data are not often analyzed to address turnover issues in mental health organizations. Computational methods have greatly evolved and can now access and analyze large and complex data. This pilot study will achieve three specific aims: Aim 1: build and test turnover prediction models by developing and applying machine learning algorithms to existing human resource data; Aim 2: generate critical questions to enhance turnover prediction through qualitative methods; and Aim 3: test the enhanced model in predicting turnover at 12 months. In Aim 1, using past human resource data and service encounters from [two mental health organizations (rural and urban locations)], we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict turnover. The algorithms will address turnover questions simultaneously (e.g., Who are the most likely to leave? What factors predict turnover at varying time points in employment?). In Aim 2, we will interview key informants: “leavers” (employees who voluntarily terminate employment during the study); “stayers” (employees with extreme longevity in the organization); and “predictees” (identified as likely to leave, based on our algorithms). The findings will be discussed in two focus groups in order to generate, refine, and validate 5-10 critical questions to enhance prediction of turnover. In Aim 3, we will conduct an on-line survey of all current employees to assess the 5-10 critical questions and link survey data with data from human resources and services to examine the improved precision between the theory-based model (predictors in the survey) and the data-driven model (machine learning algorithms) in predicting actual turnover 12 months later. Machine learning can model complex and dynamic variable relationships (e.g., handling a large number of variables, accounting for heterogeneity) and overcome limitations in traditional turnover research that often relies on small, cross-sectional, and convenience samples. Successful completion of this study will promote data-driven, evidence-based organizational management practices to address turnover, which is aligned with NIMH priorities of capitalizing on existing data structures and using technologies to improve mental health service quality. This study will be a critical step in developing highly adaptable machine learning algorithms to predict turnover; ultimately, we envision that this system will be partnered with future clinical interventions to reduce turnover in mental health. Project Narrative This pilot study will build a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system to inform effective recruitment and retention strategies for preventing excessive employee turnover in mental health organizations. Successful retention of a quality workforce not only helps mental health organizations and their employees, but also directly impacts the quality of care that clients receive. In addition, a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system could be partnered with clinical interventions to reduce turnover.",Developing a Data-Driven Management System Using Machine Learning and Mixed-Methods Research to Predict Job Turnover Among MentalHealth Professionals,9895943,R34MH119411,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Community Mental Health Centers', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Effectiveness', 'Employee', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupations', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personnel Turnover', 'Pilot Projects', 'Practice Management', 'Predictive Factor', 'Productivity', 'Professional Burnout', 'Psyche structure', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'burnout', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'data resource', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'heterogenous data', 'human data', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental health organization', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'retention rate', 'rural area', 'structured data', 'theories', 'treatment services', 'urban area']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R34,2020,244635,-0.0007329143851101589
"Identifying palliative care needs among hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease PROJECT SUMMARY Millions of Americans with COPD experience burdensome symptoms, reduced quality of life, and undesirable end-of-life care. Increasing palliative care for this vulnerable population is widely advocated to improve these important patient-centered outcomes. Yet patients with COPD rarely receive palliative care due, in part, to difficulties identifying which patients have unmet palliative care needs and palliative care workforce shortages. The proposed study's core objective is to address the national priority of improving palliative care for patients with COPD by developing an efficient, innovative, and patient-centered method to identify those with unmet palliative care needs. Specifically, the candidate seeks to (1) assess patients with COPD to determine their palliative care needs; (2) develop and validate an electronic health record-based classification model for each domain of palliative care needs; and (3) evaluate the relationship between the probability of having unmet palliative care needs and patient-centered clinical outcomes. The study will involve an in-person cross- sectional survey of 432 hospitalized patients with COPD of any stage. Participants will complete a validated survey to capture a wide variety of palliative care needs, which will be supplemented with expert chart review to identify patients with needs in any of three clinically relevant and actionable domains. These cases will be used as the patient-reported reference standard for development and validation of domain-specific classification models leveraging natural language processing of unstructured clinical text in electronic health records and machine learning methods. Finally, a large, multicenter retrospective cohort study will evaluate the associations between different probabilities of having unmet palliative care needs and several clinical outcomes important to patients, caregivers, and hospitals. This will enable the identification of thresholds of probabilities of unmet needs above which COPD patients' risks of undesirable clinical outcomes increase. Such patients will then be targeted for enrollment in future trials testing interventions to improve these outcomes. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, an F32-supported post-doctoral fellowship, and a career development award from the National Palliative Care Research Center, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. The candidate's rigorous training plan, focused on obtaining advanced skills in multisite prospective research, patient-centered outcomes research, and advanced bioinformatics methods will allow her to submit successful R01 or PCORI applications testing interventions directly informed by the results of this work. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a supportive environment for her to develop an independent research career focused on improving the uptake and effectiveness of palliative care for patients with COPD and other cardiopulmonary diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients with COPD experience burdensome symptoms, reduced quality of life, and low quality end-of-life care. Palliative care may improve such outcomes, yet resources are strained and it is difficult to identify which patients are most in need. The aims of this research are to provide new knowledge regarding the unmet palliative care needs of patients with COPD and to develop a novel and scalable method to identify patients with such needs in order to reduce patients' suffering and improve quality of life.",Identifying palliative care needs among hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,10004708,K23HL143181,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'American', 'Award', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Calibration', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Consult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marital Status', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Social Work', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinical center', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'experience', 'functional status', 'hospital services', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'physical symptom', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'readmission rates', 'recruit', 'skills', 'study population', 'supportive environment', 'unstructured data', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2020,173628,0.030883702578896652
"An artificial intelligence-driven distributed stereotactic radiosurgery strategy for multiple brain metastases management PROJECT SUMMARY Brain metastases (BMs) are a life-threatening neurological disease, but current treatment regimens cannot manage multiple (>4) BMs (mBMs) without causing strong adverse effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), utilizing potent dose to irradiate BMs and quick dose falloff to spare nearby tissues, has proven to be an effective treatment regimen for limited-number and small-size BMs. However, SRS could not avoid high toxic dose when BMs are multiple, clustered, or adjacent to critical organs. To safe and effectively treat mBMs with SRS requires addressing these urgent needs: 1) to identify the maximum tolerable SRS dose; 2) to study neurocognitive decline and design strategies to preserve patients’ post-treatment quality of life; and 3) to develop and implement high-quality streamlined mBMs SRS treatment and follow-up care. To address mBMs SRS management needs, we aim to develop and implement an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven treatment planning system (TPS) and conduct a therapeutic intervention clinical trial, both dedicated to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality and efficiency. The AI-driven TPS, namely AimBMs, will have three AI- based computational modules, including AI-Segtor for automatic segmentation, AI-Predictor for treatment outcome prediction and AI-Planner for spatiotemporal distributed SRS plan optimization. AimBMs is initially developed based on retrospective data and facilitate the mBMs distributed SRS prospective phase I/II clinical trials, while the clinical trial will provide critical clinical knowledge and evidence as feedback to improve AimBMs performance. The ultimate goal of the project is to translate the AimBMs to routine clinical practice to improve mBMs SRS treatment quality, patients’ post-treatment QoL, and clinical facility workflow. In response to PAR-18-560, we have formed a multidisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and medical physicists to develop a novel AI-driven distributed SRS technology and conduct a cancer-targeted therapeutic intervention for managing mBMs. The project’s innovations include: 1) novel SRS treatment planning technological capability enabled by AI-based auto-segmentation, treatment outcome prediction, and spatiotemporal plan optimization; 2) novel AI learning capability to improve developed AI tools’ performance through the coherent clinical trial. The technology development will support the therapeutic intervention clinical trial, while the clinical trial is designated to improve the developed system performance. This seamlessly integrated development mode ensures the developed system is clinically practical. Upon completion, our newly developed AimBMs will lay a solid foundation for mBMs SRS management and benefit a wide population of patients with BMs. Moreover, the AI-based treatment planning and treatment delivery infrastructure built for mBMs SRS can be transferred to other tumor sites to generate an even broader clinical impact.

"Assisted living communities- transforming predictive data into proactive care for COVID-19 ABSTRACT Recent data suggests that that older Americans who contact COVID-19 are at greatest risk for hospitalization and poor outcomes. Additionally, due to advanced age and their high likelihood of having multiple chronic conditions, adults in senior living facilities are at highest risk for developing COVID-19, its most serious complications, and dying. Since the identification of first US case of novel coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) in the Seattle, Washington, several outbreaks have been identified in long-term care and assisted living facilities with evidence of rapid spread. Older residents and the staff of long-term care assisted living facilities as well as public health officials are facing a multitude of challenges which render early detection of COVID-19 infections difficult in these facilities and which have posed a major barrier to the efforts to control the spread of infection. Adding to these challenges, more than half of residents with positive COVID-19 test results are asymptomatic at the time of testing, further contributing to transmission. There is an urgent unmet need for strategies for monitoring of residents in long-term care and assisted living facilities to facilitate early detection of the infection using means that require minimal person-to-person contact. While the dynamics of COVID-19 infection spread is being addressed by several contact tracing apps, assessing the risk for development of severe symptoms and hospitalization in these community residents requires active physiological monitoring and ecological momentary assessment in the context of preexisting clinical conditions and presents an immediate unmet need. With this project, we propose to deliver a user- friendly COVID-19 early detection alert platform (COVID-Alert) that integrates: 1) biosensor ensemble that noninvasively and continuously monitor and record critical vital signs (temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and activity level); 2) ecological momentary assessment (EMA) using the 5-question set released by CDC and adopted across US by healthcare providers and health insurance industry; 3) artificial intelligence framework that triggers an alert based on synthesis of real-time physiological biosensing data feed, EMA monitoring of symptoms, with personalized risk profiles of preexisting conditions derived from electronic health record maintained by the facility. COVID-19 clinical decision support integrated into the workflow of long-term care facilities will ensure that residents receive appropriate and timely care (resident level) and ongoing surveillance to prevent an outbreak (facility level) while avoiding unnecessary staff exposure. This study brings together a strong interdisciplinary team of experts in engineering, informatics, data science, machine learning, and CDS. The advanced data-driven predictive model will be trained and validated using both high-dimensional EHR data and clinician feedback. The process of the algorithm development and clinical implementation will be closely monitored and evaluated through formative and summative evaluation. NARRATIVE Due to advanced age and their high likelihood of having multiple chronic conditions, adults in senior living facilities are at highest risk for hospitalization from COVID-19, its most serious complications, and dying. Our team will develop and perform formative and summative evaluation of a COVID-19 early detection/hospitalization risk prediction platform, which will provide actionable clinical decision support.

"Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities In the United States (US), an estimated 20 million adults have been diagnosed with substance use disorder (SUD). A major challenge for patients is to identify the most appropriate treatment with the best outcomes. Patients receive care in outpatient and inpatient facilities yet quality metrics at the level of these individual facilities are not publicly available.  In the era of digital data, the Internet and peer-to-peer resources are often the first place where individuals look to find information about healthcare resources. Online reviews on sites like Google and Yelp provide narratives about healthcare facilities and assign easily interpretable star ratings ranging from one to five stars. These reviews of healthcare facilities provide information about patient experience, structure (e.g. physical education) facility, organizational characteristics, payment methods), process (e.g. diagnosis, treatment, patient and outcomes (e.g. knowledge, health-related quality of life morbidity, mortality).  Prior work has demonstrated that online ratings of hospitals correlate with ratings from the national Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. Little work however has evaluated the utility of unvalidated, spontaneously generated, but widely accessible online reviews of SUD treatment facilities. These reviews could fill a niche with providing patients and their family members with useful information about the questions and experiences that are most important to them. Or these reviews could be limited and provide misinformation or only biased perspectives. To date, less is known about the potential value or usefulness of this emerging data source.  For this proposal we aim to study online reviews of SUD treatment facilities in the US to identify the areas of care that are reported as most important to patients and family members. For Aim 1, we will first extract approximately 50,000 online reviews of SUD treatment facilities and code them for themes using qualitative methodologies that involve manual coding and big data analytics using machine learning and natural language processing. We hypothesize that these online narratives will include qualitative data about patient experience and the type and quality of care (e.g. evidence-based treatments) provided at SUD treatment facilities. For Aim 2, we will then assess how star ratings differentiate facilities relative to structure and process measures reported in the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services.  Overall, emerging online data resources have the potential to provide new information about a critically vulnerable population affected by the opioid and more broadly the SUD crisis. Our project seeks to rigorously study these new patient-centric data sources viewed by millions of individuals for the purposes of better understanding the needs of patients and family members. These efforts can lay the groundwork for future work in developing measures of quality for a critically important healthcare resource, SUD treatment facilities. Narrative We aim to evaluate narratives and star ratings from online reviews to assess how this consumer generated, data can inform our understanding of care delivery for substance use disorder (SUD). Identifying the themes and measures of quality revealed in these reviews and how they relate to traditional measures of quality could inform future development of patient centric performance measures and ratings for SUD treatment facilities.",Analyzing Online Reviews to Evaluate Quality of Care at Substance Use Disorder Treatment Facilities,9956035,R21DA050761,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Addiction', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physical Education', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cost', 'data resource', 'digital', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'insight', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'mortality', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'patient engagement', 'payment', 'peer', 'satisfaction', 'substance abuse treatment', 'treatment center', 'treatment program', 'treatment services', 'urgent care', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2020,243000,-0.02939131353791494
"Development of a reminiscence therapy online platform with machine learning to increase engagement with people living with dementia and their care partners PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or AD-related dementias, and the number of affected individuals is rapidly growing. Symptoms include impaired cognition, resulting in difficulty in performing daily activities and consequent functional dependence on others. The progressive nature of AD and ADRD can result in increasing degrees of care required from professional and family caregivers. Non- pharmacologic interventions positively influence cognition, mood, and other behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and one well-established intervention, life story work (the use of written and oral life histories), serves as an effective technique that can elicit conversation and memories in those with AD and ADRD. However, generating useful life story materials is a time-consuming task for caregivers. To overcome this barrier, LifeBio Inc. is developing a reminiscence therapy platform —LifeBio MemoryTM— with a novel machine-learning-based application that converts speech to text and generates life stories to serve as an interactive tool to cultivate communication between people living with dementia and their family and caregivers. The LifeBio MemoryTM platform application will elicit and store individuals’ stories, photos, and videos and ultimately deliver personalized, point-of-care reminiscence therapy exercises for patients. In preliminary work supporting this Direct-to-Phase II proposal, LifeBio Inc. partnered with the Benjamin Rose Institute on Aging to conduct a pilot study in nursing homes, which showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms among participants in LifeBio Inc.’s intervention and revealed that the majority of participants considered knowledge of their life story to be important for caregivers, while caregivers also reported positive experiences in relation to the impact of the intervention on caregiving. In this project we will: 1) Develop prototype enhancements of the existing LifeBio program and conduct focus group evaluations of these prototypes with 12 existing or former LifeBio users, 20 dementia care professionals familiar with LifeBio and 6 older adults with early-stage dementia to help maintain person-centered practices throughout the research process; 2) Finalize the LifeBio Memory product, which will include the development of a system to automatically record and process individuals’ life stories. 3) Conduct a full-scale fidelity trial of the complete package with 40 care professionals and 160 dementia care dyads across within an assisted living setting. The product of this Direct-to-Phase II proposal, LifeBio Memory™, will be a novel, scalable, and easily implemented solution through which caregivers and healthcare providers can offer person-centered care to people living with AD and AD-related dementias. PROJECT NARRATIVE Non-pharmacological interventions and person-centered care strategies are important elements of care for people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Life story work, which uses written and oral life histories to elicit conversation and memories, is an effective intervention for individuals with dementia; however, because of the time-consuming nature of generating useful life story materials, has not been widely implemented in nursing homes and other care environments.

"Transforming residential palliative care for persons with dementia through behavioral economics and data science The central goal of this proposed Roybal Center is to develop, test, and implement novel interventions that bridge the dramatic gap between the supply of and need for palliative care services among persons with dementia (PWD) living in long-term services and support (LTSS) facilities, as well as their family caregivers. Several innovative aspects of this proposed Center position us to succeed in this challenging but increasingly important space. First, we have assembled a team comprising more 50 investigators and staff from 5 schools within the University of Pennsylvania, and the most accomplished investigators of palliative approaches to care for PWD from 11 peer institutions. These investigators possess content knowledge and tremendous expertise in leading all Stages of behavioral intervention development as defined by the NIH Stage Model. Second, we will support these behavioral scientists by linking them with Center faculty with expertise in several key methodologic areas including behavioral economics, data science, statistics, qualitative methods, health policy and economics, and implementation science. Our focus on translating behavioral economic insights to change the behaviors of clinicians and caregivers involved in the care of PWD builds on our recent success using similar approaches to improve palliative care delivery in outpatient and hospital settings. Our focus on using machine learning, natural language processing, and network methods will enable us to (a) identify mechanisms of clinician behavior that account for aggressive care for PWD, (b) identify PWD with the greatest unmet palliative care needs so as to sustainably target intervention delivery, and (c) more efficiently measure person-centered outcomes in the context of large, pragmatic trials of the most promising interventions. Third, this Center is being launched in partnership with Genesis HealthCare, the nation's largest owner of LTSS facilities, with 401 nursing homes and assisted living facilities across the U.S. These facilities provide ideal settings within which to develop and test interventions that will be effective and sustainable in the real world. Further, by developing and testing the interventions in these settings, while continually increasing our collaborations with other owners of LTSS facilities, we will be ideally positioned to implement effective interventions in the places in which the majority of Americans with dementia are cared for near the end of life. This Center will be directed by a Steering Committee, and will include a Management and Administrative Core housed within Penn's existing Palliative and Advanced Illness Research (PAIR) Center. A Pilot Core will select, guide, and monitor pilot projects chosen for funding each year. We propose two pilots for funding in the first year: a Stage I study that seeks to adapt a web-based advance care planning platform for use among PWD and their caregivers in LTSS settings, and a Stage 0 study that will use data science methods to identify clinician behaviors associated with hospitalization risk among PWD, yielding targets for future interventions. NARRATIVE Although most persons with dementia (PWD) die in nursing homes and other long-term services and support (LTSS) facilities, few interventions have improved the processes or outcomes of care for such patients. This Roybal Center will unite junior and senior physician, nurse, and social scientists with expertise in Stages 0-V behavioral intervention studies, behavioral economics, and data science with a shared goal to develop, test, and implement interventions to change the behaviors of clinicians and caregivers for PWD in LTSS facilities. We will achieve this goal by partnering with the nation's leading researchers in palliative care for PWD and the largest owner of nursing homes, using its facilities as sites for the pilot studies we will support.",Transforming residential palliative care for persons with dementia through behavioral economics and data science,10017845,P30AG064105,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Advance Care Planning', 'American', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family Nursing', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Process', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Site', 'Social Network', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'care systems', 'caregiver interventions', 'cost', 'dementia care', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy study', 'electronic data', 'end of life', 'health economics', 'hospice environment', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'palliative', 'peer', 'person centered', 'pragmatic trial', 'social', 'statistics', 'success', 'symptom management', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P30,2020,758973,0.037903802127956666
"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients. This mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research will develop and test methods to surmount these three barriers in the context of a multifaceted training program that will make the Principal Investigator a more effective mentor and team leader.",Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure,9971553,K24HL143289,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advance Directives', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical trial enrollment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'financial incentive', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized approach', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'student mentoring', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'uptake', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K24,2020,119199,0.002037969108293079
"Aligning Patient Acuity with Intensity of Care after Surgery ABSTRACT A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate with the training and resources necessary to develop expertise and experience in large-scale, multi-institutional informatics research using electronic health record data and machine learning to develop clinical decision-support tools. This proposal builds toward the candidate’s long-term career goal of becoming an independent surgeon-scientist with expertise in design and implementation of machine learning systems to augment clinical decision-making. To accomplish this goal, the candidate and mentors propose a systematic investigation of postoperative ‘patient acuity’ (i.e., risk for critical illness and death) and ‘intensity of care’ (i.e., triage destination and frequency of vital sign and laboratory measurements). After major surgery, misaligned patient acuity and intensity of care can lead to preventable harm and inappropriate resource use, affecting approximately 15 million inpatient surgeries annually in the US alone. When high-acuity patients receive low-intensity care, postoperative complications can progress to critical illness and cardiac arrest. Providing high-intensity care to low-acuity patients has low value and may cause harm through unnecessary treatments. It is difficult to address these problems systematically because there is no validated, unifying ‘intensity of care’ definition. The overall objective of this application is to understand intensity of care decision spaces in surgical patients and match them to clinical phenotypes and outcomes, leveraging this knowledge to generate precise, autonomous decision-support tools. The central hypothesis of this application is that inappropriate postoperative intensity of care is common, predictable, and associated with increased short- and long-term mortality, morbidity, and hospital costs. The rationale for this work is that integrating electronic health record data, machine learning, and clinical domain expertise offers opportunities to understand postoperative intensity of care decisions and develop decision-support tools capable of optimizing clinical outcomes and resource use. The specific aims of this proposal are to (1) develop and validate postoperative intensity of care definitions, (2) develop and validate interpretable, actionable acuity assessments that elucidate decision spaces, and (3) identify and predict postoperative intensity of care phenotypes. The proposed research is significant because it addresses a problem that affects millions of patients annually and is associated with potentially preventable harm and suboptimal resource use. The approach is innovative because the candidate and mentors are unaware of any prior attempts to classify and adjudicate postoperative intensity of care and understand the phenotypes and characteristics of patients receiving insufficient or excessive care. During the award period, the candidate will apply for an NIH-R01 investigator-initiated award for the prospective clinical implementation of an interpretable, actionable decision support tool incorporating validated intensity of care definitions and knowledge garnered from phenotype clustering, initially in a silent data collection period followed by a live period during which clinicians are provided with model outputs and clinically actionable recommendations. NARRATIVE After major surgery, misaligned patient acuity (i.e., risk for critical illness and death) and intensity of care (i.e., triage destination and frequency of vital sign and laboratory test monitoring) can lead to preventable harm and inappropriate resource use. It is difficult to address these problems systematically because there is no validated, unifying definition of intensity of care.

"Community-Based Care for Minority Adolescents with ADHD: Improving Fidelity with Machine Learning-Assisted Supervision and Fidelity Feedback Project Summary  The proposed study will develop and evaluate a technology-assisted supervision protocol to promote treatment fidelity and more efficient delivery of evidence-based treatment (EBT) for ADHD in under-resourced community settings. The protocol (LC4S) will be grounded in the principles of measurement-based care. LC4S will task-shift basic supervision tasks to an existing machine learning tool that analyzes and codes therapy recordings for fidelity (Lyssn; lyssn.io; Tanana et al., 2019). These data will be automatically integrated into an established HIPAA-compliant online clinical dashboard that produces performance reports for therapists and supervisors (Care4; www.care4soft.net). Care4 also will be loaded with online facilitation resources for therapists, while supervisors will be trained to lead weekly in-person supervision sessions according to best practices in measurement-based care (Martino et al., 2016; Schoenwald et al., 2009; Webster-Stratton et al., 2014). This trial will be conducted in three community mental health agencies (Psych Solutions, Inc, Behavioral Aid Solutions, Jewish Community Services) in Miami-Dade County, FL that serve low income ethnic/racial minority youth and previously partnered with the research team in R01 MH106587. In Y01 of the project, we will conduct a stakeholder-focused development process for the LC4S intervention that begins with a thorough capacity and needs assessment using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR; Damschroder et al., 2009) and is guided by the Knowledge to Action (K2A) Implementation Science Framework (Graham et al., 2006). In this phase, we will hold monthly videoconference meetings between development teams at each agency, Care4, and the investigative team to iterate the final Care4 interface with an emphasis user-centered design. In year 1, we also will conduct a small open trial to obtain user feedback (12 cases, 3 supervisors, and 6 therapists) on LC4S and we will make final adaptations to the technology and protocol. In year 2, we will conduct a pilot Hybrid Type 3 Implementation- Effectiveness randomized controlled trial (Curran et al., 2012; N=72 youth; 24 youth, 8 therapists, and 2 supervisors per agency) that will randomly assign both therapists and youth to the LC4S condition or enhanced supervision as usual (ESAU). Both supervision conditions will be delivered by endogenous, agency supervisors who are trained in delivery of the EBT and the core elements of its supervision and have access to monthly phone consultation from experts. The proximal target in this R34 pilot RCT is session by session fidelity scores. The distal service delivery outcomes in this trial are: (1) quality of EBT implementation, (2) quantity of EBT delivered in standard intervention time frame, and (3) speed of delivery (i.e., number of sessions and days to EBT completion) for each case. In support of a future R01 that measures the impact of LC4S on patient outcomes across multiple EBTs, this R34 will also focus on developing and validating appropriate study measures, testing for contamination across conditions, and establishing the costs of the LC4S intervention versus ESAU. Project Narrative Evidence-based behavior therapy for ADHD demonstrates a decrement in fidelity and effectiveness when moving from university to community settings, largely due to limited resources in poor communities (Sibley, Graziano, Coxe, Bickman, & Martin, 2020). As a result, access to quality mental health care suffers among minority, socio-economically disadvantaged adolescents who commonly seek care in these settings and are at risk for the worst clinical outcomes (Sibley, Coxe, Stein, & Meinzer, 2020). Artificial Intelligence (AI) and web-based technology can be used to automate and task-shift key supervision and training tasks (i.e., fidelity monitoring and feedback, booster trainings) thus improving fidelity and effectiveness while reducing costs associated with burdensome measurement-based supervision protocols (Tanana et al., 2019).",Community-Based Care for Minority Adolescents with ADHD: Improving Fidelity with Machine Learning-Assisted Supervision and Fidelity Feedback,10112643,R34MH125037,"['Academy', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Services', 'Competence', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Cost Analysis', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family psychotherapy', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Palate', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Validity of Results', 'Videoconferences', 'Youth', 'base', 'care seeking', 'community based care', 'community setting', 'cost', 'cost estimate', 'dashboard', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'follower of religion Jewish', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'meetings', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial minority', 'service delivery', 'skills', 'social disadvantage', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment disparity', 'treatment planning', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R34,2020,359812,0.01622841443758102
"Data Driven Methods for Missing Data Imputation in Surgical Disparities Research Project Summary/Abstract Disparities in health and health care have been a longstanding challenge in the United States. One specific area of medical care in which racial/ethnic disparities have been identified is total joint arthroplasty (TJA), particularly total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA). Large, population based studies necessary to address healthcare disparities can be costly and difficult to perform, and may be compromised by sampling strategies and patient selection biases. Efficient alternatives are publicly-available nationally representative databases such as the HCUP State Inpatient Databases (SID) and National Inpatient Sample (NIS). The SID provide information on all patients admitted to hospitals within participating states, allowing for comparison of health care access among many vulnerable populations, across states, and over time. The NIS is the largest publicly-available all-payer inpatient health care database in the nation. It is sampled from the SID through a complex survey design, yielding national estimates of health care utilization, quality, and outcomes. A significant limitation of the NIS and the SID is the quantity of missing data. In particular, “patient race”, a key indicator for health disparities research, has a high proportion of missingness. Multiple imputation (MI) approaches have been increasingly popular for providing sound statistical methods to account for missing data. When conducting MI, it is suggested that imputation models be as general as data allow them to be, in order to accommodate a wide range of subsequent analyses of imputed data sets. This requires all relationships that are going to be investigated in any subsequent analysis, such as nonlinearities and interactions, to be included in the imputation model. Unfortunately, traditional MI methods, such as the multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE), are built on parametric imputation models. These models are often not flexible enough to capture interactions and nonlinearities in high dimensional and large scale data settings. Unlike parametric models, machine learning techniques (MLTs) are model-free methods, and thus provide flexibility for missing data imputation. MLTs use algorithms that automatically and iteratively learn from all data to detect statistical dependencies in observations without being explicitly programmed where to look. The goal of this study is to make the two HCUP databases a more useful resource for the study of surgical disparities and other areas of medicine. Accordingly, we propose novel MI methods based on MLTs to impute missing data in the SID and the NIS, and to use the imputed datasets to measure racial disparity in TKA. Project Narrative It would be challenging to approach the goal of eliminating healthcare disparities without identifying disparities and analyzing the underlying causes using nationally representative databases such as the HCUP SID and NIS. This proposal imputes missing data for surgical disparities research using the two databases.",Data Driven Methods for Missing Data Imputation in Surgical Disparities Research,10023939,R01MD013901,"['Address', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Population Study', 'Race', 'Records', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'administrative database', 'autoencoder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'health care availability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'high dimensionality', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'large scale data', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial disparity', 'random forest', 'simulation', 'software development', 'sound', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'usability']",NIMHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,245156,-0.0009008693186648441
"eMERGE IV Northwest: A partnership to evaluate the use of genomic information in the health care of diverse participants Project Abstract eMERGE IV (E4) proposes to investigate the implementation of 15 “genomic risk assessment” (GRA) scores in a network-wide set of diverse participants. These GRAs will include polygenic risk score (PRS) information, as well as risk information, such as personal and family health history, environmental and social health determinants, and physical and lab measures. The GRA will aggregate these factors into a single score to identify those who would benefit from screening and other interventions. Substantial challenges must be addressed before genomic medicine is a part of standard medical care. We will collaborate to refine multi-ancestry GRAs and support the inclusion of non-genetic risk factors extracted from the electronic health record with innovative natural language processing approaches and apply them in a cohort enriched for Asian ancestry, and sexual and gender minorities. The specific aims of our proposal are designed to use an implementation science approach to advance the integration of genomic data into clinical practice, including evaluation of patient perspectives and economic outcomes, and broadening the impact of eMERGE through collaborations. The University of Washington Medicine dedication to preventative health in a learning health system and broad expertise across genomics, statistical, ethical, informatic, implementation, outcomes and economic disciplines will support this multi-site clinical trial. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Refine GRA scores and outcomes measures for five high impact conditions, considering stakeholder input, for implementation in the electronic health record. The conditions are: colorectal cancer, breast cancer, osteoporosis, coronary artery disease, and glaucoma. Aim 2: Integrate 15 GRA scores and electronic clinical decision support for management into clinical care and the EHR and capture clinical outcomes. Aim 3: Evaluate the implementation, effectiveness, and economic utility of GRA result return. Project Narrative As part of the eMERGE IV (E4) Network clinical trial, we propose to develop 5, and investigate the implementation of 15, “genomic risk assessment” (GRA) scores in a large set of diverse participants.

"Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist committed to improving the quality of patient-oriented research for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Worldwide, millions of patients develop ARF annually. In the U.S., nearly one million patients with ARF require mechanical ventilation annually, accounting for a quarter of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As improvements in ICU care reduce such patients’ in-hospital mortality rates, attention has shifted to the challenges ARF survivors face in regaining their prior cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning. However, there is a key barrier for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing new interventions to improve ARF survivorship – that is, the current lack of an endpoint that (1) captures long-term patient dispositions, (2) incorporates patient preferences and perspectives, and (3) is able to be analyzed without concern for statistical biases. The overarching goal of this research is to support clinical innovation by developing new approaches to measure and report long-term patient-centered outcomes that overcome the methodological barriers currently limiting ARF RCTs. The applicant will accomplish his goals under the mentorship of established researchers in critical care, patient-centered outcomes research, statistics, and informatics to assure his transition to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist. First, the applicant will use an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit and integrate ARF survivors’ and their caregivers’ perspectives into a new patient-centered, long-term composite outcome measure (K99 phase). During the R00 phase, the applicant will recruit ARF survivors to participate in a prospective cohort, and follow these patients to describe the burden of ARF survivorship over 1-year using the new endpoint developed during the K99 phase. This endeavor will also provide key data that will facilitate sample size calculations in future ARF RCTs. Data from this cohort will additionally be used to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm to predict risks for adverse long-term outcomes among ARF patients early in their ICU stays. Thus, this K99/R00 will augment ARF research by establishing a new outcome measure anchored in patient perspectives, improving the understanding and clinical prognostication of post-ICU morbidity following ARF, and facilitate the efficiency and clinical relevance of future ARF RCTs by enabling measurement of patients’ baseline risks for different outcomes. Concurrently, the didactic work, individual study, and hands-on learning in mixed-methods research, natural language processing, and predictive analytics will fill key training gaps for the applicant, thereby positioning him for a successful, independently-funded research career advancing the science of outcomes measurement and analysis for ARF RCTs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized trials testing strategies to improve long-term outcomes for survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) are hampered by the lack of valid, patient-centered endpoints. Using interviews with ARF survivors and their caregivers, statistical simulation, consensus building among stakeholders, and a prospective cohort study, the applicant will develop, describe the epidemiology of, and predict a new patient-oriented outcome that will support trials of innovative approaches to improve ARF survivorship outcomes.","Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure",9967226,R00HL141678,"['Accounting', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rogaine', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'experience', 'hands-on learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient health information', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'residence', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'structured data', 'survivorship', 'tenure track', 'unstructured data', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R00,2020,249000,0.007854118981149301
"Conceptualizing Actionability in Clinical Genomic Screening Project Summary/Abstract. Clinical genomic sequencing (CGS) produces large amounts of data, much of which is hard to characterize or may have a negligible influence on health. The concept of actionability is commonly used to help separate information that may be useful from information that is likely irrelevant for patients. Actionability directs attention to whether genomic information warrants action and reflects its initial development as a strategy to augment diagnosis and treatment in sick patients. As CGS expands towards healthy populations in primary care settings, actionability is still widely embraced despite little consensus regarding its definition and use. Because this ambiguity could become an obstacle to the successful implementation of clinical genomic sequencing in healthy populations, greater clarity about this concept is necessary. The proposed research will fulfill this need by characterizing the emergence and varied meanings of actionability in clinical genomics, focusing on clinical genomics' transition into primary care settings. By identifying underlying values and assumptions related to actionability, this research will push beyond definitional disputes and provide a deeper framework for assessing how genetic information is valued. The specific aims are: 1. Identify and characterize, through in-depth interviews, how genomics experts and primary care providers conceptualize what makes genomic information actionable for healthy populations. 2. Identify and characterize, through a natural language processing (NLP) analysis of published literature, how the concept of actionability emerged, spread, and is used throughout clinical genomics. 3. Convene a workshop with genomics experts, primary care providers, and ELSI scholars to produce a white paper on actionability and the ethical, effective integration of CGS into primary care, guided by the results from Aims 1 and 2. This K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award includes a highly-structured, mentored training program that will support the candidate's goal to become an independent, mixed-methods ELSI investigator focused on assessing the value of genomic information. To achieve this career goal, the candidate will: 1. Receive training in genetic and genomic science to facilitate collaboration with genomics care teams and make scientifically accurate policy recommendations 2. Build new methodological skills in biomedical informatics and natural language processing to conduct generalizable research 3. Publish and engage with scientific and medical audiences to have a more direct impact on future guidelines and policies. 4. Develop a collaborative and interdisciplinary research network. This training will include coursework, guided readings, network building, and sustained mentorship by a highly-qualified team of faculty with expertise in ELSI research, bioethics, clinical genomics, biomedical informatics, and the history and sociology of medicine. This training will prepare the candidate to transition to an independent ELSI investigator focused on ethical issues related to the actionability of genomic health information – an ELSI research priority in Genetic and Genomic Healthcare. Project Narrative. This K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award will prepare the candidate to become an independent, mixed-methods ELSI researcher pursing a research program on ethical issues related to the actionability of genomic information.

"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,10131376,R44AG065118,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Centers for Population Health', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health care facility', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use Effectiveness', 'aging in place', 'aging population', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'database structure', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2020,1992588,-0.013814876938509156
"Transforming Kidney Care in the Emergency Department using Artificial Intelligence Driven Clinical Decision Support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this proposal is to determine best-practice methods for incorporating artificial intelligence (AI)- derived insights into emergency care. This investigation will use the iterative development and evaluation of an AI-driven clinical decision support (CDS) system to prevent or mitigate acute kidney injury (AKI) as a reference use-case. We are responding to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice: Health Services Research Priorities for Achieving a High Value Healthcare System (NOT-HS-18-015), calling for research on prevention of disease through incorporation of AI into healthcare and on interventions to prevent kidney disease progression. Emergency departments (EDs) deliver high-volume patient care in hazardous decision-making environments fraught with excessive cognitive loading and time-pressure. AI has potential to support ED clinician decisions by exploiting large-scale electronic health record (EHR) data to aid prognosis, extract signal from noise, and reduce untoward variability in practice. Despite AI’s fervent promotion, translation to practice is rare and means to incorporate AI that is trustworthy, transparent, and explainable in the ED are unknown. AKI is an important target for AI-driven predictive modeling. It is prevalent and strongly associated with adverse outcomes including dialysis and death, yet is under-recognized and therefore under-treated. In addition, many ED treatments inadvertently promote the progression of AKI and kidney disease. AKI prevention is achievable with evidence-based CDS at the point of care. We will use our AI-driven model, with proven capacity for early and reliable AKI risk estimation, to achieve the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Develop an AI-driven algorithm for promotion of AKI-focused clinical decision-making in the ED. We will leverage previously developed AKI surveillance and prediction tools to generate a unified EHR-based algorithm that empowers ED clinician prevention of kidney disease progression. Aim 2: Translate the AI algorithm to an AKI-CDS system to enable in-depth study of Clinician-AI interactions in the ED. We will establish end-user requirements while creating data collection instruments to examine AI in the ED. Both efforts will support the development of the AKI-CDS system to pilot and investigate ED clinician perceptions of AI trustworthiness and explainability in preparation for multi-site implementation. Aim 3: Perform a multi-site effectiveness-implementation evaluation of the AKI-CDS system in the ED. We will implement the AI-driven CDS system across three ED study sites using a pragmatic investigational framework to perform effectiveness and implementation evaluations in parallel. The research proposed will generate new knowledge and tools to advance the study of AI in the ED, and will result in a scalable CDS product with the capacity to improve the quality of kidney care delivered to more than 1 million patients affected by AKI in the US each year.

"Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of diabetic macular edema Approximately 25% of the millions of veterans (est. 8.92 million FY 2013) enrolled for care in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have diabetes mellitus, and diabetic macular edema (DME) is the leading cause of vision loss in the adult diabetic population world-wide. Although diabetic retinopathy has been well-studied, comparatively little is known about the burden of DME. In fact, only two national prevalence studies and no national study on the incidence of DME in persons with type 2 diabetes have been conducted. Similarly many risk factors have been characterized for DR, but no large studies have established predictors for DME.  Beyond the Medicare claims database, the VHA National Patient Care Database (NPCD) contains standardized administrative data for several aspects of patient care including diagnoses, procedures, medications, lab test results, vital signs, clinical text notes, and mortality. Because the VA uses teleretinal screening as routine clinical care for all patients with diabetes with these results included in the NPCD, the NPCD is an ideal source for studying the epidemiology of and risk factors for DME.  This study proposes to determine the burden of diabetic macular edema, establish risk factors, and examine treatment outcomes in a previously extracted dataset on 1.98 million veterans who have undergone diabetic retinopathy screening at least once since 2004. Currently invaluable ophthalmic data are encoded in unstructured clinical encounter notes in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and no validated automated extraction method exists to capture these data elements. An automated extraction method using natural language processing will be created and validated to unlock key ophthalmic variables. These text extraction methods will be applicable to extracting ophthalmology data from not only notes of patients with DME but also any ophthalmology clinical note. This will enable future large scale studies in ophthalmology using NPCD and be immediately valuable to the research community at large.  The candidate, Dr. Aaron Lee, MD MSCI, is an ophthalmologist with subspecialty training in retina surgery with a strong background in computer science and epidemiology. His career goal is to become an independent clinician scientist studying diabetic eye disease with large-scale electronic medical record extracted data. While he possesses the foundational skills, he seeks to gain training in advanced statistics and natural language processing to unlock the data captured in unstructured clinical encounter notes. He has assembled an outstanding mentorship team under the primary mentor, Dr. Edward Boyko, MD MPH. This mentorship team includes renowned experts in clinical epidemiology, health informatics, ophthalmology, and natural language processing. This K23 will provide Dr. Lee the structured coursework, mentorship, and applied learning needed to acquire new research skills. He will leverage key local resources to carry out the proposed research at the University of Washington and the VA Seattle Epidemiologic Research and Information Center. Despite the significant visual loss associated with diabetic macular edema, little is known about the frequency of its occurrence, its risk factors, and the real-world effectiveness of existing treatments. The purpose of this proposed research is to utilize the VA National Patient Care Database to extract relevant data elements to examine these three clinical questions: 1) what is the incidence and prevalence of diabetic macular edema, 2) what are the risk factors associated with its development, and 3) what is the comparative real-world effectiveness of its treatments, including intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, intravitreal corticosteroid therapy and macular laser.

"Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs 1 PROJECT SUMMARY  Millions of U.S. adults living with prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk of type 2 diabetes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies represent a potential scalable solution to address this far-reaching problem. The objective of this project is to compare the real-world effectiveness of a digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to standard of care in- person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs). This study will test a novel, fully-automated digital health platform (Sweetch Health, Ltd.) that uses artificial intelligence technology to provide just-in-time and adaptive lifestyle change coaching for prediabetic adults. Preliminary evidence from feasibility or observational studies suggests that JITAIs, which are often delivered via smartphone apps by virtue of their ability to provide continuous self-monitoring and feedback, can be effective. However, it is currently not known whether dDPPs that deliver a JITAI are as effective as ipDPPs in improving health outcomes in patients with prediabetes, a susceptible patient population that is positioned to benefit from such an intervention.  The overarching goal of this project, therefore, is to compare the effectiveness of the Sweetch digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to real-world in-person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs) for promoting weight loss, increasing physical activity, and reducing hemoglobin A1C in prediabetic adults. The proposed study addresses an evidence gap in the science of chronic disease prevention and health behavior change and is supported by promising short-term results from a previous pilot trial conducted by our team. Building on our previous study and leveraging the collective expertise of our multidisciplinary study team, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 382 overweight/obese, prediabetic adults ages 18-75 with 6 and 12 month follow-up visits: Arm 1 (N=191) will receive the fully automated Sweetch digital health kit (“dDPP” arm) and Arm 2 (N=191) will be referred to a local CDC-recognized ipDPP. Both arms will have physical activity measured serially during the trial using actimetry at baseline and 2 month intervals. We hypothesize that the dDPP will be more effective than the ipDPP for the outcomes of weight loss, physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C at 6 months, with sustained effects at 12 months. We further hypothesize that the overall engagement and acceptability will be greater in the dDPP, and that the superiority of the dDPP on clinical outcomes will be mediated by higher engagement in this arm.  This project will advance chronic disease prevention and behavioral science research by elucidating the extent to which fully-automated digital interventions using artificial intelligence technology can deliver effective, scalable, sustainable, and cost-effective health-promoting behavioral change interventions in high-risk populations. The implications of this fully-automated approach for scalability in diabetes prevention are profound. 2 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, currently affects nearly 1 in 3 Americans, the vast majority of whom do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk for type 2 diabetes. In this project, we propose to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of a fully-automated digital diabetes prevention program for weight reduction, promotion of physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C (a measure of average blood glucose control) compared to standard of care in-person diabetes prevention programs. Since this digital diabetes prevention program uses artificial technology and requires no human component, it would potentially offer a breakthrough in improving population health in a scalable and cost- effective way, helping the tens of millions of affected U.S. patients and hundreds of millions of patients globally living with prediabetes.",Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs,10034797,R01DK125780,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Glucose', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Favorable Clinical Outcome', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior change', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Prevention', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'diabetes prevention program', 'digital', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'interest', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mHealth', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pilot trial', 'population health', 'program costs', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,733116,-0.04245864021876382
"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits. This project aims to combine smartphone and wearable sensor data with machine learning to remotely monitor symptoms during chemotherapy and to develop a system that automatically recommends patient-provider contact when severe symptoms are detected.",A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy,9962316,R37CA242545,"['Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Heart Rate', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Notification', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'chemotherapy', 'common treatment', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'mobile computing', 'multi-site trial', 'novel', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symptom management', 'trial comparing', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2020,361165,-0.008594372759384829
"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,9891936,K01AG061274,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data Set', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Rate', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Internal Medicine', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Price', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Savings', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'asthmatic patient', 'career', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'financial incentive', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'health economics', 'health plan', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'treatment effect']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,K01,2020,130228,0.007085368636814814
"TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial Abstract Adverse outcomes, including death, respiratory failure and renal failure, are common after surgery, and represent a serious public health challenge. Such adverse outcomes can be mitigated through integrated, collaborative health information technology solutions that provide clinicians cognitive and computational support. The chief motivation for the TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial is that a multi-faceted telemedicine solution has the potential to facilitate the dynamic assessment of risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, and implement evidence-based practices. The net result for patients would be improved safety and outcomes. Our telemedicine solution, called the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), encompasses real-time patient data integration from the electronic health record, clinician decision support, machine learning algorithms that predict adverse outcomes, and remote monitoring for the operating room (OR). This conceptualization of sophisticated remote monitoring for the OR is somewhat analogous to an air traffic control tower for a busy airport. The innovative TECTONICS trial will build on a series of preliminary studies (funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the National Science Foundation) that have (i) established the usefulness and usability of a prototype telemedicine ACT; (ii) customized and enhanced decision-support alerts for the ACT, based on clinician user feedback; (iii) designed, developed, and tested machine learning algorithms that predict adverse postoperative outcomes; and (iv) established the feasibility of conducing a real-world randomized trial of the prototype ACT. The TECTONICS trial builds logically on these preliminary studies. Aim 1 is to show that we can implement and sustain an integrated ACT system. As part of this, we will iteratively assess the accuracy of our machine learning algorithms and modify them to improve their ability to predict in real time when patients are at high risk for experiencing negative outcomes. Aim 2 is to understand how the ACT system affects clinicians’ (anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists [CRNAs]) thinking, decision-making and behavior. This understanding will help us to enhance the ACT system, improve workflow processes in the ACT and in the OR, and improve collaborative interactions between anesthesiologists and CRNAs. Aim 3 is to conduct a rigorous clinical trial. We will evaluate the impact of the ACT system on the quality of care in the OR, and clinical outcomes such as intraoperative awareness, and postoperative delirium, renal failure, respiratory failure, and 30-day mortality. TECTONICS will be the first practical and scientifically rigorous trial of a telemedicine solution for the operating room, and will inform the usefulness of incorporating such technology in routine care of surgical patients, including under-resourced healthcare settings. With many millions undergoing surgery yearly, this feasible application of technology could signal a major shift in the safety and quality of perioperative care, and translate into substantial societal gain. Narrative Adverse outcomes, including death, are common after surgery and represent a public health challenge. There is an urgent need to assess the potential usefulness of a remote technology-based control center for the operating room to dynamically assess risk, diagnose negative patient trajectories, implement evidence-based practices, and improve outcomes. This innovative study will rigorously assess whether the implementation of an 'anesthesiology control tower', with sophisticated decision-support tools, improves the care, safety and outcomes of surgical patients.","TECTONICS (Telemedicine Control Tower for the OR: Navigating Information, Care and Safety) trial",9930157,R01NR017916,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Certified registered nurse anesthetist', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Delirium', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enabling Factors', 'Engineering', 'Evidence based practice', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Network-based', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative Care', 'Perioperative complication', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Update', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'postoperative delirium', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'routine care', 'safety outcomes', 'support tools', 'surgery outcome', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'waiver']",NINR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,644350,-0.009034916131182128
"SPEEKO for Elderspeak: A Self-Monitoring App to Improve Communication and Reduce Behavioral Symptoms in Care for Persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias PROJECT ABSTRACT  The growing population of persons with dementia presents challenges to providing high quality nursing home (NH) care. Care is complicated by behavioral and psychosocial symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as aggression, vocal outbursts, wandering, and withdrawal that occur as persons with dementia lose cognitive and communication abilities and cannot verbally express unmet physical and psychosocial needs. NH staff use “elderspeak,” speech similar to baby talk that is demeaning to residents. Residents react to elderspeak with BPSD resulting in increased use of psychotropic medication to control BPSD, higher staffing needs, more staff stress and turnover, and increased costs. The Changing Talk (CHAT) training program educates staff about elderspeak and better communication strategies and is proven to reduce staff elderspeak and BPSD in NH residents. To increase dissemination, this effective classroom-based training has been transformed to online internet modules that improve access for busy staff including those in rural and small NHs and increase ease of dissemination across long term care service settings. To further enhance training effects, SPEEKO for Elderspeak, an automated performance-based app that uses natural language processing has been developed to provide immediate reinforcement of training to staff at the point-of care. This study will build on app proof of concept to establish feasibility of use in the clinical setting and will test preliminary efficacy of the app for augmenting the effect of training on reducing elderspeak communication in dementia care.  This R21 will conduct a clinical trial in response to PAR-18-179; Research on Informal and Formal Caregiving for Alzheimer’s Disease by testing a technology-based, natural language processing app to support caregivers in addressing unique challenges of providing advanced dementia care. We will demonstrate feasibility of use at the point-of-care with five certified nursing assistants, and further validate the app’s accuracy by comparing app outputs reporting diminutive use to results from transcription and psycholinguistic coding. Hypothesized app effects on augmenting reductions in staff elderspeak diminutive use after training will be tested in a cluster randomized trial comparing immediate and delayed feedback with 60 CNAs in 6 nursing homes. If effective in boosting training effects, this readily scalable app can be disseminated across long term care service and support settings to increase communication training effects that will reduce resident BPSD and psychotropic medication use and provide periodic reinforcement for communication training.  The goal is to further improve and sustain effects of communication training in nursing staff that will reduce BPSD and inappropriate use of psychoactive medications. This nonpharmacological approach uses available technology to improve dementia care and aligns with the top priority goal of the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care. As the number of persons diagnosed with dementia triples in the next 30 years, empowering care providers to provide high quality care for individuals with dementia is of critical importance.

"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD. Hence, the identification of patients with early AMD and referral to an ophthalmologist is critically needed to help prevent vision loss. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening and prediction system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of vision loss.",A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration,10010769,R44EY031202,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Antioxidants', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Drusen', 'Ear', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fees', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Java', 'Lasers', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modeling', 'New York', 'Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sales', 'Savings', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Sun Exposure', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Trademark', 'Treatment Cost', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Acuity', 'Vitamins', 'age related', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care costs', 'checkup examination', 'commercial application', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'photobiomodulation', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'retinal imaging', 'rural area', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'software as a service', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NEI,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R44,2020,585067,0.000524237827421149
"Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies). PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Every year Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) adversely affect millions of Americans at a societal cost of more than $200 million.1 Concurrently, half of Americans living with ADRD never receive a diagnosis.2-7 Early detection helps those with ADRD and their caregivers better plan and potentially lessen the burden of lengthy and costly medical care. Current investigational approaches using biomarkers for early detection are invasive, costly, and sometimes inaccessible to patients. The National Institute on Aging calls for the development of effective, scalable and low cost approaches for early detection of ADRD (RFA-AG-20-051). Currently, primary care clinicians provide the majority of care to older adults living with ADRD.1-5 Our interdisciplinary scientific teams have developed and tested scalable early detection approaches.10, 11 We are proposing to evaluate an integrated approach embedded in the Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) that leverages Electronic Health Record systems, machine learning models, and patient reported outcomes to deploy a low- cost and scalable approach for early detection of ADRD. Our proposed studies will leverage previously developed machine learning models (Passive Digital Marker) and patient reported outcomes (Quick Dementia Rating Scale). The design of our proposed studies is predicated on the notion that patient screening is done to identify a more targeted group of referral for applicable diagnostic and management services. We will conduct two complementary multi-site studies to evaluate the effectiveness of two scalable approaches for early detection of ADRD. The first study will be a clinical validation study of the three scalable approaches; the Passive Digital Marker (PDM) that uses EHR data, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) that uses patient reported outcomes (PROs) imbedded within the EHR system, and the combination of both (PDM + QDRS). The second study will be a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial of two screening approaches embedded within the AWV, as compared to the AWV-only process, in increasing the incidence rate of new ADRD. In the final year of the study, we will share our codes for both the Passive Digital Marker and the QDRS with Epic headquarters to ensure that these codes are available for any healthcare system with Epic nationwide. The high costs of treating Alzheimer’s disease and the costs incurred by patients and caregivers, both tangible and intangible, are a major threat to public health and the US economy. Developing scalable and low cost instruments and assessments integrated into EHR data will assist physicians in early detection, more and better diagnoses, and clinically meaningful care recommendations. Cost effective, scalable, and noninvasive models are urgently needed to proactively mitigate these costs and prolonged medical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will consist of two complementary studies at diverse urban, suburban, and rural primary care practices within Central Indiana and South Florida. The first study Aim will evaluate the predictive performance of the Passive Digital Marker, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) using Patient-reported Outcome (PRO) data embedded within the Electronic Health Records, and the combined approach (Passive + QDRS) in the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD), compared to the gold standard of diagnoses. The second study Aim will evaluate the practical utility and effect of the Passive Digital Marker, the QDRS, and the combined methods in improving the annual rate of new documented ADRD diagnosis in primary care practices. The project will compare different approaches to early detection of ADRD, crucial to the endeavors to stop dementia progression; it will also evaluate the low-cost combined methods and integrated approach to overcome current barriers to ADRD detection.",Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies).,10092237,R01AG069765,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease therapeutic', 'American', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical dementia rating scale', 'Code', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quick Test for Liver Function', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'arm', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'early detection biomarkers', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'patient screening', 'response', 'screening', 'societal costs', 'suburb', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2020,1094329,-0.011801084810712764
"Scalable tools to effectively translate genomic discoveries into the clinic PROJECT SUMMARY We are in the midst of a genomic revolution; more than 250,000 human genomes have been sequenced, generating over a petabase of genomic data. While these new data hold great promise to impact health, there is a disconnect between genomic discovery and clinical care. Providers frequently misinterpret genomic information, patients often don't understand their own test results, and genomic information about disease risk is infrequently shared between patients and family members. Importantly, ineffective communication and data misinterpretation has devastating consequences- including unnecessary organ removal, missed disease prevention opportunities, and premature death. We are addressing these genomic care gaps by developing and testing tools that optimize the integration of whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing (WES, WGS) for general clinical practice. My vision for improving genomic medicine is based on my work within multidisciplinary consortia and addresses the National Human Genome Research Institute's priority research area of improving the effectiveness of healthcare. In the proposed work we will test the effectiveness of a multilevel genomic e-Health intervention in cancer (Aim 1). Our intervention 1) educates physicians and patients about genomics, 2) enables direct-to-patient return-of- results, 3) provides physicians with patient-specific results and resources for interpretation, and 4) facilitates sharing of genomic results within families. We hypothesize that intervention use will result in higher rates of uptake of high-quality, genetically guided care. We will test our hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial among academic and community physicians who use WES for their patients. Next, we will use an iterative process, with stakeholder engagement, to adapt and pilot test our tool for Spanish and Mandarin speaking patients and for patients who have diabetes (Aim 2). Finally, we will create and assess new, moderated, social networks as a platform for genomic information sharing (Aim 3). Our hypothesis is that providers, patients and family members will engage with the genomic information sharing social networks and find them to be highly useful. Our general approach includes 1) creating the secure social networks, 2) integrating the networks into our e-Health intervention, and 3) using complementary methods, such as interviews and natural language processing, to assess stakeholders' network-related attitudes and network information quality. If successful, we will be well positioned to widely disseminate our e-Health tools. In sum, this work stands to transform how people obtain, process and share genomic information in the context of clinical care. Our tools reconceive genetic communication to allow for multi-directional flow of information, connects multiple stakeholders with one another, and integrates high-quality dynamic web-based resources to improve genomic care. In creating and deploying tools that both respond to and leverage the complexities of our information environment, we intend to transform genomic research and clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE/ RELEVANCE OF PROJECT TO RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH Widespread utilization of genomic sequencing in medicine creates an urgent need to educate providers and patients. Currently, providers frequently misinterpret genomic information and patients often don't understand their own test results. In order to address this critical need, we propose to design and test multiple e-Health communication tools that will help providers and patients to better understand genomic data, lead to higher quality patient care, and facilitate genomic information sharing within families.",Scalable tools to effectively translate genomic discoveries into the clinic,10003373,R35HG010721,"['Address', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Community Physician', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human Genome', 'Information Networks', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Secure', 'Social Network', 'Sum', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'eHealth', 'effectiveness testing', 'exome', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'online resource', 'premature', 'tool', 'uptake', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE,R35,2020,540906,0.008200861854960606
"Early Mobilization: Operationalizing Big Data & Implementation Science to Lead Expansion to ICUs (E-MOBILE-ICU) PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 800,000 critically ill patients require mechanical ventilation every year and three quarters of the survivors suffer from persistent disability, which poses a major public health problem as critical care becomes more widely utilized and available. Although early mobilization, which engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation, is a promising evidence-based intervention that may prevent disability, less than ten percent of pa- tients ever get out of bed. This proposal aims to apply precision medicine to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from early mobilization and elucidate how it can be implemented successfully to extend the benefits of early mobilization to critical care survivors at greatest risk for long-term disability. I hypothesize that this re- source-intensive intervention can be applied with greater precision to a subset of patients most likely to bene- fit, and that implementation science strategies can be devised to successfully drive adoption of this interven- tion beyond a clinical trial setting. I will test my hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) I will identify the optimal critical illness phenotype for implementation of early mobilization by using cutting-edge machine learning methods; Aim 2) I will determine the effect of early mobilization on long-term functional disability to incentivize adoption of this practice; Aim 3) I will determine the barriers and facilitators of implementation of early mobilization across five institutions to identify the contextual features associated with successful implementation to inform strategies that can bridge the gap between evidence base and clinical practice. My long-term goal is to mitigate the com- plications of critical illness with clinical trials using precision-based methods to identify at-risk and yet apt-to- benefit populations paired with implementation science methodologies to illuminate how to bring these interven- tions to the bedside. To accomplish this, I have assembled an exceptional interdisciplinary team of mentors (Drs. Vineet Arora, Matthew Churpek, and John Kress) and advisors (Drs. Shyam Prabhakaran, Donald Hedeker, Laura Damschroder, and Matthias Eikermann) who have a track record of NIH-funding and successful mentor- ship of post-doctoral candidates. I intend to build on my foundation as an accomplished clinical trialist and have formulated an in-depth career development plan to gain expertise in machine learning methods to identify differ- ential treatment effects (Churpek and Prabhakaran), longitudinal data analysis, (Arora and Hedeker), and imple- mentation science methods (Arora, Prabhakaran, and Damschroder) to craft strategies that bring complex mul- tidisciplinary interventions from clinical trials (Kress and Eikermann) to everyday ICU care. Completion of this proposal will train me to fill an unmet need defined by a recent National Academy of Medicine publication which indicated that identification of differential treatment effects must be paired with rigorous implementation to help transition evidence base to routine clinical care. Equipped with advanced statistical skills and implementation science approaches, I will be able to design hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials to target and implement complex multidisciplinary interventions to vulnerable populations in future R01 level applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Three-quarters of survivors of mechanical ventilation will develop persistent disability. Early mobilization engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation to prevent disability, but has poor adoption into clinical practice.

"Advancing Quality and Outcomes Measurement in Rheumatology PROJECT SUMMARY Healthcare has changed rapidly in the last decade with the widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs) and the creation of national EHR-based data networks that aim to improve the quality of care. The American College of Rheumatology's RISE registry is a federally Qualified Clinical Data Registry that collects EHR data from the practices of almost 1000 rheumatologists nationally, analyzes these data centrally, and continuously feeds back performance on quality measures to practices via a web-based dashboard. In this K24 proposal, the applicant proposes to utilize novel methods in clinical informatics to increase the accuracy of quality measurement, while also developing and testing new EHR-based quality measures relevant to rheumatic diseases. The proposed research will leverage her strong research portfolio, including grants from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, her successful track record of achieving national endorsement for EHR-based quality measures, existing data from over 1.4 million patients in the RISE database, and the outstanding institutional environment at the University of California, San Francisco. It will also support her ongoing career development in clinical informatics methods relevant to EHR-based clinical research. For this five year K24 award proposal, she plans to increase the time spent mentoring junior investigators in the field or quality and outcomes measurement in rheumatology, with the goal of helping trainees successfully launch academic research careers in patient- oriented research. Aligned with a comprehensive mentoring plan, the proposal outlines two specific aims, including using natural language processing to increase the accuracy of EHR-based quality measurement in RISE, and developing and validating new, prototype electronic clinical quality measures to monitor and address high impact gaps in care for patients with rheumatic disease. The work will prioritize outcome measures and use eMeasurement standards, including the Quality Data Model and Health Quality Measures Format to develop, specify and test measures. Measures developed through this research and mentoring program will be candidates for nationwide dissemination across rheumatology practices to improve care for individuals with rheumatic disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This mid-career investigator award will support a program in patient-oriented research in rheumatic diseases at the University of California, San Francisco. The award will allow the applicant to expand her research on the development and validation of health care quality measures and support her mentoring of early investigators. The proposed research aims to create quality measures that can be deployed across rheumatology practices to improve the quality of care, while training new researchers to perform innovative patient-oriented research in the area of electronic health record-based quality and outcomes measurement.",Advancing Quality and Outcomes Measurement in Rheumatology,9873905,K24AR074534,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Feeds', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Osteoporosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Preventive care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'dashboard', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'data standards', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning progression', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient registry', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research study', 'rheumatologist', 'structured data', 'success', 'tool']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2020,189666,-0.006583017821997427
"iDAPT: Implementation and Informatics - Developing Adaptable Processes and Technologies for Cancer Control PROJECT SUMMARY iDAPT Implementation and Informatics - Developing Adaptable Processes and Technologies for Cancer Control is a developing center with an emerging theme on the use of technologies to support rapid cycle and real time deployment and testing of implementation processes and adaptations within cancer control. The Administrative Core will manage the Center, ensure that iDAPT is engaged with “real world” clinical partners, patients, and families, is well-networked with the Implementation Science Centers in Cancer Control consortium, and engage in a comprehensive evaluation of Center activities and milestones. The Research Program will include an Implementation Studies Unit with an initial 2-year pilot study using adaptable technology to enhance shared decision-making in survivorship care planning for survivors of breast cancer. The Research Program also includes a Methods Unit with an initial innovation pilot study to test the feasibility of natural language processing to measure communication patterns pre-implementation and to monitor implementation fidelity of programs designed to enhance within-team and clinical team-to-patient electronic communication. The Research Program is expected to complete 8 to 10 pilot studies. In order to foster research aligned with iDAPT’s theme, we will build and sustain iDAPT’s Implementation Laboratory which incorporates capacity building and infrastructure for testing the use of technologies to support rapid cycle and real time deployment of implementation processes and adaptations within cancer control. The laboratory includes primary care and oncology clinics in our local “Hubs” in southern Appalachia (North Carolina) and the northeast (Massachusetts) and “Spokes” including over 900 community-based oncology clinics in the NCIs National Community Oncology Research Program and nationwide Veteran’s Administration clinics. iDAPTs leadership is a multi-disciplinary team of experts with extensive experience in cancer-focused implementation science, behavioral science, computer engineering and computer science, clinical informatics, formative qualitative methods, epidemiology, and biostatistics. The iDAPT Developing Center will be considered successful if we achieve the following outcomes: (1) a robust, collaborative Implementation Laboratory with partners who are knowledgeable and experienced with implementation science in cancer control; (2) completion of 8 to 10 pilot projects related to iDAPTs emerging theme; (3) pilot grantees and lab partners are prepared to lead investigator initiated studies as a result of capacity building and pilot grant experiences; (4) junior faculty and underrepresented persons are engaged in all Center activities; (5) The field of implementation science in cancer control is advanced aligned within iDAPT’s emerging theme; and (6) iDAPT is part of a new network of ISCCCs who collectively build the field of implementation science in cancer control.

"Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness PROJECT SUMMARY Access to mental health specialists is difficult for many patients in the U.S., particularly for the poor and those who live in rural communities. Telemental health is one potential solution for this access problem, and there has been rapid growth in the number of live video-based telemental health visits in the U.S. While there are numerous rigorous randomized-control trials comparing telemental health visits to in-person mental health specialist care, there have been little research on how telemental health is being used in real-world settings. The uptake of telemental health has been very uneven geographically, and what explains this variation is also largely unknown. Our mixed-methods proposal centers on filling these gaps in knowledge. Under the first aim, we will conduct a series of descriptive analyses of data on 75 million adults with Medicare or commercial insurance to understand how telemental health is being used in conjunction with in-person care and whether the growth of telemental health has decreased disparities in the use of mental health specialists among disadvantaged populations. Under the second aim, we seek to explain why there is geographic variation in uptake using robust statistical machine learning. Under the third aim, we exploit the variation in uptake to assess whether communities with greater telemental health penetration have experienced improvements in care for patients with mental illness. In the fourth aim we will conduct qualitative interviews with providers to complement the empirical analyses and understand the key contextual factors underlying our findings. Understanding how telemental health is being used, why there is variation in use of telemental health, and whether telemental health use is associated with higher quality care could help drive future telemental health interventions and influence the ongoing policy debate on telemedicine regulations and reimbursement. Together the results of these aims are consistent with the NIMH's expressed interest in innovative delivery models that can improve care for underserved communities. It is difficult for many patients with mental illness to access care from a mental health specialist. Telemental health is one way to potentially help these patients receive care and the number of such visits for mental illness has increased rapidly. In this project, we will study how telemental health is being used to care for patients with mental illness, what drives variation in use, and whether telemedicine is associated with receipt of higher quality care.",Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness,9821740,R01MH112829,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diffusion', 'Disabled Persons', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Telemedicine', 'Telemental', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care costs', 'contextual factors', 'control trial', 'demographics', 'design', 'disadvantaged population', 'experience', 'geographic difference', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'older patient', 'population health', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'rapid growth', 'rural area', 'severe mental illness', 'statistical and machine learning', 'symposium', 'trend', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,709065,0.023547067012283932
"A Telehealth Advance Care Planning Intervention for COVID-19 in New York City The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has highlighted the importance of advance care planning (ACP) for older patients who are most at risk of dying, and a critical need exists to optimize this process. ACP empowers patients to express their values and goals for care before they become too ill to do so. ACP also prepares patients, and their families, to make difficult decisions in real time when the moment arises. For older patients, COVID-19 may result in respiratory failure and high mortality rates. However, many older patients may prefer to avoid these interventions, especially if the mortality rate is high and death is experienced alone in the hospital without family nearby. Motivated by the disproportionate risk to older patients from COVID-19 and the higher mortality rates, primary care clinicians should engage all older patients with ACP to ensure their preferences are known and honored. Unfortunately, many clinicians have not been trained in ACP and patients are unfamiliar with it.  To address this gap, we have developed a Comprehensive Telehealth ACP Program for COVID-19 that implements ACP routinely into medical care and responds to the present need for virtual communication. The ACP Program combines two well-tested, evidence-based, and complementary interventions: online clinician communication skills training and ACP patient video decision aids. The overall objective of this application is to reduce the burden of COVID-19 and its consequences for an aging US population that may prefer to forgo aggressive potentially ineffective interventions, and to die outside of the hospital setting. To accomplish this, we propose to conduct a Pre-Post trial using an open cohort design of a telehealth ACP Program among older patients in the nation's COVID-19 epicenter, New York. We will train 250 primary care clinicians caring for 25,000 diverse patients over the age of 65 from the largest health care system in New York (Northwell Health). We will use Natural Language Processing to abstract our outcomes from the electronic health records for patients. We hypothesize that a telehealth ACP Program of clinician serious illness communication skills training combined with ACP videos will improve and sustain rates of ACP from the time that the intervention is implemented compared to the time prior to the intervention.  Clinician communication training and video decision support is a practical, evidence-based, and innovative approach to uniformly provide robust ACP. Major strengths of this proposal are: the highly experienced team making this project feasible; the present infrastructure already embedded at Northwell Health, which has the largest number of COVID-19 patients in the US; and, the potential immediate deployment of the intervention, if successful, across the country. This work holds the promise of improving the quality of care provided to millions of Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has dramatically shown the need for advance care planning (ACP) by older patients who are most at risk of dying, and there is a critical need to optimize this process. Communication skills training for clinicians and patient-facing video decision aids have shown promising efficacy for improving patient-clinician communication, increasing ACP documentation, and leading to more patient-centered care. This proposal seeks to assess the effectiveness of a Comprehensive Telehealth ACP Program for increasing documented ACP conversations, improving clarification of resuscitation preferences', and enhancing palliative care and hospice utilization in 25,000 patients at Northwell Health, the largest health care system in New York and the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.",A Telehealth Advance Care Planning Intervention for COVID-19 in New York City,10170786,UH3AG060626,"['Address', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Aging', 'American', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Communication', 'Consultations', 'Country', 'Critical Illness', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Family', 'Feeling', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intubation', 'Life', 'Loneliness', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Resuscitation', 'Resuscitation Orders', 'Risk', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'acute care', 'cohort', 'comparison intervention', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'hospice environment', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'loved ones', 'mortality', 'novel coronavirus', 'older patient', 'pandemic disease', 'patient health information', 'patient-clinician communication', 'pragmatic trial', 'preference', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'skills training', 'success', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIA,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,UH3,2020,2405961,0.006187396341364305
"Implementing a digitally-enabled community health worker intervention for patients with heart failure Project Summary/Abstract Heart failure (HF) 30-day readmissions generate over a third of HF healthcare costs in the US and are the leading cause of US 30-day readmissions. Drivers of HF readmissions include increasing complexity associated with clinical, social, and behavioral factors. Despite numerous interventions, readmission rates remain elevated and a quarter of these could be prevented by a multidisciplinary approach promoting better connections to and communication with clinical care teams while addressing social and behavioral barriers to HF care. Community health workers (CHWs) are members of medical teams who address social, behavioral, and basic clinical factors influencing health outcomes while fostering patient connections to and communication with care teams. CHW care is one of a few interventions shown to reduce readmissions in patients with chronic disease. However, CHW care relies on intensive 1:1 patient care models that do not leverage technology which limits efficiency and scalability. There has been limited attention on developing technology-based interventions in CHW care to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. A HF mobile phone application-based digital platform that utilizes artificial intelligence driven biometric data to minimize false alarms, promotes early identification of true decline, and encourages communication with providers was developed in 2016 to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. Preliminary clinical trial data for the digital platform has been promising. A prototype designed for patients with HF and the CHWs caring for them has recently been created. The current proposal will assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. Aim 1: Identify behavioral (e.g., diet, activity) and social (e.g., socioeconomic status, social supports, living situation) factors that influence HF outcomes relevant to a digitally-enabled CHW intervention by performing semi-structured interviews with 30 patients with HF and 20 CHWs. Aim 2: Test usability of a digitally- enabled CHW intervention (focused on CHW workflow integration) in 10 patients with HF in an open pilot trial. Aim 3: Assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of implementing a digitally-enabled CHW intervention compared to CHW care to reduce HF 30-day readmissions within a pilot RCT (n=50). The candidate’s overall career goals are: to identify social and behavioral drivers of HF/cardiovascular clinical outcomes; to develop expertise in qualitative methods, behavioral science, and RCTs; and ultimately, to develop interventions that improve care and reduce costs in HF/cardiovascular disease and other NHLBI diseases seen by generalists. This training plan includes strong mentorship, formal coursework, and scientific meetings with cohesive training in behavioral and social sciences, qualitative research, and the conduction of RCTs. This proposal investigates a potentially transformative intervention that addresses important gaps in the literature by assessing the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention in reducing 30-day readmissions and improving patient engagement. Project Narrative: Despite ongoing efforts to improve outcomes in heart failure (HF), a leading cause of mortality and elevated healthcare costs, 30-day HF readmission rates remain elevated and a quarter of these are preventable. Community health worker (CHW) care delivery has been shown to improve healthcare outcomes but inefficiency limits its scalability. Implementation of a 30-day digitally-enabled CHW intervention for HF patients may provide support for similar interventions in larger HF/cardiovascular populations by reducing 30-day readmissions and improving patient engagement.",Implementing a digitally-enabled community health worker intervention for patients with heart failure,9871771,K23HL150287,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Community Health Aides', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Research', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Team', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Singapore', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavioral/social science', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinical care', 'cohesion', 'comorbidity', 'comparison intervention', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'health difference', 'hospital readmission', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient engagement', 'pilot trial', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'readmission rates', 'social', 'social factors', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2020,197243,0.0022781244049818296
"Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP) 1. Abstract We propose to create a NIMH P50 ALACRITY Center that develops the collaborations, data systems, and methods necessary to form a state-wide Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research, aka the LEAP Center. While recent trial evidence suggests great promise for coordinated specialty care (CSC) for patients with first episode psychosis (FEP), there remain several gaps in the knowledge base for the care of psychosis in general. Now is an ideal time to address these gaps because of recent policy changes enhancing FEP care financing, practice changes in the field, and methods developed outside of mental health. To create this Center, we will start with interdisciplinary collaborations between CSC clinics in Massachusetts, policy makers/regulators, and stakeholders, and include FEP experts from across the country plus scientific experts from outside of mental health, e.g., in data science, machine learning, epidemiology, and health policy. We also will leverage recent Massachusetts efforts to mandate, standardized, and support data collection on FEP care structures, delivery, and outcomes from all FEP clinics within the state. We also will apply and develop modern methods for clinical prediction and comparative effectiveness research (CER), e.g., machine learning and g-methods, for FEP research. Accordingly, we have three overall Center aims: 1) Collaborations; 2) Data systems; and 3) Prediction and CER methods. The Center will start with three foundational and complementary projects: 1) Using the state All Payer Claims Database (APCD), Project 1 will apply a population-level approach to examine which patients receive care in FEP clinics offering CSC versus elsewhere, as the number of clinics increases, then estimate the treatment effect on unfavorable clinical event rates such as hospitalizations; 2) Project 2 will review the data collected by the state from all of the FEP clinics, assess and improve data collection quality, validate measures, and integrate perspectives; and 3) Project 3 will define clusters of patients using longitudinal outcome data (i.e., begin to unpack the amount of clinical heterogeneity), predict the cluster type for individual patients, and examine the impact of CSC treatment accounting for this clinical heterogeneity. The Administrative Core and Methods Core (Prediction and CER) bind these projects together. The Center will include a group of Scientific Advisors from across North America, Center Faculty from diverse scientific disciplines, including those that historically have had little exposure in mental health research, and Stakeholders, including policy makers, organizational decision makers, and patient and family advocates. All three groups will be deeply involved in the Center from design to dissemination. The overall goal is to create a state-wide learning health system for early psychosis. This effort to create the protocols and apply the methods necessary to convert large amounts of data into useful clinical and policy knowledge will inform other national efforts, e.g., NIMH’s EPINET. Project Narrative Psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are common illnesses with serious, negative effects on patients and families; fortunately, recent studies suggest that early coordinated treatment might help mitigate some of these adverse effects. There remain many questions, however, about the disease course and treatment options, including what treatments will work best for which patients. This Center will be dedicated to addressing these questions by bringing together leading clinicians and scientists, and creating the systems needed to conduct studies to provide guidance to patients, families, and clinicians in the future.",Laboratory for Early Psychosis Research (LEAP),9928111,P50MH115846,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adverse effects', 'Advocate', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Community Outreach', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education and Outreach', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Information Systems', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'North America', 'Operations Research', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'data harmonization', 'data quality', 'design', 'faculty community', 'first episode psychosis', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'treatment effect', 'web site']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,P50,2020,1704908,0.006538485325896068
"DAT- Implementing routine screening for cannabis and other drug use disorders in primary care: impact on diagnosis and treatment in a randomized pragmatic trial in 22 clinics PROJECT SUMMARY DAT18-06 The personal, social, and public health burdens of substance use disorders (SUDs) in the United States have been compounded by the opioid epidemic and legalization of recreational and medical cannabis use. Traditionally, healthcare systems have referred patients with SUDs to specialists. Although SUD treatment is associated with improved outcomes, most people with SUDs remain unidentified and untreated. The magnitude of unmet need has led experts to recommend incorporating screening and assessment for SUDs into routine primary care (PC), to increase rates of diagnosis and treatment of SUDs. Despite extensive observational research, to our knowledge no randomized controlled trial has evaluated the impact of PC-based programs of screening and assessment on new SUD treatment. The proposed study takes advantage of a unique and fortuitous opportunity to evaluate the impact of a PC program of screening and assessment for SUDs on new diagnosis and treatment of SUDs. The Sustained Patient-centered Alcohol Related Care (SPARC) trial, completed in July 2018, was a rigorously-designed randomized implementation trial testing a multifaceted approach to improving care for unhealthy alcohol use. However, at the request of clinical leaders at Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) where the SPARC program was implemented, routine screening and assessment for opioid, cannabis, and other drug use disorders (CUD, OUD, and DUD, respectively) were added before the trial was launched in 22 KPWA PC clinics. As a result, the SPARC trial's implementation program—consisting of practice coaching, electronic health record (EHR) support, performance monitoring and feedback, and provider training—also targeted SUDs. Data from health system monitoring reports indicate the trial achieved high, sustained rates of screening for SUDs, exceeding the target of 80% of patients with PC visits. However, the SPARC trial was only funded to evaluate alcohol-related outcomes. The proposed study will rigorously evaluate the SPARC program's impact on the clinically meaningful primary outcome of new SUD treatment within 90 days of a primary care visit (Aim 1). To illuminate potential continued gaps in the quality of SUD care (Aim 2), we will use natural language processing (NLP) to extract and quantify reasons why: 1) patients reporting ≥4 DSM-5 symptoms of SUDs do not receive formal coded diagnoses of OUD, CUD, or DUD, and 2) why patients with newly diagnosed OUDs, CUDs, and DUDs do not received treatment. Most people with OUDs, CUDs, and other DUDs are never treated. An estimated 2.5-3.9% of US adults have past-year SUDs, and nearly 90% report no SUD treatment. Yet >84% of US adults have outpatient visits annually, and over half of these visits are in PC. If the proposed innovative study demonstrates that screening and assessment in PC increase SUD treatment, it would provide support for a widely endorsed yet previously untested approach to addressing a critically important gap in the quality of care for SUDs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Drug use disorders associated with unhealthy opioid, cannabis, and other drug use are major public health concerns but most people with these disorders remain untreated. Experts recommend systematic screening and assessment in primary care as a way to improve SUD treatment, but the effectiveness of such programs is unknown. This study rigorously evaluates such a program through an opportunity created when screening and assessment for drug use disorders were unexpectedly added to a randomized, stepped wedge, 22-clinic trial originally planned to focus exclusively on alcohol use disorders.",DAT- Implementing routine screening for cannabis and other drug use disorders in primary care: impact on diagnosis and treatment in a randomized pragmatic trial in 22 clinics,9884229,R01DA047312,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohols', 'Cannabis', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Medical', 'Medical Marijuana', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Observational Study', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preventive screening', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Shame', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'brief intervention', 'care providers', 'design', 'disability', 'health data', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'implementation trial', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'marijuana use', 'neglect', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use', 'patient oriented', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'social', 'social stigma', 'therapy design']",NIDA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,323000,-0.03757404946364201
"STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias (ADRD) are debilitating conditions affecting more than 5 million Americans in 2014. It is projected that 8.4 million people with be diagnosed with ADRD over the next 15 years and health care costs attributable to ADRD are projected to be more than $1.2 trillion by 2050. Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) are common and often involve aggressive behavior towards family caregivers (CG) in response to unmet needs, discomfort, or frustration. BPSD frequently lead to CG seeking medication to control patient symptoms. Antipsychotic use in persons with dementia (PWD) more than doubles mortality risk. The Choosing Wisely Guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association and American Geriatrics Society both recommend against prescribing antipsychotics as a first-line treatment for BPSD. Behavioral interventions such as STAR-Caregivers are efficacious first-line treatments for managing BPSD endorsed by the Administration on Aging. However, the programs have not been implemented widely – partly due to the intensity/cost of the programs and difficulty conducting outreach. No study has investigated CG willingness to reduce or discontinue antipsychotic use. We propose a Stage III clinical trial to ascertain the feasibility and acceptability of STAR Virtual Training and Follow-up (STAR- VTF) in which (a) training materials are delivered electronically and learning is self-directed, (b) caregivers have two in-home visits with a social worker and (c) where caregivers receive support from a social worker via secure messaging (email) within a web-based portal. We will compare outcomes in the STAR-VTF group to an attention control group (mailed material plus generic secure messages). Our specific aims are: (1) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of STAR-VTF to caregivers; (2) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the program from the payer perspective; and (3) Test the hypotheses that (H1) caregiver participants in STAR-VTF will have lower levels of caregiver burden at 8 weeks and 6 months compared to an attention control group; and (H2) PWD participants in STAR-VTF will have lower rates of daily antipsychotic medication use at 6 months compared to attention control. We propose to recruit 100 CG-PWD dyads (50 in each arm). This will be the first study to test a low intensity, self-directed caregiver training program with secure message support from social workers. It will also be the first study to measure changes in antipsychotic medication use by PWD after CG training. The study is also innovative because it brings together leading experts in caregiver training, health information management, and care management. Third, this will be the first study to use automated data and natural language processing to identify potential caregivers in need of education/support at a time when antipsychotic medication use begins. Results of this study will inform a future multi-site trial in the Mental Health Research Network. NARRATIVE Our study evaluates the effectiveness of a caregiver outreach, training, and support program for caregivers of people with dementia who are using antipsychotic medication to manage agitation/aggression. We will conduct a randomized trial of the caregiver program compared to a control group to measure differences in caregiver burden and discontinuation of antipsychotic medication use. The results will help in expanding access to and delivery of empirically supported behavioral health services for caregivers and people with dementia.",STAR Caregivers - Virtual Training and Follow-up,9930511,R01AG061926,"['Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'American Psychiatric Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'E-learning', 'Education', 'Electronic Mail', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Family Caregiver', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Home visitation', 'Improve Access', 'Information Management', 'Integrated Delivery Systems', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Program Acceptability', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self-Direction', 'Site', 'Social Workers', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Training Support', 'Training and Education', 'Travel', 'Washington', 'arm', 'attentional control', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'caregiver depression', 'caregiver education', 'cost', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multi-site trial', 'outreach', 'payment', 'pragmatic trial', 'program costs', 'programs', 'psychological symptom', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'response', 'retiree', 'secondary outcome', 'time use', 'urgent care', 'virtual', 'web portal', 'willingness']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,531691,0.01966515596395859
"Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI) Project Summary/Abstract  Substance misuse is inconsistently addressed in routine medical practice. Primary care physicians frequently fail to diagnose substance abuse when presented with early symptoms of alcohol or drug use. Patients report that less than one-third of primary care physicians carefully screen them for substance abuse, in spite of available and effective screening protocols. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an integrated, evidence-based approach aimed at delivering early intervention for drug and alcohol misuse in medical settings and has been demonstrated to reduce substance misuse. Motivational Interviewing (MI), an underlying component of SBIRT, is an evidence-based, brief interventional approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors. Unfortunately, the MI approach is very difficult to teach to practitioners as it is counterintuitive to most providers who commonly take a directive approach with patients. Because of ineffective training, MI and SBIRT are under-utilized.  The primary goal of this project is to transform MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that analyzes practitioner responses and gives immediate feedback to improve MI skills. Our team has been developing and testing a training tool that uses natural language processing (NLP) to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI). ReadMI is a low cost, ultra-portable solution for accurate and automatic real-time assessment of dialog during the course of MI training. It makes use of the latest advances in deep-learning-based speech recognition and mobile and cloud computing technologies to enable instantaneous MI training assessment and analysis. Currently functioning with 92% accuracy, ReadMI provides immediate feedback to MI and SBIRT trainees regarding the number of open- and closed-ended questions asked, provider-vs-patient conversation time, and other integral components of MI.  ReadMI will advance the skill development of physicians and other healthcare professionals in their use of MI and SBIRT, minimizing the need for time-consuming reviews of recorded training sessions. Our aims are: 1) develop ReadMI to provide MI training metrics with 95% accuracy and 2) test ReadMI in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 200 medical students and residents, 100 who will receive SBIRT/MI training with ReadMI and 100 who will serve as the control group, receiving customary SBIRT/MI training.  The prospective applications of ReadMI extend far beyond substance use disorder (SUD) prevention, detection, and intervention. The effectiveness of all chronic disease management is largely dependent on patient behavior. MI is a patient-focused conversation between the provider and the patient that reinforces the patient's motivation to make positive changes in health-related behavior. By making efficient MI training available to more health professionals, ReadMI will improve healthcare quality as providers are better equipped in their efforts to help patients make healthy lifestyle changes. Project Narrative Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors, including substance misuse. However, MI and a specific application of MI to substance misuse known as SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) are underutilized because of inadequate training of health professionals. This research aims to revolutionize MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that uses natural language processing to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI).",Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI),9980343,R21HS026548,[' '],AHRQ,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,118134,-0.05414876428474275
"Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Behavioral obesity treatment produces clinically significant weight loss and reduced disease risk/severity for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease. Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes, which can be largely attributed to lapses from the recommended diet. Our work has shown that dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals) are frequent during weight loss attempts (~3-4 times per week), associated with poorer weight losses, and triggered by momentary changing states (e.g., changes in mood or availability of palatable food). Thus, there is a clear need for innovative solutions that can provide dynamic in-the-moment interventions to improve adherence to the prescribed diet in obesity treatment. Our research team was the first to develop a smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) that includes: 1) daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling via mobile device) of relevant behavioral, psychological, and environmental triggers for lapse; 2) a machine learning algorithm that uses information gathered via EMA to determine real-time lapse risk; & 3) delivery of brief intervention during high-risk moments. Our pilot work revealed that the JITAI was feasible, acceptable, and produced reductions in average lapse frequency. However, we have not yet shown a direct effect of the JITAI on eating behavior in the moment of heightened lapse risk and know little about the types of interventions that are most effective for reducing lapse. We therefore propose to extend our research via a micro- randomized trial (MRT), a methodology that involves random assignment to intervention (or control) at a specific decision point, i.e., when our algorithm predicts heightened risk for a lapse. The MRT will determine whether a specific intervention in a specific moment had its intended effect. We will therefore port our JITAI to a more scalable online platform and conduct a MRT to evaluate the effects of a generic lapse risk alert message and theory-driven just-in-time interventions on dietary lapses. After refinement testing with n=15 to ensure proper technical functioning of our updated JITAI, adults with overweight/obesity (n=159) will participate in a well-established 12-week online obesity treatment program + JITAI, with 12 weeks of JITAI-only follow-up. When an individual is at risk for lapsing s/he will be randomized to no intervention, a generic risk alert, or one of 4 theory-driven interventions with interactive skills training. The outcome of interest will be the occurrence (or lack thereof) of dietary lapse, as measured both subjectively (i.e., via EMA) and objectively (i.e., via wrist- based intake monitoring), in the hours following randomization. Results of the MRT will inform an optimized algorithm for intervention delivery that will drive the finalized JITAI. A future RCT will compare weight loss in obesity treatment with and without the optimized JITAI. This highly innovative approach will advance the science of adherence by supporting the development of sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior and informing JITAIs that target adherence to other health behaviors (e.g., medication, activity goals). PROJECT NARRATIVE This project targets dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals), a major cause of poor outcomes during behavioral obesity treatment, which is recommended as a first-line intervention for cardiovascular disease. We propose to conduct a micro-randomized trial to empirically optimize a just-in-time adaptive intervention that monitors risk and intervenes on lapses as needed. By evaluating the immediate, proximal effect of four theory-driven interventions on lapse behavior, the project will: (a) produce a scalable, finalized JITAI that has the greatest potential to show clear clinical impact in future RCTs and pragmatic trials; and (b) inform the development of more sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior more broadly.",Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial,10029156,R01HL153543,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Education', 'Energy Intake', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health behavior', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Palate', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychological Factors', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Severities', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavioral adherence', 'brief intervention', 'clinically significant', 'dietary adherence', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'pilot trial', 'pragmatic trial', 'prediction algorithm', 'psychologic', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'skills training', 'theories', 'treatment program']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2020,727923,-0.0047153085114123704
"The Utah-Cohort Of Postnatally persistent Antenatal Hydronephrosis (U-COPAH) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate for this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award aims to become an international leader in the development, dissemination, and implementation of novel health care interventions and management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis that is diagnosed in utero but that persists after birth, or postnatally persistent hydronephrosis (PNH). The proposed mentored research and career development plan lays the foundation for this career and the eventual development of a standardized management strategy for PNH by generating the evidence needed to support its development and creating an ultrasound (U/S) grading tool needed to implement it in routine clinical practice. Kidney U/Ss are the main test to monitor PNH, but U/S reports are heterogeneously formatted and contain synonymous and ambiguous terms that complicate their interpretation. Another major obstacle in the field is a need to predict those at risk for worsening disease and to better understand the natural history of PNH. Aim 1 will develop a Natural Language Processing algorithm to automatically translate free-text U/S reports into structured data providing the PNH grade. Aim 2 will use baseline U/S and renal scan data to predict the PNH grade at 2 years. Aim 3 will use growth curves to simulate PNH’s natural history and provide the time and frequency of disease resolution/improvement, stability, and progression. The candidate brings to this proposal experience as a pediatric urological surgeon at a large tertiary care children’s hospital and core research skills in epidemiology and biostatistics. An integral part of his career development will be a continued relationship with an outstanding multidisciplinary mentoring team with complementary strengths. The candidate’s primary mentor is Rachel Hess, MD, MS. Dr. Hess is a world renown expert in implementing interventions in routine clinical care and has an exemplary track record of mentorship. Flory Nkoy, MD, MS, MPH, the candidate’s co-mentor, is an expert in bioinformatics and internationally recognized for developing, disseminating, and implementing pioneering approaches to treat chronic disease in children. Advisors include Jeffrey Ferraro, PhD, and Wendy Chapman, PhD (bioinformatics), Angela Presson, PhD (biostatistics), Patrick Cartwright, MD (pediatric urology), and Mark Ebert, MD (pediatric radiology). The proposed research and training plan will establish the candidate’s solid foundation in bioinformatics, augment his prior epidemiology and biostatistics training, and provide extraordinary training in dissemination and implementation science. This will provide him with the skills and experience necessary for a career as a successful independent researcher focused on developing, implementing, and disseminating novel management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Hydronephrosis diagnosed in utero but persisting after birth (PNH) affects tens of thousands of infants each year in the United States, but its management is complicated by ambiguous reporting of hydronephrosis severity and a relatively limited understanding of predictors of disease outcome and knowledge of the disease’s natural history. The proposed research uses the largest known pediatric hydronephrosis cohort to develop a tool to translates free-text ultrasound reports into coded PNH grades, predict the 2-year outcome using 3-month baseline data, and apply sophisticated modeling techniques to simulate the disease’s natural history.

"CPS: AutoWean: Foundations of Autonomous Medical CPS for Mechanical Ventilation Weaning   While mechanical ventilators provide life-saving respiratory support, prolonged acute mechanical ventilation (PAMV) can lead to severe complications (e.g. , pneumonia) and increased healthcare costs - predicted to be over $32 billion in 2020 and accounting for over 10% of all hospital costs. Thus, mechanical ventilation needs to be discontinued as early as possible, often by using a process known as ""weaning"". However, the best approach to weaning remains an open question and is subject to controversy, where estimated 170,000 preventable deaths per year in US intensive care units are a result of inappropriate ventilator weaning. Consequently, the Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) lists improper ventilator settings as a Top 10 Health Technology Hazard in 2019.  Autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning exemplifies a medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) that requires collections of interconnected medical devices (e.g., ventilators and patient monitors) that are coordinated for treating a patient (i.e. , performing safe autonomous weaning). This proposal aims to develop fundamental advances in safe and effective data-driven context-aware human-in-the-loop control that will enable autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning . While closed-loop control and data-driven techniques (e.g., system identification and machine learning) have been applied to MCPS, assuring the safety and reliability of using data-driven components that adapt in-the-loop with a human operator remains a challenge. We will demonstrate the impact of our closed-loop design and analysis techniques in autonomous MCPS for mechanical ventilation weaning .  The proposed project directly aligns with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) through the research and development of new technologies to advance medical care through medical device interoperability and clinical decision support for enabling autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning. Also relevant to the NIBIB mission, achieving the aims of this project requires a multidisciplinary approach and complementary advances in computer science and clinical care. From the healthcare perspective, this project will offer evidence-based and personalized decision support to caregivers for better mechanical ventilation weaning. The long-term impact of autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning pain will lead to shorter hospital stays, reduce the economic burden of health care, and reduce the deadly side effects of inappropriate weaning. This project concerns development of technologies to quantify and enable autonomous mechanical ventilation weaning , where, currently, the best approach to weaning remains an open question and is subject to controversy.

"Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases PROJECT SUMMARY The over-arching aim of this research is to: improve understanding of the patterns of health care utilization and associated costs of physical elder abuse victims to improve early identification and intervention and to inform policy. In our prior research, supported by an NIA GEMSSTAR and Beeson grant to PI Dr. Rosen, we leveraged unique partnerships with prosecutors’ offices to comprehensively examine legal case files from more than 200 victims in two large metropolitan areas, representing the largest retrospective series of legally adjudicated physical elder abuse cases ever examined. For the proposed study, we plan to link these cases, for which we have done extensive clinical analysis, to Medicare claims data. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) To use Medicare claims to describe rates and patterns of health care utilization of victims before and after detection, with a focus on potentially missed opportunities by health professionals to identify abuse and differences based on victim characteristics, (2) To compare rates and patterns of ED visits and hospitalizations of physical elder abuse victims to control groups selected algorithmically from Medicare claims data, and (3) To compare patterns of health care utilization other than EDs/hospitals between victims and controls. The proposed research will provide important insight into the patterns of health care utilization for physical elder abuse victims, focusing on whether missed opportunities exist and suggestive patterns emerge. We plan to employ sophisticated machine learning approaches to increase our ability to identify patterns suggestive of physical elder abuse exposure. This will inform strategies for identification and intervention by health care providers, and knowledge gleaned will support the future development of a health informatics tool to identify potential victims. Findings on associated costs will help define the scope and impact of physical elder abuse. This innovative approach leverages existing data gathered with NIA support and extrapolates from successful research approaches in child abuse and intimate partner violence while expanding on them. As no additional subjects will be prospectively enrolled as part of this research, we avoid many of the ethical concerns typical in elder mistreatment work. Our multi-disciplinary team of experts in elder abuse, child abuse and neglect, intimate partner violence, and emergency medicine as well as specialists in statistics, health economics, and computer science is uniquely able to conduct this research. Previously, we have done seminal work examining health care usage and health-related outcomes of elder abuse victims by linking adult protective services and police databases to health care data, which is highly relevant for this proposal. We also have deep experience in using Medicare claims data and machine learning for research. The long-term goal of our research is to leverage a better understanding of health care use by elder abuse victims to improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to help this vulnerable population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Elder abuse can have serious health consequences, but little is known about the patterns of their health care utilization. We propose to comprehensively examine the health care utilization and associated costs from known physical elder abuse cases using Medicare claims data. Findings from this research will improve the ability of health care providers to identify, intervene, and prevent victimization and to inform policy changes to reduce costs and help this vulnerable population.",Identifying Patterns of Health Care Utilization among Physical Elder Abuse Victims Using Medicare Data and Legally Adjudicated Cases,9930430,R01AG060086,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Case Series', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Clinical', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Elder Abuse', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Departments', 'Hospitalization', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Methodology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Victimization', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abuse victim', 'adjudicate', 'aged', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'convict', 'cost', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'health economics', 'hospital utilization', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intimate partner violence', 'legal cases', 'maxillofacial', 'medication compliance', 'member', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'perpetrators', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'statistics']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,384234,0.017856949397241712
"A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) is expected to triple by 2050, contributing to decreased quality of life, increased medical care utilization, and additional burden on an already stressed primary care system. Many clinicians lack confidence to assess, diagnose and manage cognitive impairment (CI), and more than 50% of patients with CI are undiagnosed. Unfortunately, studies show that even in settings with high rates of standardized CI screening, very few patients who screen positive have documentation of any clinician follow-up action. To address these important problems, in phase 1 (R61) of this project, we will develop and validate a machine learning model (called MC-PLUS) using results from brief Mini- Cog (MC) screens completed routinely at Annual Medicare Wellness exams and electronic health record (EHR) data to identify patients at elevated risk of a future dementia diagnosis (AD/ADRD). We will also develop and validate a web-based and EHR-integrated CI clinical decision support (CI-CDS) system to engage patients and clinicians in conversation about elevated dementia risk, and to give clinicians the confidence and tools they need to diagnose and manage CI. Both MC-PLUS and the CI-CDS system will be added into an existing web-based CDS platform that has high use rates and primary care clinician satisfaction, and is already seamlessly integrated within the EHR. This CDS platform improves outcomes for patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and high cardiovascular risk as shown in published studies. We will systematically validate the CI-CDS system with expert champions prior to conducting a pilot test at one primary care clinic. After milestones for success are demonstrated, we will begin phase 2 (R33), a large pragmatic trial with 30 primary care clinics randomized to receive CI-CDS or usual care (UC). We will evaluate change in clinician confidence in CI detection and care management in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. If successful, the CI-CDS system will improve rates of new CI diagnosis and narrow existing sociodemographic disparities in adults with elevated dementia risk identified by MC-PLUS at index visit in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. We will evaluate the impact of the intervention on care management and care plans using EHR data and chart audits. We will assess determinants of clinician actions in response to the CDS system using behavior change theory and technology acceptance constructs, and conduct phone surveys of patient and caregiver dyads to evaluate intervention effects on feelings of preparedness for decision making and distress. The CI-CDS system is immediately scalable to large numbers of patients through the existing non-commercialized CDS platform already in use for millions of patients in care systems spanning 14 states. The CDS system implemented as described could maximize return on massive investments that have been made in EHR systems, and provide a prototype to rapidly and consistently translate evolving evidence-based CI guidelines into personalized CI care and guidance within primary care. Project Narrative Most experts advocate for early detection of cognitive impairment (CI) so that patients and caregivers can be prepared for making difficult decisions and to improve quality of life, but studies show that screening alone isn’t sufficient to change clinician actions related to early detection. Using predictive modelling developed with machine learning methods and sophisticated clinical decision support (CDS) tools, it is possible to identify patients at elevated risk for CI and make it much easier for primary care to engage and support patients and caregivers in meaningful care planning. In this project, we implement and evaluate a low-cost, highly scalable CI-CDS system integrated within the electronic health record that has high potential to improve early CI detection and care and translate massive public and private sector investments in health informatics into tangible health benefits for large numbers of people.",A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment,10092423,R61AG069770,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Expenditures', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Office Visits', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Printing', 'Private Sector', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Public Sector', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Suggestion', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Theory of Change', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care systems', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'personalized care', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual']",NIA,HEALTHPARTNERS INSTITUTE,R61,2020,592048,0.00036626468168776574
"Mobile app delivered Mentalizing Imagery Therapy to augment remote family dementia caregiver skills training: a pilot randomized, controlled trial with outcomes assessment using digital phenotyping Over 15 million Americans serve as family caregivers of relatives with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD- Related Dementias (ADRD), and this often subjects them to tremendous stress, resulting in poorer mental health and higher risk of physical illness. Due to emotional and physical exhaustion, lack of time, and immediate needs related to caring for their loved ones, caregivers often forego their own self-care. The National Institute on Aging Strategic Plan identifies the need to develop better interventions to improve the mental and physical health of caregivers as a crucial priority area. The purpose of this Paul B. Beeson K76 Emerging Leaders Career Development Award in Aging Research application is to support the research training of Dr. Felipe Jain, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Jain’s work aims to improve caregiver skills training delivered remotely by smartphone with guided imagery and mindfulness therapies that reduce stress and help the caregiver improve mentalizing (understanding the links between mind and behavior) of themselves, their loved one suffering from dementia and others in their social milieu. Further, Dr. Jain hopes to develop the skills in machine learning and data science necessary to estimate early changes in caregiver symptoms remotely and passively, without any additional effort on the part of the caregiver who is often already overwhelmed, using smartphone sensors that capture information about caregiver behaviors.  In the conduct of this K76 award, Dr. Jain will lead a randomized, controlled trial for 120 AD/ADRD caregivers 60 years of age or older. Caregivers will be assigned to receive smartphone applications that either include a caregiver skills toolbox alone, or a caregiver skills toolbox combined with Mentalizing Imagery Therapy (MIT). MIT uses guided imagery and mindfulness to help caregivers improve stress, reduce negative mood and increase mentalizing. Theoretically, stress reduction resulting from MIT due both to mindfulness skills and better mentalizing of the care recipient and others should help caregivers better implement tools for caregiving within their unique social environment and accounting for the care recipient’s individual symptoms.  The first aim of the study is to determine the clinical effects of App-delivered caregiver skills with or without MIT on caregivers’ perceived stress, caregiver burden, mastery, depression and insomnia. The second aim is to develop behavioral markers from smartphone sensors that are associated with outcomes. We will (1) test the hypothesis that smartphone estimated sleep is longitudinally associated with caregivers’ self-reported insomnia, stress and burden and (2) determine the feasibility of identifying behavioral features with machine learning to predict day-to-day sleep and stress. If successful, this research will help open a new avenue of AD/ADRD caregiver research and treatment focused on improving mentalizing. It will also inform the field of aging research regarding the feasibility of using smartphone sensors to detect changes in early behavioral markers that may be used by clinicians to intervene for older adults at risk of poor outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed research will promote the public health of more than 15 million Americans who serve as family caregivers for relatives with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. It will assess whether stress reduction therapy incorporating guided imagery practices that promote perspective taking and empathy can improve the effects of family caregiver skills training delivered remotely by smartphone. It will also test the feasibility of using smartphone estimated markers to track caregiver insomnia and stress, which could eventually help reduce caregiver suffering and healthcare costs by identifying early warning signs of treatment failure and symptomatic worsening.","Mobile app delivered Mentalizing Imagery Therapy to augment remote family dementia caregiver skills training: a pilot randomized, controlled trial with outcomes assessment using digital phenotyping",10045735,K76AG064390,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic stress', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Emotional Stress', 'Empathy', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Friends', 'Guided imagery', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Mindfulness Training', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self Care', 'Sleep', 'Sleeplessness', 'Social Environment', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'care giving burden', 'care recipients', 'caregiver depression', 'caregiving', 'clinical effect', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'exhaustion', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'loved ones', 'medical schools', 'mental imagery', 'mindfulness', 'mobile application', 'multimodality', 'negative mood', 'novel therapeutics', 'perceived stress', 'physical conditioning', 'predict clinical outcome', 'primary caregiver', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychological symptom', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'skills', 'skills training', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'stress reduction', 'tool']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K76,2020,213157,-0.009333105710054091
"NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health SUMMARY/ABSTRACT NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health – Overall Health outcomes are affected by myriad mechanisms, including behaviors. An important question is how such behaviors might be influenced in ways that improve health outcomes on a broad population-wide scale. The NBER Roybal Center explores this question by conducting carefully-designed experimental interventions with analytic and theoretical foundations in the behavioral sciences. The interventions are selected to be cost- effective and scalable. Among the categories of health-related behavior we plan to study are interventions to improve nutrition; interventions to increase exercise; interventions to overcome addiction, including tobacco, alcohol, and opioids; interventions to promote preventive care, including vaccinations and incremental utilization of workplace wellness programs; interventions to improve medical adherence, including the filling of pharmaceutical prescriptions; and interventions to improve the decisions of health care providers, including applications of machine learning. The research plan is strengthened by a partnership with Geisinger Clinic, a non-profit health care network and insurer with a rich history of innovative delivery reforms and experimental research to improve population health in an active, well-integrated, health care delivery and community health setting. The NBER-Geisinger partnership provides a core infrastructure for implementing experimental interventions on-site with an engaged and committed health care delivery partner. The Center also engages a collaborative network of leading behavioral scientists from multiple disciplines who conduct the experimental interventions, share research activities and findings, collaborate on joint projects, and brainstorm new intervention opportunities, building from findings in basic science. This application renews the NBER Roybal Center for the next five years. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Health is a foundational source of wellbeing for people of all ages. As resilient as human physiology may be, and as random and unexpected as health events may be to any particular person at any particular time, health is also affected by the lifestyle decisions that we make, our behavioral interactions with the medical care system, and how we respond to adverse health events when they occur. The NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health will take research from basic science and translate it into applications that address real-world problems in ways that directly, broadly, and cost-effectively improve population health.",NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health,10017809,P30AG034532,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohols', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Factors', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Health', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Discipline', 'Economics', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Experimental Designs', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Natural experiment', 'Onset of illness', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Vaccination', 'Wellness Program', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior influence', 'care systems', 'career life balance', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'exercise intervention', 'experimental study', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'meetings', 'nutrition', 'outreach', 'population health', 'programs', 'provider networks', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'synergism']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P30,2020,531220,0.010274691801851634
"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,10009334,R21EB027852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Car Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Fall prevention', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social Psychology', 'Statistical Models', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive load', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'medical attention', 'mobile application', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'standard measure', 'treadmill', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2020,229404,-0.007833395971953282
"BAsIC - Brain-computer-interface practical Application in the Intensive Care unit: a pilot study Patients increasingly survive critical care, but for many the experience is psychologically tormenting in part because they lose all control over their environment. Patients with neurological injury in particular suffer from this major loss of autonomy which impacts their long term recovery. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology transforms physiological changes associated with patient thoughts into actionable outputs. The technology is rapidly advancing and well established outside of the critical care setting. The goal of this project is to determine whether conscious and unconscious appearing ICU patients are able to communicate their basic needs, such as pain, hunger, and thirst, to health care providers using the BCI technology. We will apply a bedside BCI system in the ICU using a machine-learning algorithm that analyzes changes in routine EEG in response to standardized questions presented to the patient by headphones. The BCI system will provide immediate closed- loop feedback (auditory and/or visual) to patients about their performance. To achieve our goals, we will first test if conscious ICU patients are able to express basic needs, such as pain, to health care providers using the BCI technology. Patients will trigger the BCI system to then express their needs in response to specific questions (e.g., “Do you have pain?”). Secondly, we will determine whether basic communication is possible for patients with cognitive motor dissociation (i.e., patients who appear unconscious, but follow commands using EEG motor imagery paradigms). We will test if these patients are able to use the BCI system to respond to simple questions (i.e., “Activate the alarm”). Finally, we will assess the patient's experience using BCI technology as part of this study, as well as acceptance of using BCI technology in future clinical trials from patients, families, and health care providers involved in the study. The long-term goal of this proposal is to prepare a large clinical trial to test the benefits of BCI-assisted communication in brain-injured ICU patients. Patients in critical care suffer an almost complete loss of control over their most basic needs (e.g., they are unable to tell someone that they are hungry), which is stressful and impacts their long term recovery.

"Ethical, Legal and Social Implications in the Use of Digital Technology for Mental Health Applications Digital mental health technology (DMHT) –digital devices (smartphones, sensors) that can monitor and collect personal data from patients (tracking location/voice/motion, self-report), apply algorithms and machine learning (“ML”) to generate and integrate health and risk information (from genomics/family history), and even mediate care (monitoring treatment adherence or chatbot therapy)– is being integrated into mental health clinical care, with the goal of improving access, diagnostics and treatment for mental illness.

"Using the Electronic Health Record to Identify and Promote Goals-of-Care Communication for Older Patients with Serious Illness Although discussions that address patients' goals of care are one of the most important aspects of palliative care, this communication is often lacking in our healthcare system. Goals-of-care communication is associated with improved patient and family outcomes and reduced intensity of care at the end of life. Electronic health records (EHR) provide a key opportunity to identify patients who would benefit from these discussions and to promote these discussions, yet prior interventions have not used the EHR for this purpose.  Older adults with chronic illness, and particularly those with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), are especially vulnerable to inappropriately intensive end-of-life care. To address this shortcoming, we build on two of our most successful programs, one using the EHR to identify goals-of-care discussions and the other a novel intervention called Jumpstart that promotes and enhances these discussions. We will examine the effectiveness of the Jumpstart intervention for hospitalized older adults with chronic illness and specifically oversample those with ADRD to understand the effectiveness of the intervention in this key group.  We propose 2 linked, complementary randomized trials. Trial 1, a pragmatic trial, compares usual care with a clinician-facing Jumpstart for hospitalized older adults with serious illness (n=2000). Trial 2, a comparative effectiveness trial, compares this clinician-facing Jumpstart with a bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart based on surveys completed by patients or family members (n=400). We hypothesize that the clinician-facing Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to usual care, and the bi-directional, patient- specific Jumpstart will improve outcomes compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart. We use an innovative hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach to accomplish 3 aims. Aim 1 evaluates the effectiveness of the clinician-facing Jumpstart, compared with usual care, for improving quality of care; the primary outcome is EHR documentation of a goals-of-care discussion during the hospitalization. Secondary outcomes include intensity of care at the end of life. Aim 2 evaluates the effectiveness of the bi-directional, patient-specific Jumpstart compared to the clinician-facing Jumpstart; the primary outcome is the same as Trial 1. We will examine the same secondary outcomes, but also include patient- and family-reported outcomes assessed by surveys at 1 and 3 months after randomization including occurrence and quality of goals-of-care communication in the hospital, goal-concordant care, psychological symptoms, quality of life, and palliative care needs. We will also examine costs of care after accounting for costs of the interventions. In Aim 3, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation to explore barriers and facilitators to future implementation and dissemination.  Our team has experience conducting innovative multi-center trials with patient-centered outcomes, economic analyses, and implementation science. This novel hybrid effectiveness-implementation approach addresses key knowledge gaps to improve the quality and value of care for older adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Communication about goals of care is one of the most important aspects of palliative care for older adults, yet the lack of this communication is a major shortcoming in our healthcare system. We propose 2 linked and innovative randomized trials to evaluate a novel intervention that promotes and enhances goals-of-care discussions for hospitalized patients with serious chronic illness.

"Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management Abstract  The study will develop more accurate, computational predictive models and a novel automatic explanation function to better identify patients likely to benefit most from care management. For many chronic diseases, a small portion of patients with high vulnerabilities, severe disease, or great barriers to care consume most healthcare resources and costs. To improve outcomes and resource use, many healthcare systems use predictive models to prospectively identify high-risk patients and enroll them in care management to implement tailored care plans. For maximal benefit from costly care management with limited service capacity, only patients at the highest risk should be enrolled. But, current patient identification approaches have two limitations: 1) Low prediction accuracy causes misclassification, wasted costs, and suboptimal care. If an existing model  were used for care management allocation, enrollment would miss >50% of those who would benefit most  but include others unlikely to benefit. A healthcare system often has insufficient data for model training and  incomplete data on many patients. A typical model uses only a few risk factors for adverse outcomes, despite  many being known. Also, many predictive variables on patient and system characteristics are not found yet. 2) No explanation of the reasons for a prediction causes poor adoption of the prediction and busy care  managers to spend extra time and miss suitable interventions. Care managers need to understand why a  patient is predicted to be at high risk before allocating to care management and forming a tailored care plan.  Existing models rarely give such explanation, forcing care managers to do detailed patient chart reviews.  To address the limitations and optimize care management for more high-risk patients to receive appropriate care, the study will: a) improve accuracy of computationally identifying high-risk patients and assess potential impact on outcomes; b) automate explanation of computational prediction results and assess impact on model accuracy and outcomes; c) assess automatic explanations' impact on care managers' acceptance of the predictions and perceived care plan quality. The use case will be asthma that affects 9% of Americans and incurs 439,000 hospitalizations, 1.8 million emergency room visits, and $56 billion in cost annually. Asthma experts and computer scientists will use data from three leading healthcare systems; a novel, model-based transfer learning technique needing no other system's raw data; a novel, pattern-based automatic explanation technique that also improves model generalizability and accuracy; a new data source PreManage to make patient data more complete; and novel features on patient and system characteristics. These techniques can advance clinical machine learning for various applications, improve patient identification, and help form tailored care plans. Focus groups will be conducted with clinicians to explore generalizing the techniques to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and heart diseases, on whom care management is also needed. The results will potentially transform care management for better outcomes and more efficient resource use. Narrative  Care management is widely used in managing asthma patients. The proposed new techniques will boost the performance of patient identification and care plan development for care management, leading to improved clinical outcomes and more efficient healthcare resource use.",Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management,9982399,R01HL142503,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Air', 'American', 'Asthma', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drops', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weather', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'asthmatic patient', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'care costs', 'computer science', 'cost', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'simulation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,792540,0.024341287913115656
"Individual differences in dementia spousal caregiver burden: A biobehavioral approach revision Abstract The outbreak of SARS-Cov-2 virus has exasperated the vulnerability of dementia spousal caregivers, as well as those with Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias. SARS-Cov-2 is a highly contagious virus that can cause severe respiratory problems and even death. Older adults and people of all ages with underlying comorbidities are considered to be at “high-risk” for severe illness from COVID-19. During this pandemic, dementia spousal caregivers are tasked with the burden of keeping their spouse safe from getting sick and even dying from COVID- 19, while simultaneously performing their typical caregiving responsibilities. The vast majority of dementia spousal caregivers and their spouses with dementia are over sixty-five years of age, the age bracket that puts people at most risk for COVID-19 disease complications and mortality. Social distancing guidelines make up a large proportion of the current prevention recommendations; thus, loneliness and other negative emotions will likely be frequent and more intense than usual. The proposed competitive revision builds upon the primary aims of the parent grant (R01AG062690) by using attachment theory as an overarching theoretical framework to understand dementia spousal caregiver risk and resilience in light of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 disease). The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PA-18-935, NOT-AG-20-022. Capitalizing on the dementia spousal caregivers who will take part in the parent study, we propose to collect additional data for one week each month for three months. We will collect this data using ecological momentary assessment methods, while passively assessing location, activity, autonomic activity, and sleep via smartphone and smartwatch technology. We aim to understand how emotions, assessed in real-time in the natural environment, affect the extent to which AD spousal caregivers adaptively navigate the challenges associated COVID-19. We will also aim to determine how relatively stable individual difference patterns that originate from people’s close relationship histories (i.e., attachment orientations) inform risk and resilience. As an exploratory high risk/high reward aim, we will evaluate if dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches can incorporate passively collected information (i.e., location, heart rate, heart rate variability, activity, sleep) with information that we learn from our primary aims, to yield a detailed and sophisticated understanding of real-world dynamics that predict three critical COVID-19 specific outcomes: social distancing adherence, social distancing self-efficacy, and caregiver self-efficacy. By understanding patterns of risk and resilience, intervention scientists will be better able to identify at-risk AD spousal caregivers. The proposed research would advance our understanding of how AD spousal caregivers can reduce illness exposure for themselves and those they care for in perhaps the most comprehensive, detailed, real-time, real-world investigation of social distancing in AD spousal caregivers to date. Narrative By identifying the factors that impede social distancing behaviors and impair a dementia spousal caregiver’s confidence to provide care, we will be able to design tailored and targeted interventions to reduce risk of COVID- 19 contagion, and improve quality of life for dementia spousal caregivers.",Individual differences in dementia spousal caregiver burden: A biobehavioral approach revision,10201213,R01AG062690,"['2019-nCoV', '5 year old', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'COVID-19', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elderly', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Foundations', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Homeostasis', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Location', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Efficacy', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Social Distance', 'Social Environment', 'Spouse Caregiver', 'Spouses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Virus', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'comorbidity', 'contagion', 'contextual factors', 'design', 'foot', 'heart rate variability', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'interest', 'mortality', 'pandemic disease', 'parent grant', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'risk prediction model', 'smart watch', 'social', 'theories']",NIA,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,493162,-0.049855948340610655
"Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury Abstract Care partners of persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often required to assume a caregiver role, bearing primary responsibility for assisting the person with TBI in physical, mental, financial, and leisure activities. As a result of these new caregiving responsibilities, it is common for these care partners to report problems with physical, mental, and social health, as well as compromised health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Given that care partners’ well-being and functioning affects both their own personal health outcomes, as well as the functional and rehabilitation outcomes of the person with TBI, there is a critical need to develop novel health management interventions to ensure better health outcomes for both members of the TBI care partnership dyad. Therefore, our long-term goal is to improve the health and well-being of these care partners, as well as their ability to provide care to their loved one. Thus, the proposed randomized control trial will examine the efficacy of a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI), or personalized self-management intervention that uses objective mobile sensor data feedback to improve physical activity, sleep, and HRQOL in 240 care partners of persons with TBI. Our primary objectives are to: 1) assess the efficacy of this novel personalized self-management intervention (i.e., JITAI) for preventing the development of adverse symptoms (e.g., mobility, sleep, poor HRQOL); and 2) use data collected from wearables (i.e., the Fitbit Charge®) and real-time assessments of HRQOL to identify care partners with the greatest risk for negative physical and mental HRQOL outcomes, as well as the timing for when they are at greatest risk. We expect care partners that are randomized to receive the JITAI will demonstrate improvements in HRQOL, physical activity and sleep relative to controls. We also hypothesize is that objective, data-derived mobile phenotypes can predict risk for adverse caregiver HRQOL. The scientific premise for the proposed research is based on our multidisciplinary team with expertise in caregiver research, evaluation of HRQOL using patient-reported outcomes, clinical trials implementation, expertise in real time assessment of HRQOL, as well as the statistical expertise in high- dimensional statistics and machine learning. Furthermore, the innovation is grounded in the examination of a real-time, real-world, personalized and scalable JITAI designed to improve HRQOL in care partners. Ultimately, this study will allow us to identify care partners at the greatest risk for negative physical and mental health outcomes, and will provide important efficacy data to support the clinical utility of a low cost, low burden self-management intervention to improve HRQOL for care partners of persons with TBI. Narrative Care partners of persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often faced with considerable physical and emotional stress resulting from their caregiver role; not surprisingly, this stress is associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes for both the care partner and the person for whom they provide care. Given this, interventions focused on improving the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of these care partners will likely have positive downstream effects for the care recipient. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a personalized self-management intervention designed to promote care partner self-care; this intervention uses physical activity and sleep data collected using a Fitbit® and real-time self-reports of HRQOL collected via a mobile phone app, to provide care partners with personalized feedback via app alert four times per week.",Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury,9886675,R01NR013658,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Beds', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caregiver research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Emotional Stress', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Financial Activity', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Leisure Activities', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'care recipients', 'care systems', 'caregiver strain', 'caregiving', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'fitbit', 'functional outcomes', 'group intervention', 'health assessment', 'health management', 'health related quality of life', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loved ones', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'post intervention', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'sensor', 'sleep health', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'tv watching']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,669305,0.002226050546666754
"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population This application extends a long-running NBER program project on the health and wellbeing of an aging population. Our research plan focuses on better understanding health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and the effective use of health care resources to improve outcomes for an aging population in an evolving landscape. Project 1 (Case and Deaton) explores variations in health trends across geography, race and ethnicity, education, and cohort, identifying and analyzing the life circumstances of those whose health and wellbeing have worsened. Project 2 (Maestas) focuses on the increasing prevalence of pain and opioid use, and their relationship to health outcomes, work, and disability program enrollment. Project 3 (Duflo) analyzes the rapid rise in chronic disease in aging, poorer populations (focusing on India), and the potential role of public policy interventions in improving health in a global context. Project 4 (Baicker and Obermeyer) applies machine learning tools to administrative data to identify overuse (reflecting care with little health benefit relative to its cost or risks) and underuse (reflecting missed opportunities for health benefits) of medical services, focusing on the case of diagnostic testing. Project 5 (Kolstad and Handel) analyzes the impact of information technology in physician treatment decisions, and the potential health benefits of expanded use of IT in health care. Project 6 (Chandra and Sacarny) looks at how information about provider quality affects patients' decisions about their medical care, and whether information on quality improves health care market performance through competition. Project 7 (Baicker and Finkelstein) looks at the effect of public health insurance on health care and outcomes for poor adults, using a randomized controlled design enabled by Oregon's health insurance lottery. Project 8 (Williams) looks at policies that stimulate or impede research and innovation in medicine, and the degree to which the “new uses” problem results in underinvestment in innovations with a potentially positive social value. The program project leverages synergies in methods, data sources, and health issues addressed, building on common themes of health trends and disparities, the role of information for patients and providers, and the potential for different policies to improve health. This research has particular importance in the context of societal changes in demographics, population health, health policy, health care organization, and medicine. The program project will also continue to serve as the organizational foundation for a much larger community of scholars engaged in health-related research at the NBER, attracting some of the most talented scientists from each new generation of economists to the study of health issues. Linking this community to health researchers in other disciplines, particularly in medical and clinical fields, is an important new aim of the program, fostering the cross-disciplinary approaches needed to tackle the most pressing health issues facing an aging population. PROJECT NARRATIVE – PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of the program project is to better understand health trends and disparities, the determinants of health, and approaches to improving health in an evolving landscape. It does this through eight component research projects on health and health care, and three cores that coordinate, integrate and leverage the program as a whole. Key themes are understanding recent trends in health and morbility, the disparities in health care and health across the population, the role of patient and provider information, and the potential for different policies to improve health outcomes.",Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population,9990638,P01AG005842,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health trends', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Market', 'Income', 'India', 'Information Technology', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Obesity', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Public Policy', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Social Values', 'Suicide', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'aging population', 'care outcomes', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data access', 'data archive', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'health care disparity', 'health care service organization', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'opioid use', 'population health', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'public health relevance', 'randomized controlled design', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,P01,2020,1744950,0.02605239415365435
"MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS Co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (COD) are common in the United States and providers have been challenged to provide effective treatments. As a consequence, their clients with COD may experience poor treatment engagement, symptom exacerbation and cycle in and out of emergency services. This is particularly true for underrepresented populations with a COD including individuals whom are homeless and involved in the criminally justice system. Research shows that integrated and coordinated community- based services for COD can improve client outcomes. However, healthcare workforce has a gap in training staff on such treatment techniques, which we aim to close via this Phase II STTR project.  Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach and Networking (MISSION) is a unique evidence-based, trans-disciplinary treatment designed to address the complex needs of individuals with CODs and includes manuals for high risk populations of civilian and veteran homeless individuals as well as those involved in the criminally justice system. Listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration-Registry for Evidence Based Practices (NREPP), MISSION has had substantial impact. The Veterans Health Administration has deployed it in their national plan to end Veteran Homelessness. Massachusetts has used it in its Statewide Plan to End Homelessness and written it into Public Law for delivery alongside Veterans Treatment courts. While MISSION is a manualized treatment, a recent multisite implementation study identified the need for more comprehensive training tools. With NIAAA support, the University of Massachusetts Medical School (MISSION developers) partnered with Praxis on a Phase I STTR to (1) develop the MISSION University online training platform, (2) show proof of concept by implementing two training modules and an e-simulation case study, and (3) conduct a pilot randomized trial which demonstrated that training-as-usual Distance Learning (DL) + Technical Assistance (TA) outperformed TA alone.  In Phase II, we will complete MISSION U by developing and testing five new MISSION modules and companion e-simulations tools that test knowledge acquisition and application. We will first do a formative evaluation with 20 learners who will provide feedback on MISSION U modules. This will be followed by a randomized controlled trial similar to Phase I in which 60 learners will be randomized to the DL or the DL+TA conditions. In preparation for future scalability, we will uniquely conduct a qualitative process evaluation using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance framework with 42 MISSION U participants to look at facilitators and barriers to implementation. Lastly, we will pilot test machine learning techniques with our 60 individuals who participated in the randomized trial in an effort to help personalize the MISSION U training experience for commercialization. !1 “MISSION U: A Multimedia Training Tool for Treatment of Individuals with Co-occurring Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders” is aimed at training providers of services for these individuals.

"A Longitudinal Examination to Predict Quality of Life and Care Transitions for Persons with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias at End-of-Life ABSTRACT  Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are a group of progressive, terminal illnesses that will affect an estimated 14-million people in the United States by the year 2050. Caregivers experience chronic stress and they report feeling burdened and unprepared for making difficult end-of-life (EOL) care decisions, which may lead to unnecessary hospitalizations or avoidable transitions in care that affect end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL). Advance care planning (ACP), which improves EOL-QOL, is the gold-standard approach for improving concordance between preferences and actual care received at EOL. However, despite decades of research aimed at raising their rates, only 50% of those with AD/ADRD have a written ACP. Furthermore, there is a lack of current research evidence investigating the factors associated with transitions in care and EOL-QOL for persons with AD/ADRD, which could help guide EOL decision-making. To date, the state of the science is primarily cross-sectional in nature, and does not account for the influence of trajectories of decline, the effect these changes have on caregivers, nor how longitudinal changes in caregiving ultimately affect EOL care outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need to discover new approaches for preparing persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers in making informed, in-the-moment decisions, to ensure high EOL-QOL care and to support appropriate transitions in care as circumstances change over time. Using the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) and National Study on Caregiving (NSOC), we plan to use a machine learning based framework to identify the key determinants for predicting the risk for EOL care transitions and the traits of EOL-QOL among older adults residing in the community. This study has two specific aims: 1) Develop predictive model of factors related to end-of-life care transitions (e.g. inpatient death versus hospice) in persons with AD/ADRD longitudinally; and 2) Develop a predictive model of factors related to end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL) in persons with AD/ADRD. Discovering knowledge in a large population- level dataset is foundational for the future development of a generalizable/scalable model for guiding persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers as they navigate a fragmented healthcare system while making difficult decisions for their loved ones. Our approach fills a critical gap between the current approaches for improving EOL-QOL and EOL transitions in care that focus on ACP as a singular outcome, by addressing the comprehensive needs of individuals with AD/ADRD and their caregivers that change over time. Our study will provide a predictive model for EOL-QOL and EOL care transitions. This is a critical first step for the future development of an approach for personalizing care to guide persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers in making EOL care decisions. These results will have an important positive impact on EOL care, which aligns with the strategic goals of the National Institutes of Aging (NIA) and Nursing Research (NINR) to address clinical and translational gaps in the study of EOL care needs of people with AD/ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are at high risk for experiencing burdensome care transitions, avoidable hospitalizations, and poor end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL) due to the increasing prevalence of multiple chronic illness and escalating demands placed on caregivers, resulting in significant personal and public socioeconomic burdens. Decades of research has focused on improving the rates of advance care plans above 50% among persons with AD/ADRD, however, others may benefit more from personalized guidance to help navigate the trajectory of decline that supports timely, “in the moment” medical decision making. This study addresses Goals 2 and 3 of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease to enhance care quality and efficiency and expand support for persons with AD/ADRD by identifying factors related to poor EOL-QOL and care transitions in the context of caregiving for the future development of a personalized approach to support in the moment healthcare decision-making.",A Longitudinal Examination to Predict Quality of Life and Care Transitions for Persons with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias at End-of-Life,9958923,R03AG067159,"['Address', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family Caregiver', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospice Care', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Nursing Research', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Terminal Disease', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States', 'Update', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'caregiver strain', 'caregiving', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'inpatient service', 'loved ones', 'novel strategies', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'secondary analysis', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'trait', 'trend']",NIA,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R03,2020,79750,0.0013444576029680772
"Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial. Nearly half of people currently living with dementia have not received a diagnosis, delaying access to treatment as well as education and support for the patient and family. Thus, NIA has requested applications to support pragmatic clinical trials of low-cost tools to improve detection of cognitive decline in clinical settings (RFA-AG- 20-051). With pilot funding from NIA, we used machine learning to develop a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule), which uses easily accessible information in the electronic health record (EHR) to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. In addition, we interviewed patients, caregivers, clinicians, and healthcare system leaders to inform pragmatic implementation of eRADAR in clinical settings. Stakeholders felt strongly that such a tool should be implemented through primary care, in the context of existing clinical relationships, and would need to be accompanied by additional support for patients and clinicians. Our current proposal is heavily informed by this development work. In Aim 1, we will use EHR data to evaluate eRADAR's performance in different patient subgroups, including by race/ethnicity, in two healthcare systems to inform selection of cut- points for use in clinical settings. We will select an optimal cut-point to use for targeted dementia assessment with stakeholder input, balancing sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. In Aim 2, we will perform a pragmatic clinical trial to determine whether implementing eRADAR as part of a supported outreach process to high-risk patients improves dementia detection. The setting will be primary care clinics within Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA), an integrated healthcare delivery system in Washington State, and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), an urban, academic healthcare system with a diverse patient population. The study includes 6 clinics with ~24,000 patients age ≥65. Within each clinic, primary care providers (PCPs) will be randomly assigned to have their patients with high eRADAR scores targeted for outreach (intervention) or to usual care (control). Our clinical research staff—whose roles were designed to reflect existing roles within these healthcare systems to maximize pragmatism—will reach out to patients with high eRADAR scores, conduct an assessment for cognitive impairment, make follow-up recommendations to PCPs, and support patients after diagnosis. Patients with high eRADAR scores in both treatment arms will be followed to determine the impact of eRADAR on new diagnoses of dementia (primary outcome) as assessed from the EHR (again, to maximize pragmatism). In Aim 3, we will explore the impact of eRADAR implementation on secondary outcomes including healthcare utilization and experience of patients and family members. If this pragmatic trial is successful, the eRADAR tool and process could be spread to other healthcare systems, potentially improving detection of cognitive decline, patient care, and quality of life. Most patients with cognitive impairment are diagnosed relatively late in the disease process, and about half of people living with dementia are undiagnosed. We have developed a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule) that uses information in electronic health records to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. This study will determine whether a supported process of reaching out to patients with high eRADAR scores as part of primary care leads to earlier detection of dementia and improves patient care.","Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial.",10091300,R01AG069734,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'California', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inpatients', 'Integrated Delivery of Health Care', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Design', 'Research Support', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Underweight', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'comparison intervention', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'outreach', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'usual care arm']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,650000,-0.02680966056080448
"Using Information Technology to Improve Outcomes for Children Living with Cancer This application plans to develop a program, Symptom Monitoring & Systematic Assessment and Reporting System in Young Survivors (SyMon-SAYS), to enable timely mitigation and management of unrelieved symptoms for children with cancer. The SyMon-SAYS will administer, score, interpret and display the results of symptom assessments in “real-time” between clinic visits in cancer care ambulatory settings, when patients are likely to be more symptomatic. We hypothesize that this system can facilitate prompt identification of problematic symptoms; consequently, with the availability of graphical symptom reports over time, timely providers’ clinical care, and an informative symptom management booklet, patients will become informed about their condition and take an active role in treatment, which will further improve self-management skills. Better self-management promotes adherence to treatment plans, builds individual capacity, improves interaction between patients and caregivers, reduces the use of medical specialists, and optimizes clinical outcomes across the lifespan throughout the treatment and disease continua. The proposed waitlist control randomized trial is based on our preliminary study testing the feasibility of the patient-centered SyMon-SAYS in a pediatric oncology clinic. Results showed that the SyMon-SAYS was acceptable to patients/parents and they were willing to use it during their routine clinical care. Clinicians expressed interest in receiving reports yet preferred to review them in the medical record. Based on what we learned from this pilot, we now propose to integrate the SyMon-SAYS system into the electronic health record (EHR), to streamline the alert notification with clinician workflow by using EHR (Epic) messaging, and to include a broader range of symptoms. Patients and parents will complete the weekly symptom assessment and review the symptom report by logging into the Epic MyChart patient portal. Instead of using a standalone SyMon-SAYS app, we will align the SyMon-SAYS program with the Epic EHR. We plan to conduct a single institution modified waitlist control randomized trial of 200 children (ages 8-17) with cancer over 16 weeks (Group A: 16-week SyMon-SAYS intervention; Group B: 8-week usual care and then 8-week SyMon-SAYS intervention) to achieve the following specific aims: 1) evaluate effectiveness of SyMon-SAYS at week-8 and its maintenance effects at week-16. We hypothesize that Group A (versus Group B) will report decreased parent-perceived barriers to managing their children’s symptoms, decreased patient symptom burden, increased patient and parent self-efficacy, and ultimately increased patient HRQOL at week-8 and no significant differences between Groups A & B at week-16; 2) evaluate influential factors to Aim 1, including contextual patient and parent factors, adherence to the SyMon- SAYS intervention, and symptom communication; and 3) evaluate predictors of adherence to the SyMon-SAYS intervention and preference of SyMon-SAYS versus usual care. Project Narrative This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the Symptom Monitoring & Systematic Assessment and Reporting System in Young Survivors program (SyMon-SAYS) for children with cancer in decreasing patients’ symptom burden, decreasing parent-perceived barriers in managing their child’s symptoms, increasing patients’ and parents’ self-efficacy and increasing patients’ quality of life.

"Adaptation and pilot implementation of a validated, electronic real time clinical decision support tool for care of Pneumonia patients in 12 Utah Urgent Care Centers Project Summary Clinicians’ ability to accurately diagnose pneumonia and choose appropriate treatment is enhanced by well- designed clinical decision support (CDS), thereby increasing patient safety. Pneumonia CDS has historically been focused on inpatient settings, but ambulatory care settings with high pneumonia patient volumes and different care processes also need CDS. We propose to adapt and evaluate an innovative, validated electronic clinical decision support (CDS) tool based on consensus guidelines for pneumonia (ePNa) to urgent care centers (UCC). The proposal supports four aims: 1) Adapt ePNa for UCC and after in silico testing, pilot it among “super user” clinicians during UCC shifts and assess its usability. ePNa needs adaptation for the limited patient data available in UCC, calibration of severity measures for lower observed mortality, and a chest imaging prompt in patients with pneumonia signs and symptoms. ePNa for UCC will incorporate the artificial intelligence CheXpert model to provide real-time (within seconds) electronic classification of chest images for elements of pneumonia diagnosis and treatment (radiographic pneumonia, single vs multiple lobes, and pleural effusion). 2) Use the CFIR framework, a focus group of UCC clinicians, and workflow observations to identify barriers and facilitators to adaptation and implementation of ePNa to UCC. 3) Test the implementation strategy by deploying ePNa at one of two randomly chosen Intermountain Healthcare UCC clusters each with about 800 annual pneumonia patients - the other a usual care control. 4) Co-primary outcomes are a) Patients diagnosed with pneumonia without chest imaging will be ≥50% lower in the ePNa cluster. b) Antibiotic prescribing for treatment of pneumonia will be ≥90% consistent with consensus guidelines and higher in the ePNa cluster. Safety measures will be unplanned subsequent 7-day ED visits/hospitalizations and 30-day mortality. Based on this rigorous pilot study, we anticipate a subsequent multi-system cluster-randomized trial including Cerner systems outside Utah. Our work incorporates the Five Rights of CDS to ensure that the strengths of this technology are optimized in the clinical environment. We will leverage experience in innovative pneumonia research, pioneering CDS, and implementation science available at Intermountain to successfully complete this proposal. The proposal will be facilitated by and disseminated through Intermountain relationships with the PCORnet Learning Health Systems Network, PCOR CDS Learning Network, the Healthcare Services Platform Consortium, Cerner, and clinicaltrials.gov. Our innovative proposal promises to advance safety for patients suspected of pneumonia in an understudied, high-volume ambulatory care setting. Project Narrative Pneumonia is the most common serious infection among adults, but diagnosis and treatment decisions vary between different clinicians. We will adapt for free standing urgent care clinics a validated, real-time, emergency department deployed, electronic pneumonia clinical decision support tool (ePNa). We hypothesize successful implementation of ePNa using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research into a cluster of urgent care clinics which treat about 800 pneumonia patients annually will improve care processes and patient outcomes compared to a similar cluster of usual care clinics.","Adaptation and pilot implementation of a validated, electronic real time clinical decision support tool for care of Pneumonia patients in 12 Utah Urgent Care Centers",9932165,R18HS026886,[' '],AHRQ,"IHC HEALTH SERVICES, INC.",R18,2020,443454,0.006457869795388732
"Development and Validation of a Prediction Model to Address Physician Burnout PROJECT SUMMARY Professional burnout is a growing epidemic with symptoms affecting over 500,000 US physicians at any given time and carries significant adverse consequences for physician mental health, health care value, quality of care, and patient safety. There is an urgent need to develop reliable methods to proactively identify work environments at high risk for physician burnout, and tailor process improvements accordingly. The objective of this proposal is to develop and validate a real-time prediction model that uses operational data in primary care practices to identify high-risk clinics for physician burnout, enabling timely and tailored process improvements. The central hypothesis is that routinely-collected electronic health record (EHR) usage metrics coupled with practice-specific metrics can predict physicians’ risk for burnout and inform process improvement. The rationale for the proposed research is that early identification of high-risk clinics will allow organizations to tailor interventions to those clinics before burnout and its individual or health system consequences arise. This would be an innovative approach that prevents burnout rather than reacting to it. This project capitalizes on routinely-collect data from Stanford primary care clinics to create a database encompassing EHR usage metrics and practice-specific metrics. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Develop a prediction model to quantify risk for physician burnout. The working hypothesis is that real-time metrics of practice efficiency tracked by the EHR and other practice-specific metrics can predict physician burnout using a machine learning approach. Aim 2: Refine the prediction model using qualitative methods. The working hypothesis is that qualitative assessment will inform refinements to the prediction model created in Aim 1, and will demonstrate the face validity of the model. Aim 3: Validate the use of the prediction model to identify high-risk clinics. The working hypothesis is that quality of care metrics will demonstrate the concurrent validity, that subsequent routinely administered burnout surveys will demonstrate the predictive validity of the prediction model created in Aims 1 and 2, when aggregated at the clinic level. This proposal is significant because physician burnout is a growing problem with important implications for patient safety. It is also innovative in deploying machine learning and mixed methods to identify physicians at increased risk for burnout which will enable testing interventions to reverse this trend. In combination with formal training in quantitative and qualitative methods, expert mentorship, and participation in selected scholarly activities at Stanford, the experience gained through this project will facilitate progress toward a long-term goal to become an academic leader advancing evidence-based reform of the health care delivery system to optimize human factors that improve quality and safety. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an urgent need to develop reliable methods to proactively identify and improve work environments with high risk for physician burnout, and doing so will have broad public health relevance by reducing risk for burnout and its negative effects on quality and safety of care. Addressing physician burnout in primary care carries relevance for AHRQ’s priority populations of women, children, the elderly, and low-income patients, who are particularly dependent on high quality primary care. This project will support AHRQ’s mission of producing evidence to make health care safer and higher quality by developing and validating a prediction model to identify high-risk primary care clinics for physician burnout in order to 1) inform resource allocation to clinics with the highest need, 2) tailor process improvements to reduce risk for burnout and poor quality of care, and 3) lay the groundwork for expanding this model to other high-risk practice settings and provider types.",Development and Validation of a Prediction Model to Address Physician Burnout,10105225,K08HS027837,[' '],AHRQ,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,152582,0.007705710653729407
"Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Patient-Reported Outcome (RISE-PRO) Dissemination Project PROJECT SUMMARY Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are important in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a condition that affects 1.3 million Americans and is a leading cause of disability. Among chronic conditions, RA has many decades of robust scientific evidence around the validity of PROs. PROs are key outcome measures in RA clinical trials and studies, are responsive to therapy changes, are strong predictors of future disability and mortality, and play a central role in facilitating shared decision-making and treatment. Advances in health information technology (IT), like electronic health record-enabled Qualified Clinical Data Registries (QCDRs), provide an opportunity to scale and spread of use of PRO measures nationally. The Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness (RISE) registry is a QCDR that was established in 2014 to improve the quality of care for patients seen in rheumatology practices. The RISE informatics platform aggregates electronic health record data from participating practices, analyzes these data centrally and feeds performance on quality measures back to clinicians using a web-based dashboard. RISE currently includes one the largest PRO measurement efforts for ambulatory patients with a chronic disease in the United States. However, as the registry matures, several critical gaps remain in our national PRO measurement efforts, including the lack of representation of public hospital systems and at-risk populations, the challenges faced by some practices in creating structured data fields in electronic health records to capture PRO measure scores, and the need to evaluate the impact of the PRO collection efforts through RISE. The overarching goal of this proposal is to systematically address each of these issues by 1) creating an evidence-based clinical learning network to support the participation of public hospital systems in PRO measurement and improvement efforts through RISE, 2) developing and scaling a natural language processing system to extract PRO measures from unstructured data in clinical notes, and 3) analyzing the impact of PRO measurement through RISE on quality of care and health outcomes in RA. This proposal builds on the novel informatics platform of the RISE registry to scale, spread and evaluate PRO implementation across a nationwide network of rheumatology practices, with the ultimate goal of improving functional status outcomes for those with RA. PROJECT NARRATIVE The RISE-PRO project aims to use the novel health IT platform of the RISE patient registry to scale, spread and evaluate the collection of patient-reported outcomes across a nationwide network of rheumatology practices. Collecting and using patient-reported outcomes in clinical practice has the potential to transform health care for individuals with rheumatoid arthritis by making care more patient-centered and by providing tools to facilitate shared decision-making, disease monitoring, and population health management.",Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness Patient-Reported Outcome (RISE-PRO) Dissemination Project,9912121,R18HS025638,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R18,2020,493891,-0.00865370492000454
"Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems V (CAHPS V) Consumers, providers and health care purchasers need high-quality information to help them compare and evaluate their health care options. The CAHPS V project will advance the AHRQ CAHPS mission of improving patients' experiences with health care by developing and evaluating strategies for survey measurement, reporting and quality improvement (QI). We propose a 5-year effort to advance the science and practice of patient experience assessment, continue innovation to ensure relevance to health service delivery and implement best survey practices, further the science of reporting, and evaluate CAHPS QI efforts. We will develop program communication strategies, and disseminate and promote use of CAHPS products. In particular, we will develop a survey to assess patient experiences with end-of-life care; develop new items to assess shared decision-making, care coordination, patient engagement, and patient safety; test alternatives to the standard CAHPS modes of data collection), explore the feasibility of administering a short-form survey dividing CG-CAHPS composites among respondents to reduce response burden, elicit stakeholder feedback about the value of different CAHPS supplement item sets, evaluate “The Your CAHPS Survey” that was designed to help users of the CAHPS surveys compile a survey tailed to their specific needs, and evaluate existing Spanish translations of CAHPS surveys. In addition, we will gather input from stakeholders on best practices for narrative data analysis, develop an approach for using automated Natural Language Processing for analyses of narratives, and construct an algorithm approach to select representative narratives that reflect and illustrate overall provider ratings. Finally, we will evaluate the contribution of patient narratives to quality improvement efforts in hospital care for children, characterize primary care practices use of the CG-CAHPS survey and patient-centered medical home items during PCMH transformation, assess the impact of pay- for-performance for care delivered by primary and specialty care safety net providers on CAHPS survey responses, explore the value of new shared decision-making, patient engagement, communication and patient safety items for QI and identify QI strategies that improve patient experience across various settings. We will also advance analytic methods for CAHPS data. The project team is well suited to achieving the study objectives given its prior accomplishments and established working relationships. The work is innovative and designed to facilitate the use of CAHPS surveys and improve response rates to them, enhance reporting and use of CAHPS survey data, and improve health care QI efforts.

"A Training and Fidelity Model to Move and Scale Evidence-based Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Programs into Practice: The Case for COPE in PACE service settings This NIA Stage I study is designed to address two leading barriers to implementation of evidence-based dementia care and caregiver support programs into long-term care settings: (1) lack of streamlined, user-friendly, and tested training modalities, and (2) lack of scalable, practical processes to accurately measure fidelity in “real world” settings. The aims of the study are to determine whether an online training program is the same or better in improving interventionist fidelity to an evidence based dementia program (COPE) and dementia patient outcomes when compared to a high intensity face-to-face traditional form of training. To accomplish these aims we will develop an online, principle-driven approach using state-of-the- science simulation and best practices and a scalable approach to assess fidelity to COPE by applying computational linguistics techniques. We will then conduct a noninferiority trial in Programs for All Inclusive Care for Elders (PACE) organizations randomly assigned to the training conditions. PACE staff will be evaluated post training on their fidelity outcomes. Dyads of persons with dementia and their caregivers will be evaluated at 4 months post COPE implementation on function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and caregiver burden. The findings from this project will lay the essential groundwork for a large scale, Stage III-IV, pragmatic trial of COPE in PACE settings throughout the US. Findings will also serve as a model for guiding the development of practical, scalable processes for training and fidelity monitoring in other long-term care settings and for other evidence-based support programs. Most persons with dementia and their caregivers do not have access to or receive beneficial and supportive evidence-based programs due to the need for scalable and reliable training and monitoring procedures for clinicians. We address this gap to developing and testing a replicable, accessible, and sustainable processes for training and monitoring clinicians in Care of Persons in the Environments (COPE) - an evidence based dementia care program - in a long-term care service setting. Study findings will yield an understanding of ways to move evidence into real-world dementia care settings and can serve as a model for guiding the development of practical, scalable processes for training and fidelity monitoring in other long-term care settings and for other evidence-based support programs.",A Training and Fidelity Model to Move and Scale Evidence-based Dementia Care and Caregiver Support Programs into Practice: The Case for COPE in PACE service settings,9971443,R01AG061945,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver support', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Day Care', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evidence based program', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care for Elderly', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Homes', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical Function', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Registered nurse', 'Science', 'Service setting', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'care providers', 'care systems', 'comparative efficacy', 'dementia care', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'pragmatic trial', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'uptake', 'user-friendly']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,515814,0.0446597008855921

"In silico Randomized Control Trial Framework for Assessing Infection Control and Prevention Interventions in the Hospital Project Summary/Abstract Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), particularly carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs), are a major cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Though studies have found multiple interventions addressing MDRO colonization and transmission to be effective at reducing HAIs, implementation has lagged due to uncertainty regarding the most efficacious combinations of interventions. As patients are connected within healthcare facilities by the movement of healthcare workers (HCWs) and mobile equipment, evaluation of an intervention's impact on transmission and infection must consider these network dynamics. Additionally, each institution has its own staffing ratios, equipment management, and cleaning practices that inform the efficacy of an intervention. To address knowledge gaps regarding the most effective combinations of intervention strategies at an individual hospital, we will build a model framework that will provide hospital administrators and infection control experts with tools for quantifying individual patient risk factors for colonization and infection and for comparing the potential effectiveness of interventions to control HAIs. The aims of the project are: (1) to develop models to predict which patients are at highest risk for colonization and infection with MDROs using clinically relevant information collected during the normal course of care combined with operational data on staffing and equipment movement; (2) to utilize hospital- level models to quantify the combinatorial relationship between, and marginal impact of, additional interventions to reduce HAIs; and (3) to build a framework for other hospitals and healthcare systems to examine the effectiveness of interventions parameterized by their own institution's data. Models will start with the patient at the center, utilizing the rich covariate data stored in electronic health records to develop prediction models based on advanced machine learning. These prediction models will be translatable tools that can be directly incorporated into clinical care to assist clinicians in preventing HAIs. Data on patient-connectedness will form the foundation of hospital-level models that will allow for detailed examinations of the effectiveness of different combinations of interventions. Finally, a generalizable framework will be constructed and tested across a network of healthcare facilities. These models will directly inform CDC guidelines about MDRO prevention and aid clinicians in reducing the risk of HAIs. Project Narrative The models developed through this proposal will improve understanding of how biological factors associated with the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) impact interventions to reduce hospital-associated infections (HAIs). This will aid predictions of patients' risk for colonization and infection, as well as improve understanding of how interventions can most effectively be combined to reduce the likelihood that patients will suffer from these high-consequence pathogens.",In silico Randomized Control Trial Framework for Assessing Infection Control and Prevention Interventions in the Hospital,10110718,U01CK000589,[' '],NCEZID,"CENTER/ DISEASE DYNAMICS, ECONOM/POLICY",U01,2020,550000,0.007301552369135979
"Leveraging Routine Clinical Materials and Mobile Technology to Assess CBT Quality Project Abstract: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been demonstrated to be effective for numerous presenting problems, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Several large mental health systems have invested heavily in programs to train their clinicians in CBTs, but relatively little attention has been devoted to the monitoring or promotion of CBT quality after training is complete. Identifying strategies to do so can facilitate research and training, and is critical to ensuring consumer access to high quality, evidence-based treatments. The lack of a scalable, effective, and efficient method of monitoring quality is a key barrier to efforts to promote high-quality implementation. Self-report fidelity assessments increase clinician and consumer burden and may not accurately reflect clinician skill or the intensity with which CBT interventions are delivered. Observation and expert ratings are time and resource intensive and unlikely to be feasible or affordable in large systems. To maximize the likelihood of broad implementation once effective strategies to monitor quality are established, it is essential that these strategies are feasible and acceptable in routine care contexts, leveraging information collected during routine care. To date, few monitoring strategies that do not involve observation, client/caregiver reports, or clinician self-reports have been tested. To address this critical implementation challenge, we propose to refine and evaluate a method of monitoring quality that is based on an evaluation of CBT worksheets that are completed in session. Because the worksheets were developed to implement core cognitive and behavioral elements and are embedded in CBTs across diagnostic categories, they may be used to elucidate the clinician’s ability to guide the client through CBT interventions in session. Preliminary research with this measure demonstrated high correlations between the measure and observer ratings of clinician competence, associations with subsequent symptom change, and high agreement between raters with differing levels of familiarity with CBT. Completion of the ratings based on worksheets requires only a small fraction of time required for session observation and ratings. This project will compare this novel strategy to observer ratings and adherence checklists that are embedded in clinical notes. Furthermore, it will compare the accuracy of worksheet data collected by mobile app to paper-form worksheets, and assess the feasibility and acceptability of these strategies. Because the core elements of CBT and its worksheets are common across many CBTs, this research has broad implications for monitoring fidelity to CBTs in a variety of mental health and healthcare systems and settings. This research will be conducted by a team of investigators with expertise in CBT, training, implementation, psychotherapy process and outcome research, psychometrics, longitudinal data analysis, mobile technologies and healthcare economics, with input from community partners and end-users. The resulting products have the potential to significantly improve efforts to monitor and ensure ongoing high quality implementation of CBT in routine care settings. Project Narrative: This project will compare two methods of assessing the quality of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that do not involve directly observing sessions, adherence checklists embedded in clinical notes, and rating the quality of worksheets that are completed with therapist guidance during sessions. It will also examine whether ratings of worksheets completed on a mobile app are reliable and valid quality measures. This information can inform strategies to monitor and enhance CBT quality, which can ultimately improve the quality of care and clinical outcomes.",Leveraging Routine Clinical Materials and Mobile Technology to Assess CBT Quality,9901579,R01MH112628,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Anxiety', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Familiarity', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Light', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Paper', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychotherapy', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'clinical material', 'cognitive enhancement', 'community setting', 'cost', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care economics', 'health care settings', 'health economics', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel strategies', 'predict clinical outcome', 'programs', 'routine care', 'skills', 'standard measure', 'statistics']",NIMH,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2020,634252,0.02065942565272583
"Improving Medical Decision Making for Older Patients with End Stage Renal Disease A growing number of older patients are living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to advances in life- prolonging technologies and the aging of the population. As CKD advances towards end-stage renal disease (ESRD), even life-prolonging technologies cannot extend life indefinitely, especially for patients who have a poor prognosis and for whom decisions about medical interventions become particularly important. Consequently, older patients with advanced CKD need to communicate with their physicians about their preferences regarding CPR, dialysis and supportive kidney care (medical management of symptoms of advanced CKD without dialysis) in order to make crucial decisions impacting the length and quality of their lives. Communication surrounding medical decision making is formalized in Advance Care Planning (ACP), a process involving verbal or written information designed to inform patients of possible medical options including CPR, dialysis and supportive kidney care. Traditional ACP for patients with ESRD relies on ad hoc verbal descriptions of treatment options. This approach is limited because these options are difficult to envision. We have developed a video decision aid for reviewing CPR, dialysis and non-dialytic treatment preferences in ESRD. The tool, which is available in both English and Spanish, also allows patients to video record their preferences (""video declaration"") and share their preferences with their clinicians and caregivers. The overall objective of this study is to conduct a multi-center randomized trial of the video intervention (vs. usual care) to test the hypothesis that the video better informs older persons with advanced CKD and poor prognosis of their treatment options and leads to more ACP documentation, informed decision making, and improved quality of life. We will compare ACP documentation after one year (or at time of death) among 600 patients aged 75 or older with advanced CKD and poor prognosis randomly assigned to either the video intervention or usual care (Aim 1). We will compare ESRD treatment preferences, decisional conflict, ACP engagement and conversations, and concordance of preferences stated after the video intervention or usual care with ESRD care delivery after one year (or at time of death) (Aim 2). We will explore the quality of life, longevity, and cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) associated with patients' ESRD treatment decisions in the video vs. control groups (Aim 3). We will also conduct a qualitative assessment of the video declarations as well as barriers and facilitators for intervention success (Aims 4 and 5). ESRD in older patients involves complex decision making. It is imperative that we develop and evaluate early interventions to deliver more patient- focused care to this rapidly growing segment of the population. Using videos to enhance communication offers an opportunity to improve care of this vulnerable group of patients. Video is a practical, evidence-based, and innovative approach that has the potential to improve the quality of care provided to tens of thousands of older Americans. It is imperative to develop scalable and effective approaches to supporting persons with advanced kidney disease and their family caregivers. By providing video education tools to better inform persons making decisions about medical care and offering evidence-based options for kidney care, there is an opportunity to improve quality of life throughout the care trajectory.",Improving Medical Decision Making for Older Patients with End Stage Renal Disease,9946617,R01AG066892,"['Address', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Aging', 'American', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Counseling', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Documentation', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'End stage renal failure', 'Family Caregiver', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Supportive care', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'aged', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'literacy', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'randomized trial', 'secondary outcome', 'success', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment planning', 'visual information']",NIA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,2331112,-0.0030231314599363066
"Wireless withdrawal detection and monitoring system for neonatal abstinence syndrome. SPECIFIC AIMS Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is an opioid withdrawal syndrome that develops shortly after birth to in utero-exposed neonates. The cost of NAS is high: newborns with NAS are typically receive care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), where the daily cost of care is high. Nearly 22,000 infants are born with NAS each year at a cost of $1.5 billion. Moreover, medication-based interventions for the treatment of NAS, used in up to 80% of opioid-exposed infants, carry their own risks of toxicity and drug interactions. Despite the medical cost, high societal impact of NAS, and the risks of treatment, the tools to assess the severity of NAS can be subjective and suffer from examiner bias. There is an urgent need for innovative new methods to diagnose NAS and assess the efficacy of responses to treatment. Flexible, low-cost wearable devices (worn on the skin) that can report measures of systemic biochemical and biomechanical processes offer a simple and economical solution. In NAS, surges of sympathetic nervous system activity produce increased heart rate, skin conductance, unstable temperature, and tremor. These manifest in increased infant sweating, seizures, tremors, unstable body temperature, and more—events that must continually monitored and assessed by nurses. The unsupervised, objective detection/quantification of the bodily response of neonates suffering from NAS could drive the development of new, objective scoring tools that can guide the initiation, intensity, and duration of therapies for NAS. Such tools could significantly reduce medical costs and improve patient outcomes by reducing patient time in NICU, reducing nurse load, improving outpatient monitoring, and helping to assist in the optimization of patient treatments. Critically, we believe such a tool may be able to objectively capture events that may go unnoticed by nurses or while the infant is sleeping (minor tremors, poor oxygenation, temperature fluctuations, dehydration). This proposal seeks to develop interlinked, infant-targeted wearable biosensor-systems capable of continuously monitoring the biochemical to biophysical parameters of opioid-dependent neonates under treatment for NAS. Our team has outstanding experience in all areas necessary to this investigation. Our business unit has extensive NIH funded experience in wearable biosensing, in the detection of sympathetic nervous system activity in opioid withdrawal, pediatrics, business development, and intellectual property. Our academic partners have broad experience in novel biosensor development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rekovar is developing a low cost wearable device that integrates wirelessly with a mobile device to allow real- time monitoring of the baby’s physical and physiological state and its ability to sleep, eat, and be nurtured while undergoing neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). This device has significant impact in helping reduce both hospital stay and costs as neonates receiving pharmacological treatment are usually in the NICU away from family and non-pharmacological care. Our interest lies with respect to proper neonatal care, where separate procedures occur for essential neonatal needs and needs for neonates undergoing withdrawal, and by using this monitoring device to assess addicted neonates undergoing withdrawal, caregivers are provided the better ability of treating the right neonatal needs with the appropriate procedure in hospitals.",Wireless withdrawal detection and monitoring system for neonatal abstinence syndrome.,10013069,R41DA049615,"['Accelerometer', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Biometry', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Temperature', 'Breathing', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chest', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Engineering', 'Dehydration', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Interactions', 'Eating', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hydration status', 'Infant', 'Intellectual Property', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nurses', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sneezing', 'Substance Withdrawal Syndrome', 'Sweating', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tremor', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Withdrawal', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'care costs', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'handheld mobile device', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microchip', 'monitoring device', 'nanofabrication', 'neonatal care', 'neonate', 'neuromuscular activity', 'novel', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid withdrawal', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'prenatal exposure', 'printed circuit board', 'real time monitoring', 'response', 'sensor', 'therapy duration', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,REKOVAR INC.,R41,2020,225000,0.0030269809904127734
"Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation Project Summary Neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) is a time-sensitive resuscitation procedure! essential for ventilation of newborns. It requires an unusually high level of skill due to the narrow airways, relatively large tongue, anterior glottic position, and low respiratory reserve of neonates (Bercic, Pocajt et al. 1978). Given the difficulty of the procedure and the high rate of complications in untrained hands, effective training is crucial. However, intubation success rates for pediatric residents are low under current resuscitation training programs and show little improvement between years 1-3 of residency (23-25%) (O'Donnell, Kamlin et al. 2006; Haubner, Barry et al. 2013). There is a pressing need to understand the factors that lead to poor training results and for innovative training modalities that can bridge the gap left by traditional training and thereby allow rapid skill acquisition. We hypothesize that current training and assessment methods suffer from 4 key weaknesses: (1) Poor realism: manikin and simulator-based training typically provide little variation in anatomy or difficulty level—key requirements for developing expertise (Dreyfus, Athanasiou et al. 1986)—and do not realistically model the look, feel, and motions of real tissue. (2) Subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods: training opportunities are limited by the availability of expert instructors. (3) Poor visualization: learners have poor knowledge about what went wrong and how to improve; they cannot see exactly what is going on inside the manikin or the patient and cannot directly monitor their actions relative to idealized, expert performance. (4) Assessment under artificially ideal conditions: assessments of ETI performance in classroom settings likely overestimate trainees' skill level because they do not mimic the stressors and distractions that are inherent in the real clinical environment. Technology-enhanced ETI simulators can resolve all of these key weaknesses: We have conducted preliminary work (Hahn, Li et al. 2016; Soghier, Li et al. 2014) on an augmented reality (AR (Azuma 1997)) manikin simulator driven by the motions of the trainee and physical manikin in real time that 1) provides a quantitative assessment of ETI technique and 2) allows the trainee to visualize the motion of the laryngoscope inside the manikin. The assessment score can provide feedback during the performance, as well as constitute part of the evaluation of the trainee's skill. Work under this proposal will build on this preliminary work. The specific aims are to: extend the current augmented reality (AR) manikin simulator to a virtual reality (VR) computer simulator and validate, extend and validate automated assessment and visualization algorithm for ETI, study training effectiveness by testing groups of pediatric residents across 3 years to quantify the effect of technology-enhanced methods relative to the current training regimen in terms of both intubation performance on simulators and clinical outcomes in patients, and assess performance under more realistic conditions. Project Narrative The current training and assessment of neonatal endotracheal intubation (ETI) suffers from key weaknesses of 1) poor realism of task simulators, 2) subjective, highly variable, and resource-intensive assessment methods, 3) poor visualization during simulation, and 4) assessment methods under artificially ideal conditions. This high-yield proposal will bridge the gap between training and clinical practice by using quantitative assessment tools and technology-enhanced simulation to improve ETI performance prior to patient care.",Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation: Enhancing Training Through Computer Simulation and Automated Evaluation,9967059,R01HD091179,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Hand', 'Intratracheal Intubation', 'Intubation', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manikins', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatology', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Regimen', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'distraction', 'effectiveness testing', 'evidence base', 'haptics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stressor', 'success', 'training opportunity', 'ventilation', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality simulator']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,319874,-0.00773234161608754
"Communication Bridge: A person-centered Internet-based intervention for individuals with primary progressive aphasia Language impairment (aphasia) is the defining feature of the clinical dementia syndrome primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and significantly compromises the diagnosed individual’s independence and activities of daily living. There are currently no treatments to reverse the degenerative process responsible for PPA, which is caused by Alzheimer’s disease or a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Nonpharmacological interventions including speech-language treatment may offer significant benefit to the diagnosed individual’s quality of life, but there are few efficacy studies and no guidelines to direct best clinical care practices. There are also several barriers to accessing care. Individuals with PPA are under-referred for nonpharmacological services, making it challenging for families to find care unless the individual with PPA lives near an informed specialist. Evidence-based research outcomes from speech-language therapy studies are promising but have been limited to case reports or small groups of local patients and often lack a control group. This project will circumvent both geographic limitations and poor access to care by using a previously validated telepractice model to deliver speech-language treatments to adults with PPA. The proposed study will use a randomized controlled trial design (RCT) to evaluate whether a person-centered treatment (Experimental) for adults with mild PPA maximizes functional communication participation as compared to a dose-matched impairment-only treatment (Control). Ninety individuals with a diagnosis of PPA and their actively-engaged care partners will be enrolled into the study. Both the Experimental and Control arms of the study will receive treatment and evaluations over the course of 12 months. The trial will be supported by a custom web-application, which has an aphasia-friendly design and provides a place for participants to connect to evaluation and treatment sessions.

"Improving Hospital Efficiency: Predicting Post-Acute Care Facility Placement Using Machine Learning and Patient Mobility Scores from the Electronic Medical Record Project Summary / Abstract Annually, approximately 8 million people are discharged from an acute care hospital to a post-acute care facility, accounting for >20% of all hospital discharges and >40% of all Medicare discharges. Post-acute care facilities frequently provide rehabilitation services for patients experiencing functional limitations after acute illness who cannot return home safely. Clinicians in acute care hospitals often fail to recognize hospital- acquired functional limitations until after resolution of acute medical/surgical issues. This failure delays hospital discharge and the start of rehabilitation in a post-acute care facility, which can exacerbate hospital-associated functional limitations. Patients' mobility status, one component of physical function, is an important factor in determining the requirement for a post-acute care facility. Simple, validated tools for routinely evaluating patient mobility are increasingly common in acute hospitals but are not routinely used to predict the need for discharge to a post-acute care facility. One such tool, the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care Inpatient Mobility Short Form (AM-PAC IMSF), is a validated and reliable mobility measure for patients in acute care hospitals. The AM-PAC IMSF is used, as part of routine clinical care throughout hospitalization, for all patients in our acute care hospital. In a pilot study, we demonstrated that lower AM-PAC IMSF scores at hospital admission were strongly associated with post-acute care facility placement. Our goal is to expand upon our preliminary work to develop a formal model to predict which patients are likely to require post- acute care facility placement. Such prediction would be invaluable for improving the discharge planning process and expediting receipt of rehabilitation services at a post-acute care facility. Our overall objective is to demonstrate that prediction models, leveraging `big data' from electronic medical records, can help optimize the hospital discharge process. Thus, we propose the following Aims: 1) To determine if baseline patient mobility status, measured by the AM-PAC IMSF within 48 hours of hospital admission, is predictive of hospital discharge to specific levels of post-acute care; and 2) To develop a dynamic prediction model, using both the hospital admission AM-PAC IMSF score and the subsequent trajectory of daily scores after hospital admission, to predict hospital discharge to specific levels of post-acute care. This proposed research addresses the AHRQ priority of improved efficiency and quality of healthcare delivery via improving the hospital discharge process, with associated improvement in patient outcomes. Project Narrative We propose to use a validated and reliable mobility score, the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care Inpatient Mobility Short Form (AM-PAC IMSF), collected as part of routine clinical care, to develop static and dynamic prediction models, using classification trees (a machine learning method), that will help with early identification of patients needing discharge to a post-acute care facility. Earlier identification of patients likely needing post- acute care facility services during acute care hospitalization can reduce costly delays in discharge which, in turn, exacerbate patients' hospital-associated functional losses and disability. Leveraging `big data' from electronic medical records and the data-driven prediction models via this proposal can fundamentally improve current acute care hospital discharge coordination and planning, along with improving patients' functional outcomes.",Improving Hospital Efficiency: Predicting Post-Acute Care Facility Placement Using Machine Learning and Patient Mobility Scores from the Electronic Medical Record,10056338,R03HS027011,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,99860,0.0027145937911904477

"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems. Applying assistive technology to monitor worrisome behaviors, improve safety, and reduce social isolation in the home environment can reduce caregiver burden and improve care in ways that have major public health benefits.",Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers,9858205,R44AG059458,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applied Research', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'California', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fire - disasters', 'Floods', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Loneliness', 'Mental Health', 'Monitor', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Redwood', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'caregiver interventions', 'community setting', 'dementia caregiving', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'emotional behavior', 'emotional functioning', 'flexibility', 'hazard', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'loved ones', 'mortality', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'social media', 'software systems', 'theories', 'user-friendly']",NIA,PEOPLE POWER COMPANY,R44,2020,2217090,0.0022417192858571783
"Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications Abstract Our objective in this project is to employ population level pharmacy data and delivery of nudges via cell phone text messaging and artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems (HCS): University of Colorado Health System (UCHealth), VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System (VA), and Denver Health Medical Center (DH). We will identify patients with chronic cardiovascular (CV) conditions taking medications to treat hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diabetes and/or hyperlipidemia. We will leverage pharmacy refill data to identify episodes of non-adherence through gaps in medication refills and randomize individuals to 1 of 4 study arms when they have a first refill gap: 1) usual care; 2) generic text message reminder; 3) tailored and engaging text messages optimized to facilitate behavior change; or 4) optimized text messages plus a pre- programmed AI interactive chat bot designed to support identification and resolution of barriers to medication refill and adherence. In the UG3 phase (year 1), we will develop and program a theoretically informed technology-based (a) text message library and (b) chat bot content library using multiple and iterative N of 1 within subject studies to optimize content for a range of diverse patients. These outcomes will inform a pilot intervention to demonstrate feasibility of delivering the intervention and preliminary effects in all 3 HCS. We will also engage patient, provider and health systems stakeholders in designing, refining, and implementing the pilot intervention. In the UH3 phase (years 2-5), we will conduct a pragmatic patient-level randomized intervention across 3 HCS to improve adherence to chronic CV medications. We will evaluate the intervention using a mixed methods approach and apply the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. In addition, we will assess the context and implementation processes to inform local tailoring, adaptations and modifications, and eventual expansion of the intervention. Project Narrative Given the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases that require ongoing treatment with medications, the problem of medication non-adherence is unlikely to go away and will grow. This study will employ population level pharmacy data to identify non-adherent patients and utilize ubiquitous cell phone technology to send them tailored, engaging and motivating text messages and text message based chat through an artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve cardiac medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems. This study will advance medication adherence research and the intervention could be applied to multiple clinical conditions requiring medications for long term treatment and other NIH institutes.!",Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications,9986013,UH3HL144163,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Integrated Delivery of Health Care', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Libraries', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patient Noncompliance', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Self Management', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'blood pressure regulation', 'chatbot', 'copayment', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'financial incentive', 'four-arm study', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'individual response', 'medication compliance', 'medication nonadherence', 'mortality', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'safety net', 'secondary outcome', 'smoking cessation', 'theories', 'treatment as usual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,UH3,2020,1436253,0.019082809079106235
"Wound management through quantitative documentation and prediction Project Summary:  We propose in this SBIR effort to develop a mobile health software system for clinicians to conveniently and/or remotely manage and quantitatively document the healing process of chronic ulcers such as diabetic foot ulcers. Timely, frequent, and accurate documentation on wound appearance and dimension is vital for the growth assessment and tracking of treatment effectiveness. However, current practice is subjective, inconsistent, and even invasive. The absence of easily accessible, repeatable, and quantitative data affects care coordination among the medical staffs and handicaps the best treatment planning for individual patients. For chronic wound sufferers, countless routine visits and the ever increasing high treatment costs also hinders their chance of timely treatment and urgently calls for a convenient alternative.  Built on a seamlessly integrated client-server framework, the proposed management software allows clinicians to easily exchange wound data with the cloud server, analyze the wound healing information, and manage patient's treatment. Together with potentially other wound sensor data, our software system offers objective and quantitative assessment on wound tissue healing status, avoiding misinterpretation or inconsistent grading among medical staffers. With large patient data to be collected, the proposed software is perceived to assist clinicians with evidence based healing prediction and more effective personalized treatment planning.  Every year, approximately 6.5 million Americans suffer from chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, and venous stasis ulcers. The number is projected to grow rapidly due to the aging baby boomer population and a sharp rise in diabetes and obesity. Chronic wound healing is a lengthy process with months or even years of treatment time. Absence of personalized attention could easily cause infections and complications, leading to loss of limb. Evidence suggests that 80% of amputations are actually preventable through access of good quality and routine care. With the ever increasing high healthcare costs and the likelihood of early discharge to home care, patients are highly vulnerable to complications due to the lack of routine checkup or personalized care. All of these validates the urgent need of an alternative, convenient, and low cost clinical practice as what our mobile health app is able to provide. Project Narrative  The proposed mobile health software system to be developed under this SBIR project will provide clinicians a convenient yet comprehensive diagnosis and treatment tool, empowering them to provide personalized and timely care for chronic ulcer sufferers. With its unique client-server framework and many advantages over existing standard of care, the proposed management system will have a reasonably large market share in this rapidly growing multi-billion dollar industry. Lastly, the proprietary mobile health technology can be used for the treatment of other type of wounds and diseases such as burns, acute wounds, battle wounds, and endoscopic diseases.",Wound management through quantitative documentation and prediction,10081799,R44AG067799,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amputation', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Burn injury', 'Chronic Care', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Elderly', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Technology', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Information Management', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratories', 'Limb structure', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Staff', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Monitor', 'Necrosis', 'Obesity', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stasis Ulcer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'Visit', 'Visual Perception', 'Wound models', 'acute wound', 'augmented intelligence', 'baby boomer', 'base', 'care coordination', 'checkup examination', 'chronic ulcer', 'chronic wound', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'data management', 'decubitus ulcer', 'design', 'diabetic', 'digital', 'dimensional analysis', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'healing', 'individual patient', 'mHealth', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'phase 1 designs', 'programs', 'routine care', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'trend', 'wound', 'wound care', 'wound healing', 'wound treatment']",NIA,"XYKEN, LLC",R44,2020,298277,-0.0036054716081582094
"Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout Gout is a highly prevalent, painful inflammatory arthritis, caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Gout flares cause impaired quality of life and physical function, leading to lost work days, disability, high healthcare costs. Patients with gout are also known to be at an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), kidney disease, and mortality. Previous studies suggest a potential beneficial effect of urate-lowering therapy on the risk of CVD and renal function. Over the past decade, the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid (SUA) level below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, based on the upper limit of water solubility of uric acid under normal physiologic circumstances. However, the 2016 American College of Physicians (ACP)’ guidelines for gout management recommend use of urate-lowering therapy but support a ‘treat-to-avoid symptoms’ strategy without monitoring SUA rather than the TTT strategy because of ‘inconclusive’ evidence in the literature. Such discrepancies in treatment guidelines from various societies urge the need for comparative effectiveness research of the treatment strategies for gout.  Rigorous epidemiologic studies utilizing high-quality observational data from electronic health records (EHR) or insurance claims databases can be an important tool for comparative effectiveness research. The primary objective of this 3-year proposal is to provide high-quality, timely evidence on the comparative effectiveness of two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of gout. We will pursue this objective by utilizing the linked Partners’ EHR-Medicare database (2007-2016); this linked database includes all patients aged ≥65 years enrolled in Medicare Parts A/B/D who had ≥1 encounter at one of the Partners Healthcare hospitals. We will have longitudinal, clinically important data on patients’ demographics, body mass index, visit notes, laboratory results including SUA and serum creatinine, as well as all Medicare claims for inpatient and outpatient visits, procedures, and prescription drugs. The two specific aims of this 3-year proposal are: 1) to examine the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of gout flares versus usual care and 2) to assess the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of kidney disease and CVD versus usual care.  Given the substantial prevalence of gout, the suboptimal management of gout and lack of comparative trial of different treatment strategies, this proposed study will make an immediate, important contribution to the management of gout in clinical practice. This work will not only investigate the effects of different treatment strategies on gout flares but also on common comorbidities in patients with gout such as kidney and CVD. Furthermore, this proposed study will advance understanding of how to improve ascertainment of dynamic outcomes and control for time-varying confounding by utilizing sophisticated and innovative epidemiologic as well as bioinformatics methods in a large EHR database linked with Medicare claims. Narrative Gout is a common, painful inflammatory arthritis caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat, are the mainstay of urate-lowering treatment for gout. While rheumatology societies recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, there is currently no clinical data whether TTT approach is better than urate- lowering therapy but no regular monitoring of uric acid levels (i.e., usual care); therefore, this 3-year research proposal examines the comparative effectiveness of the two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of chronic gout in a real-world setting.",Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout,9975704,R01AR073314,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allopurinol', 'American', 'American College of Physicians', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'European', 'Flare', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Hyperuricemia', 'Impairment', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Inpatients', 'Joints', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Research Proposals', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urate', 'Uric Acid', 'Visit', 'Work', 'active comparator', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative trial', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'efficacy study', 'electronic data', 'epidemiology study', 'febuxostat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'population based', 'rheumatologist', 'routine care', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'water solubility', 'xanthine oxidase inhibitor']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,435018,-0.004124935361708195
"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,9886260,K01HL141538,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Deglutition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palate', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Shapes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prophylactic', 'side effect', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support tools', 'systematic review', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2020,143581,0.011947574652087019
"Avoidable Acute Care Use among Patients with Lupus PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Candace Feldman is an Instructor in Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy and the Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). Dr. Feldman has a longstanding passion to understand and reduce disparities in rheumatic diseases. Her research focuses on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in prevalence, access and outcomes among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Her 14 peer-reviewed original publications, 8 first author, and 2 early career development grants exemplify her track record and her commitment to this field. She holds a MPH degree and is pursuing a doctorate in social epidemiology from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her immediate goals are to learn and apply advanced health services research and qualitative methods to understand SLE-related avoidable acute care use to inform a future intervention. She will be guided by Dr. Costenbader, an established SLE epidemiologist, and an expert mentoring team. Dr. Feldman strives to apply rigorous methods to redesign healthcare delivery for vulnerable rheumatology patients. Environment: Dr. Feldman’s Division Chief ensures that >75% of her time will be protected for research and career development for the 5-year duration of this K23 award. She has financial support to supplement her salary and project-related expenses from the Division, the SCS, and her primary mentor’s funding. The BWH Lupus Center, co-directed by Dr. Costenbader, is the largest in New England. The research infrastructure established as part of the Center will enable Dr. Feldman to recruit patients. In addition, the SCS has extensive research infrastructure, which will continue to support her work. Dr. Feldman has access to Medicaid data under Dr. Costenbader’s Data Use Agreement with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and to Partners HealthCare electronic health records linked to claims data through the explicit support of Population Health Management. For her training, she will have access to courses and mentorship at HSPH, where she is a doctoral student, and through Harvard Medical School and the Harvard Catalyst Program. Research: Dr. Feldman will rigorously define SLE-related conditions that may result in avoidable acute care use (e.g. emergency department visits and hospitalizations). She will then examine rates and predictors of potentially avoidable use, and associated mortality and costs in two large, diverse datasets. She will learn and apply qualitative methods, including Photovoice, which will empower SLE patients to photograph their homes and communities, to explore the contribution of social determinants to avoidable care use. Dr. Feldman will hold focus groups of SLE patients, providers and administrators to design a rheumatology-based intervention to improve healthcare delivery for these high-utilizing, vulnerable SLE patients. Dr. Feldman will develop skills in rigorous mixed methods research. This project, and the training Dr. Feldman will gain, will position her for a R01 and for a career as an independent social epidemiology and patient-oriented investigator in rheumatology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lupus is a complex autoimmune disease, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and resulting in high acute care use, much of which could be prevented if patients had consistent access to high-quality outpatient care.

"I-SCREEN: Increasing Screening for Cancer using a Randomized Evaluation of EHR-based Nudges Project Summary Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among older adults in the United States. However, despite established guidelines supporting appropriate cancer screening in order to prevent death and adverse cancer- related outcomes, screening is often underutilized. Barriers to appropriate screening are even greater for groups facing long-standing screening disparities, such as racial/ethnic minorities and individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES). Key drivers of screening underutilization are decision-making biases facing clinicians and patients, highlighting the need for scalable solutions that are designed to address these biases and tailored to overcome barriers facing high-risk patients.  Nudges, interventions designed using behavioral economic principles, improve behavior by addressing biases that lead to suboptimal decisions. Our team has extensive experience working with health systems to test and scale nudge interventions to overcome decision-making biases facing patients and/or clinicians. We have also demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, it is an ideal platform upon which to deploy large scale behavior change nudge interventions.  In this study, we propose to personalize nudge interventions to clinicians and patients, with a focus on how to tailor nudges to the needs of high-risk patients and how to implement promising nudges to improve cancer screening among older adults. We will pilot this work at Penn Medicine and then implement a pragmatic trial at sites in the Penn Medicine, University Hospitals, and Sutter Health systems.  In the R61 phase, we will complete the following aims at Penn Medicine: analyze EHR and claims data and identify characteristics and subgroups of patients at high-risk for not completing cancer screening (Aim 1), test the feasibility of individual nudge interventions within an EHR nudge toolkit (Aim 2), and pilot test nudge interventions to identify the most promising approaches to increase cancer screening rates for high-risk patients in each subgroup (Aim 3).  In the R33 phase, we will achieve the following aims at Penn Medicine, University Hospitals, and Sutter Health: conduct a two-arm pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of personalized EHR-based nudges to clinicians and patients on increasing cancer screening rates (Aim 1), evaluate if EHR-based nudge interventions reduce disparities in cancer screening rates for racial/ethnic minorities and patients with low socioeconomic status (Aim 2), and inform future design of tailored EHR interventions by examining heterogeneity of treatment response with respect to clinician and patient characteristics (Aim 3). Project Narrative Despite established guidelines supporting appropriate cancer screening in order to prevent death and adverse cancer-related outcomes, screening is often underutilized. In this project, we will pilot nudge interventions among older adults – including racial/ethnic minorities, low SES individuals, and other high-risk groups identified using novel analytic methods – and tailor nudges to overcome screening barriers facing these patient groups. We will then conduct a pragmatic, multisite trial evaluating the ability for tailored nudges to clinicians and patients to improve vaccination rates and reduce disparities in care.",I-SCREEN: Increasing Screening for Cancer using a Randomized Evaluation of EHR-based Nudges,10050712,R61AG068947,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medicine', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Psyche structure', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Vaccination', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'cancer health disparity', 'clinical care', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'cost', 'design', 'discounting', 'disparity reduction', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness testing', 'end of life', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health care disparity', 'health care settings', 'heuristics', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'intervention cost', 'low socioeconomic status', 'lung cancer screening', 'mortality', 'multi-site trial', 'novel', 'operation', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'racial and ethnic', 'scale up', 'screening', 'screening disparities', 'social', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R61,2020,329875,-0.02222740408140085
"Mental Health Research Network III Practice-based research has the potential to dramatically improve the speed, efficiency, relevance, and impact of mental health clinical and services research.

"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9983016,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outcomes and Health Services Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical encounter', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'risk prediction model', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2020,169005,0.008534100407483463
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,10001486,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social determinants', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2020,192914,0.009822134720437156
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control.

"Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research Unit SUMMARY   Approximately  25%  of  diabetic  patients  experience  diabetic  foot  ulcers  (DFUs).  This  is  a  significant  clinical  problem since there are no effective biomarkers for predicting outcomes, no drug candidates that have recently  been  FDA-­approved  and  no  therapies  that  are  widely  effective  in  treatment.  The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  2014  with  the  sole  purpose  of  facilitating  clinical  trials,  conducting  translational  research  and  providing  care  for  patients  with  chronic  wounds.  Stanford  AWCC  receives  patients  from the University Healthcare Alliance, which spans 60 clinics and 2.5 million people in the San Francisco Bay  Area.  Despite  being  in  a  relatively  prosperous  area,  Stanford  AWCC  treats  patients  from  diverse  socio-­ demographics. In the past two years, Stanford has treated 6000 patients with wounds, of whom 705 had DFUs.  50%  of  the  patients  enroll  in  clinical  trials  and  there  is  a  very  low  dropout  rate  (less  than  5%).  Under  Dr.  Geoffrey  Gurtner’s  leadership,  the  Stanford  AWCC  has  conducted  over  25  clinical  trials,  where  we  have  measured biomarkers and tested novel therapeutic interventions (Aim 1).     It is known that wound healing trials experience a significantly higher failure rate in Phase III studies compared  to  any  other  drug  trial.  This  is  primarily  due  to  the  poorly  controlled  procedural  component  of  wound  care.  At  Stanford,  we  address  these  issues  by  (i)  practicing  a  multi-­disciplinary  approach  overseen  by  physicians,  (ii)  standardizing  the  measuring  and  reporting  of  healing  outcomes,  (iii)  emphasizing  rigorous  and  efficient  operational  processes  during  clinical  trial  conduct  and  (iv)  collaborating  with  other  major  academic  centers  (Aim  2).  Looking  forward,  it  is  critical  to  optimize  patient  engagement  during  their  treatment  regimens  and  inculcate  a  shared  decision-­making  process.  Clinical  studies  in  medical  fields  such  as  cancer  have  indicated  that  such  patient-­centered  approaches  lead  to  the  adherence  of  treatment  regimens  and  clinical  trials.  This  is  currently  lacking  in  with  patients  with  DFUs.  With  Dr.  Arden  Morris’s  expertise,  the  Stanford  AWCC  practices  new approaches that centers around the patient, with a focus on improvement in their quality of life (Aim 3).     Dr.  Nigam  Shah,  the  Director  of  Bioinformatics  at  Spectrum,  Stanford’s  Clinical  and  Translational  Sciences  Award  has  worked  with  the  Stanford  AWCC  and  developed  computational  tools  that  predict  wound  healing  outcomes. These models have been developed using data from the Healogics database, the country’s largest  network  of  wound  care  clinics  and  a  Stanford  AWCC  operational  partner.  Dr.  Shah  also  has  expertise  in  analyzing electronic health records of patients from large databases such as TRUVEN and OPTUM, which will  allow  for  the  determination  of  unique  biomarkers  for  wound  healing  through  computational  modeling.  These  models can be executed across the entire Diabetic Foot Consortium (Aim 4).    Narrative    The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was
