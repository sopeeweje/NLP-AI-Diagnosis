"Prediction of seizure lateralization and postoperative outcome through the use of deep learning applied to multi-site MRI/DTI data:  An ENIGMA-Epilepsy study ABSTRACT  Epilepsy is a devastating neurological illness that affects 65 million people worldwide. Approximately one-third of patients affected do not respond to antiepileptic drug therapy and require a thorough diagnostic work-up. Structural neuroimaging plays a pivotal role in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with focal epilepsy, identifying visible lesions in many patients that often coincide with the seizure focus. However, 20- 40% of patients have normal-appearing MRIs and this number appears to be growing. As a result, there is increased interest in identifying subtle gray and white matter network changes on non-invasive, quantitative MRI, including structural MRI (sMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), that can help to delineate the epileptogenic network. Unfortunately, methods for selecting optimal features from sMRI/DTI data in patients with epilepsy that can address these clinical challenges have not been developed. There are at least two major barriers that have limited progress in this field. First, sample sizes have been insufficient to develop reliable classification algorithms in patients with focal epilepsy that lead to reproducible findings. The high cost of data collection - few studies scan more than 50-60 patients - has led to underpowered studies whose findings often fail to replicate and cannot adequately model confounds. Second, high computational demands have previously limited the feasibility of using sophisticated, feature-selection (i.e., Machine Learning; ML) algorithms in clinical settings.  A new, large-scale data initiative (i.e., ENIGMA-epilepsy) acquired from 24 sites world-wide is now lifting these barriers and allowing for the development and validation of innovative data-driven approaches aimed at optimizing the use of MRI data in the evaluation of epilepsy. In this grant, we will leverage data collected through ENIGMA-Epilepsy—a new, cost-effective, innovative global approach that unblocks the power logjam by merging resources, data, capital infrastructure and talents of leading epilepsy centers from 14 countries across the world (2,149 patient and 1,727 healthy control MRI/DTI datasets). We will also leverage new developments in ML (i.e., deep learning) and network-based modeling (i.e., connectome- based approaches) and test whether these novel approaches improve upon classification accuracy relative to simpler, user-driven models. Our primary aim will be to test the ability of our deep learning approach (i.e., dense neural networks) to lateralize the seizure focus. In an exploratory aim, we will test the ability of our model to predict post-operative seizure outcomes. ENIGMA's harmonized approach will allow us to test our approach in over 24 datasets, diverse in age, ethnicity, age of onset, epilepsy duration, and surgical outcomes.  This R-21 application addresses NIH's call for more reproducible studies by introducing a highly- powered design, and is directly aligned with NINDS's 2014 Epilepsy Benchmarks, which encourage the identification of biomarkers for assessing or predicting treatment response in patients with epilepsy. NARRATIVE Epilepsy is a devastating neurological illness, affecting 65 million people worldwide. In this project, we will leverage the ENIGMA-Epilepsy infrastructure to address how advanced, non-invasive neuroimaging can be used to develop algorithms for (1) lateralizing the seizure focus and (2) predicting favorable versus unfavorable surgical outcomes. The research will be accomplished by applying novel machine learning algorithms to clinical and imaging data on an exceptionally large cohort of patients with epilepsy and healthy controls, providing unprecedented power to tackle critical diagnostic and treatment-related questions in epilepsy.",Prediction of seizure lateralization and postoperative outcome through the use of deep learning applied to multi-site MRI/DTI data:  An ENIGMA-Epilepsy study,9751025,R21NS107739,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Capital', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Lifting', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'brain abnormalities', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hands-on learning', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized approach', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'surgery outcome', 'white matter']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2019,444315,0.22929467419472854
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy The research objective of this proposal, Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy Prediction, with Pl Dominique Duncan from the University of Southern California, is to predict the onset of epileptic seizures following traumatic brain injury (TBI), using innovative analytic tools from machine learning and applied mathematics to identify features of epileptiform activity, from a multimodal dataset collected from both an animal model and human patients. The proposed research will accelerate the discovery of salient and robust features of epileptogenesis following TBI from a rich dataset, collected from the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx), as it is being acquired by investigating state-of-the-art models, methods, and algorithms from contemporary machine learning theory. This secondary use of data to support automated discovery of reliable knowledge from aggregated records of animal model and human patient data will lead to innovative models to predict post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). This machine learning based investigation of a rich dataset complements ongoing data acquisition and classical biostatistics-based analyses ongoing in the study and can lead to rigorous outcomes for the development of antiepileptogenic therapies, which can prevent this disease. Identifying salient features in time series and images to help design a predictor of PTE using data from two species and multiple individuals with heterogeneous TBI conditions presents significant theoretical challenges that need to be tackled. In this project, it is proposed to adopt transfer learning and domain adaptation perspectives to accomplish these goals in multimodal biomedical datasets across two populations. Specifically, techniques emerging from d,eep learning literature will be exploited to augment data, share parameters across model components to reduce the number of parameters that need to be optimized, and use state-of-the-art architectures to develop models for feature extraction. These will be compared against established pipelines of hand-crafted feature extraction in rigorous cross-validation analyses. Developed techniques for transfer learning will be able to extract features that generalize across animal and human data. Moreover, these theoretical techniques with associated models and optimization methods will be applicable to other multi-species transfer learning challenges that may arise in the context of health and medicine. Multimodal feature extraction and discriminative model learning for disease onset prediction using novel classifiers also offer insights into biomarker discovery using advanced machine learning techniques through joint multimodal data analysis. A significant percentage of people develop epilepsy after a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury. If we can identify who will develop post-traumatic epilepsy and at what time point after the injury, those patients can be treated with antiepileptogenic therapies and medications to stop or prevent the seizures from occurring. It is likely that biomarkers of epileptogenesis after TBI can only be found by analyzing multimodal data from a large population, which requires advanced mathematical tools and models.",SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy,9756832,R01NS111744,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antiepileptogenic', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Limbic System', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Epilepsy', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Rattus', 'Records', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Voting', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'animal data', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'design', 'human data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'laboratory experiment', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,250346,0.1184077936006875
"Assessment of Peripherally Circulating Plasma Proteins and Clinical Risks to Differentiate Epileptic Seizure from Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizure Project Summary / Abstract Accurately diagnosing epilepsy is very challenging and time consuming because clinicians rarely observe the actual seizure, and there are many different types of seizures and epilepsy syndromes with differing presentations. Furthermore, other neurological disorders can be mimics of seizures leading to erroneous diagnosis, inappropriate treatments with significant potential adverse events, incorrect prognoses, and significant waste of healthcare resources. A primary indication that is mistaken for epilepsy is psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (PNES) which is commonly misdiagnosed even by seasoned clinicians. Patients that suffer PNES events experience convulsive events which are similar to epileptic seizures but do not arise from aberrant, synchronous, electrical activity in the brain. Rendering a definitive diagnosis of either PNES or epilepsy is critical to long-term patient health and outcome. In many cases, patients suffering PNES events are prescribed anti-epilepsy drugs (AEDs) and suffer unnecessary side effects. Alternatively, patients that are suspected to suffer PNES, but actually have epilepsy and are not treated with AEDs, are at risk of experiencing seizures and even sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Currently, obtaining a definitive diagnosis of epilepsy or PNES is expensive and inconvenient for patients as it may require inpatient evaluation and a battery of costly tests. Thus, a critical gap in our clinical assessment of seizures, be it epileptic or psychogenic, is an accurate diagnostic blood test that can be used to stratify transient neurological events as either PNES or epilepsy. Towards developing this test, Evogen has developed an innovative informatic approach that incorporates all available clinical information and our protein biomarker approach to detect seizure using an artificial intelligence approach of machine learning. To confirm our previous results, Evogen proposes an epilepsy monitoring unit-based all-comers study which will collect both blood samples and clinical information from patients’ ES and PNES events. Protein biomarker concentrations will be determined and combined with clinical information using a machine learning approach to create a diagnostic algorithm that will provide a probabilistic score that a patient experienced an ES or PNES event. The test will have a profound impact on diagnosis and treatment of both ES and PNES. We believe this test will have an immediate impact on identifying which patients require EMU evaluation. Typically, one third of patients that visit the EMU for a definitive diagnosis suffer from PNES events and represent a large burden to the tertiary epilepsy centers. When patients are referred for EMU monitoring, they are sequentially put on a waiting list and infrequently is any triage used. Therefore, a test that can aid in routing patients with psychogenic events to the appropriate care will increase the accessibility for patients with a high probability of epilepsy. The work proposed here is the first step necessary to confirm pilot results. Upon confirmation, a streamlined development plan has been created to collect all of the information required for CLIA accreditation and bring the test to market. Project Narrative Differentiating epileptic seizures from psychogenic nonepileptic seizure is a substantially unmet medical need. Current tools to differentiate between epileptic seizures and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures have limited performance, high costs and limited availability. A diagnostic test that indicates if a patient recently experienced an epileptic seizure or psychogenic event would provide physicians with objective, actionable data that can result in improved clinical care, patient outcomes and healthcare system savings.",Assessment of Peripherally Circulating Plasma Proteins and Clinical Risks to Differentiate Epileptic Seizure from Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizure,9846171,R43NS113724,"['Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'CCL8 gene', 'CLIA certified', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Electroencephalography', 'Enrollment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Industry Standard', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Intercellular adhesion molecule 1', 'Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Seasons', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'TNF gene', 'TNFSF10 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'protein biomarkers', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'side effect', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'wasting']",NINDS,"EVOGEN, INC.",R43,2019,562119,0.3192059156809889
"Model Development for Prediction of Surgical Outcome in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients: Incorporation of the Correlation between Post-Surgical Reorganization Phenotypes and Pre-Surgical Data Project Summary For epileptic patients who undergo brain resection or ablation interventions, it is the postoperative brain that will dictate seizure status, whether controlled or relapsed. Yet, it is data from the preoperative brain that drives the postoperative prediction process – a critical process for both patient and doctor, and one that is only clinically meaningful when seizure outcomes are predicted presurgically to optimize surgical-decision making. Accordingly, we propose to develop a multi-step model that will establish more accurate predictors of post- surgical seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) emphasizing post-surgical status, for it is the areas of the brain spared during surgery that form the neural substrates generating postoperative seizures. A second perspective motivating our project is the need to identify those changes in functional and structural brain network organization that support adaptive versus maladaptive seizure outcomes following brain surgery. These are the network changes (e.g., the new seizure generators) that dispose and place a potential surgical candidate on a specific outcome trajectory. Therefore, identifying the phenotypes of brain reorganization and change, and incorporating their status into presurgical predictive models of outcome will likely prove crucial to enhancing our ability to predict postoperative neuroplastic responses. While existing outcome prediction models in TLE have focused on clinical variables (e.g., lesional status), we choose instead to focus on structural and functional measures of network reorganization (communication dynamics, regional interactions, structural control). This stems from our belief that capturing network changes throughout the whole postsurgical brain offers a better practical method for identifying and predicting the latent seizure foci (epileptogenesis) that will emerge after surgery. Through machine learning techniques we will deliver an algorithm to be used with new, potential surgical patients, an algorithm that utilizes solely presurgical data, but incorporates our innovative prediction about postsurgical brain organization. Accordingly, our approach provides both a methodologic and conceptual (reorganization phenotypes) advance. The scientific premise leading to our hypotheses is that the failure in the literature to account for the impact of unresected/ablated brain regions, and the brain reorganizations these areas compel, has seriously impeded the predictive power of previous outcome models. Project Narrative For epileptic patients undergoing brain surgery, it is the postoperative brain that will dictate whether seizures are controlled or not. Accordingly, we propose to develop a model that predicts post-surgical seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy, emphasizing the reorganization and change in brain network communication and control that comes with post-surgical status, for it is these features that will actually generate postsurgical seizures. Our innovation is the use of post-operative brain reorganization phenotypes to predict on a presurgical basis who will be disposed to a good vs poor outcome trajectory, highlighting that it is the failure to account for the impact of spared regions, and the brain organization changes these compel, which has seriously impeded the predictive power of prior outcome models.",Model Development for Prediction of Surgical Outcome in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients: Incorporation of the Correlation between Post-Surgical Reorganization Phenotypes and Pre-Surgical Data,9803083,R01NS112816,"['Ablation', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Freedom', 'Generalized Epilepsy', 'Health Personnel', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organizational Change', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Thalamic structure', 'Work', 'base', 'brain surgery', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standard measure', 'stem', 'surgery outcome']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,490043,0.18731470954836824
"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to develop the capability for accurate, reliable seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines, data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG canines with naturally occurring epilepsy.

"Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Neurosurgical therapy of refractory epilepsy requires accurate localization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). In clinical practice, intracranial EEG (iEEG) is recorded in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) over many days where multiple seizures are recorded to provide information to localize the SOZ. The prolonged monitoring in the EMU adds to the risk of complications and can include intracranial bleeding and potentially death. Recently, high frequency oscillations (HFO) of iEEG between 80 to 500 Hz are highly valued as a promising clinical biomarker for epilepsy. HFOs are believed to be clinically significant, and thus could be used for SOZ localization. However, HFOs can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, pathological HFOs are indistinguishable from physiological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy pre-surgical planning. In this proposal, to the best of our knowledge, we show of a recurrent waveform pattern that distinguishes pathological HFOs from physiological ones. In particular, we observed that the SOZ generates repeatedly a set of stereotyped HFO waveforms whereas the HFOs from nonepileptic regions were irregular in their waveform morphology. Based on these observations, using computational tools built on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we propose to detect these stereotyped recurrent HFO waveform patterns directly from the continuous iEEG data of adult and pediatric patients and test their prognostic value by correlating the spatial distribution of detected events to clinical findings such as SOZ, resection zone and seizure freedom. We hypothesize that accurate detection of pathologic HFOs in brief iEEG recordings can identify the SOZ and eliminate the necessity of prolonged EMU monitoring and reduce the associated risks. With these motivations, in this project an interdisciplinary team composed of biomedical engineers, epileptologists and neurosurgeons will work together to develop and test novel computational tools to detect stereotyped HFOs and its subtypes in large iEEG datasets recorded with clinical electrodes. Developed algorithms and iEEG data will be shared with the research community to contribute to the reproducible research and help other research groups to develop novel methods. The results of this study will be essential for achieving our group's long term goal of developing an online neural signal processing system for the rapid and accurate identification of SOZ with brief invasive recording. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prolonged iEEG monitoring for SOZ localization does add to the risk of complications and may include serious issues, such as intracranial bleeding, meningoencephalitis, and eventually death. The intellectual merit of this project is to develop computational intelligence tools based on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques to investigate stereotyped high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in long-term iEEG and test the hypothesis whether the automated detection of HFOs will yield accurate and fast identification of SOZ.",Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy,9802783,R01NS112497,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Meningoencephalitis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neocortex', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Visual', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'computational intelligence', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'signal processing', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2019,488027,0.2186198318957131
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9702876,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,328340,0.30616724141918533
"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings.

Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation.

"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy. The quantitative nature of our acquisition/analysis methods also makes it possible to be uniformly adopted by other centers with high consistency.

"Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Epilepsy is the world’s most prominent serious brain disorder, affecting nearly 50 million people worldwide. For about 30% of these patients, seizures remain poorly controlled despite optimal medical management, with attendant effects on health and quality of life. In order to enable advances in the therapeutic management of epilepsy, a thorough understanding of how cellular processes that drive seizures are linked to large-scale network effects is needed. While seizures impact large brain areas and often multiple lobes, the driving processes span regions on the scale of millimeters. These have been well characterized in animal models, but the relevance to human seizures, i.e. how seizures are driven by brain signals from small-scale processes remains unclear. Instead, the view that naturally-occurring seizures may be attributable instead to large-scale neural mass effects (i.e., the epileptic network) is a subject of ongoing debate. Previously, we defined a key role for surround inhibition in shaping EEG recordings of seizures at the onset site and on small spatial scales. We now propose that surround inhibition has a dual role. On a millimeter scale, its abrupt failure permits the advance of a seizure. At long distances from the seizure focus, strong local inhibition serves to mask the excitatory effects of seizures and may help to hasten seizure termination, while weakened inhibition may permit emergence of ictal activity at a distant, noncontiguous seizure site. Multiple seizure foci may go unrecognized with standard EEG interpretation methods, and are likely a critical factor in epilepsy surgery failures. We hypothesize that once established, multiple ictal generators behave as delay-coupled oscillators, demonstrating activity that is synchronized or even temporally reversed. This results in complex and at times counterintuitive network behavior that can be challenging to reverse engineer from EEG recordings. Typically, however, even intracranial EEG recordings provide only a limited view of neural activity. In this project, an interdisciplinary research group with combined expertise in epilepsy, clinical neurophysiology, computational modeling, and mathematics will conduct a comprehensive study of the neuronal contributors to epileptic networks utilizing a unique combined dataset of simultaneous microelectrode and macroelectrode recordings of human seizures. Using a machine learning approach, we will apply this information to develop a multivariate EEG biomarker based on the inferred source of EEG discharges, high frequency oscillations, and very low frequency (DC) shifts and assess its predictive value for post-resection surgical outcome. We anticipate that the project will lead to a theoretical framework for rational development of innovative strategies for developing interventions to control seizures. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to identify the cellular mechanisms of epileptic networks, a critical barrier to developing treatments based on epileptic network analysis and manipulation. An interdisciplinary team of researchers will address this problem by analyzing and modeling multiscale voltage data from epilepsy patients, and utilizing the results to develop a new multivariate biomarker for seizure-generating brain areas.",Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy,9792276,R01NS084142,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Focal Seizure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Human', 'Impact Seizures', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lobe', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'millimeter', 'minimally invasive', 'multi-scale modeling', 'neurophysiology', 'parallel computer', 'relating to nervous system', 'surgery outcome', 'voltage']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,613085,0.3460073549234496
"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will develop breakthrough technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in preclinical epilepsy research. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on epilepsy research by enabling investigators to perform objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epilepsy in experimental animals to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,9862231,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Body part', 'Cannabidiol', 'Carbamazepine', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clonazepam', 'Clonus', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Face', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phenytoin', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Specificity', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Valproic Acid', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior test', 'drug use screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'method development', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'selective expression', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,450365,0.2396113470157809
"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled.

"Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks. Despite the high prevalence of epilepsy, which affects nearly 4% of the population over their lifetime, roughly one third of afflicted patients are incompletely responsive to anticonvulsant drugs, requiring in severe cases neurosurgical resections or novel approaches such as deep-brain stimulation (DBS). Recently, I helped develop an electrophysiology-based online DBS protocol for seizure detection and interruption in rodent models of absence epilepsy, a form of epilepsy involving aberrant thalamocortical activity. However, like other online DBS procedures which detect seizures as they occur, there was little ability to predict incipient seizures due in large part to limited spatiotemporal resolution of the signal we used, the electrocorticogram (ECoG). ECoG and related electroencephalogram (EEG), being large scale local field potential approaches, do not provide single-cell resolution of neural dynamics that are likely required to obtain predictive information. Over the last decade, the field of brain-machine interface (BMI) has made breakthroughs in neuroscience and engineering by developing methods for multi-electrode array recording of large scale neural spiking activity and efficient reduction of the resultant high-dimensional neural activity to a smaller number of dimensions to effectively control neural prostheses. We predict that this approach will be invaluable for understanding neural dynamics during seizures and stimulation, and for developing predictive algorithms and adaptive DBS protocols.  Therefore, the goal of this project is to precisely characterize thalamocortical neural activity during spontaneous absence seizures and following thalamic stimulation by combining large-scale thalamic and cortical neural recordings, optogenetics, and BMI mathematical techniques. Additionally, the experiments presented in this proposal will use the recorded neural activity to develop adaptive algorithms that both predict oncoming seizure activity and modify stimulation parameters based on the neural state and response to stimulation in real-time. This proposal is aimed towards increasing our understanding of the neural dynamics of epileptic networks and improving the efficacy and safety of online DBS. Roughly one third of epileptic patients are resistant to pharmacological treatment, which has promoted the development of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a means to detect and prevent seizures. However, the neural activity underlying epileptic discharges and the effects of DBS on this activity are poorly understood, partially due to the limited information carried by the EEG signals used for monitoring seizures. A more precise characterization of epileptic neural circuits is crucial to improve current DBS design and enhance the sensitivity and efficacy of seizure detection and disruption, which demands the tools and resources of basic research.",Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks.,9604827,F31NS100265,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Generalized seizures', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primates', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'markov model', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuroregulation', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,33104,0.20092270146132518
"Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     A new electrical biomarker has been identified in high resolution, intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings, called a high frequency oscillation (HFO). Studies have suggested this biomarker has great promise to identify seizure networks and improve surgical outcomes for patients with refractory epilepsy. However, translation of HFOs to clinical practice is hampered by many factors such as spatial, temporal and inter-patient variation in HFO detection rates, false positive and false negative detections, and significant background noise. Big data approaches using large numbers of HFOs acquired from many patients are needed to quantify these effects and allow clinical usage of HFOs. This project details a plan in which the candidate's experience quantifying measurement and detection bias in massive high energy nuclear physics datasets will be combined with a multidisciplinary mentor team to address this problem. The combination of training in computational neuroscience, big data network analysis, and translational neural engineering research will be critical to approach this problem and provide a career trajectory for the candidate. The specific aims of this proposal address three specific confounding factors: 1) the false negative HFO detection rate, 2) variations in HFO features not due to epilepsy, and 3) effects of the state of vigilance on HFOs. Each of these aims involve novel big data methods and/or applications generalizable to other situations: 1) estimating false positive detection rates using a combined experimental/simulated data approach, 2) clustering and classification of distributions of data points, rather than of the data points directly, and 3) a general disambiguation statistic to assess meaningful (rather than statistical) difference between distributions.  The applicant's career goal is to become an academic researcher in the analysis and modeling of intracranial EEG data with a focus on translational epilepsy and sleep physiology research. With the rapid advancement in the resolution of clinical EEG, there is already a strong need for this type of research expertise. Thi grant will provide didactic coursework, formal research and methods training, and career guidance from an expert mentor team. The three mentors have appointments spanning Neurology, Anesthesiology, Mathematics, Statistics, Biomedical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The candidate will also build and mentor a research team and establish external collaborations.  The University of Michigan is a premier research university with strong programs and training opportunities in biomedical and physical sciences, engineering, translational and academic research, and advanced research computing. This proposal makes extensive use of the University's large computer cluster. The mentor team and an external collaborator will provide candidate access to prerecorded, deidentified data from over 150 patients, estimated to have over 40 million HFOs. The environment and mentor team will provide the training, facilities, and data for the candidate to successfully complete the proposed goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Recent advances in epilepsy research are generating very large datasets in the search for better ways to identify the region of brain responsible for generating seizures. A particular signa known as High Frequency Oscillations found in high resolution intracranial EEG shows great promise for identifying these regions, but clinicians are unable to use the signal due to confounding biases.

"Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture Abstract Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common forms of pharmacologically resistant epilepsy. The resection or ablation of medial temporal structures can be curative for many patients. Unfortunately, approximately one third of patients who undergo TLE surgery continue to have disabling seizures post- procedurally. The reasons for suboptimal outcomes are not well understood and therefore constitute a very important knowledge gap in epilepsy care. A better understanding of this difference in surgical response phenotype could be used to improve surgical planning, treatment, outcome prediction and counseling. Promising preliminary studies suggest that TLE surgical outcomes can be inferred by neuroimaging computational tools assessing the cumulative degree of abnormalities in the topological organization of structural networks involving limbic and extra-limbic regions. Nonetheless, network abnormalities are not routinely or systematically used and quantified in the pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsies, and their assessment requires refinement and further validation. The purpose of this proposal is to perform a prospective study to test the hypothesis that the degree of limbic and extra-limbic network abnormalities in TLE, systematically assessed using a connectome approach based on optimized diffusion MRI (dMRI), can be used to predict and better understand epilepsy surgery outcomes. This hypothesis builds on the well-defined basic science and neurobiological premises that epilepsy is associated with pathological alterations in networks that are related to seizure onset and seizure propagation. Importantly, network abnormalities are not visible on routine MRI, but their detection using connectomes constitutes a modern approach to quantifying the location and magnitude of “lesional epilepsy,” where broad computational network abnormalities imply worse outcomes. We will prospectively gather clinical and imaging data at six epilepsy centers using the NIH epilepsy common data elements. This project will be fundamentally based on standard of care data, thus minimizing the burden of extra data collection and ensuring feasibility. Furthermore, this project will be embedded in the ENIGMA-Epilepsy framework, which is a collaborative platform for clinical and neuromaging multi-center research. Specific Aim 1 will define the accuracy, reproducibility, and predictive values of the pre-surgical dMRI tractography connectome model towards surgical results in TLE. We will perform hypothesis-driven tests of specific limbic and extra-limbic networks in relationship with clinical data and surgical outcomes. Specific Aim 2 will test if the neuroimaging-clinical outcome model can be further improved with advanced diffusion methods (multi-shell diffusional kurtosis imaging), resting state functional MRI networks, or a multimodal approach. We believe that this research will have an important impact on our understanding of the mechanisms related to TLE treatment. NARRATIVE While some patients can become seizure free with epilepsy surgery, others persist with disabling seizures and the reasons for vastly dissimilar outcomes are not well understood. Increasing evidence suggests that epilepsy-related neuronal network reorganization is at the core of the mechanisms underlying epilepsy severity and seizure control. This project will use individualized mapping of white matter neural networks to better understand the pathophysiology of epilepsy, identify reasons for treatment success, and guide strategies to improve surgical treatment.",Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture,9840235,R01NS110347,"['Ablation', 'Anterior Temporal Lobectomy', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Common Data Element', 'Contralateral', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electrocoagulation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Freedom', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Publishing', 'Refractory', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'millimeter', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel strategies', 'organizational structure', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tractography', 'white matter']",NINDS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2019,696066,0.21201473744258997
"Interictal high frequency oscillations as non-invasive biomarkers of epileptogenicity in pediatric patients Project Summary Crucial to the success of epilepsy surgery is the availability of a robust presurgical biomarker to identify the epileptogenic zone (EZ). Complete resection of the EZ may lead to medication and seizure freedom. Since the EZ cannot be measured directly, its location is estimated indirectly based on concordant data from a multitude of noninvasive tests. Yet, the results of these tests are often insufficiently concordant or inconclusive. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) serves as the gold standard for the delineation of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). However, the SOZ does not always predict the surgical outcome, and its delineation requires many days of recordings to capture clinical seizures. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs), recorded with iEEG are promising interictal biomarkers of the EZ. Yet, their clinical value for epilepsy surgery is still debated since the HFO-generating area is often relatively large and its complete resection may overlap with eloquent areas. This is often attributed to the presence of physiological HFOs in non-epileptogenic areas. In our recent iEEG study, we showed that interictal HFOs are initiated by an onset generator and spread to other brain areas over time. This generator constitutes a promising interictal biomarker of the EZ since its resection is associated with good surgical outcome. Despite the copious literature on HFOs, the clinical value of HFOs for surgery has been only investigated using iEEG, which presents serious limitations due to its invasiveness and its limited spatial sampling. This application aims to noninvasively localize interictal HFOs with high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in children with medically refractory epilepsy (MRE), distinguish pathological from physiological HFOs, and assess the noninvasive localization of the HFO-onset generator with respect to the surgical resection and patients’ outcome. Our hypothesis is that HD-EEG and MEG can distinguish pathological from physiological HFOs non-invasively and can localize the HFO-onset generator whose removal leads to better surgical outcome than the removal of the area of secondary spread. To test our hypothesis, we specifically aim to: (i) assess the ability of HD-EEG and MEG to localize HFOs; (ii) differentiate physiological (nHFOs) from pathological (pHFOs) HFOs using unsupervised machine learning; (iii) localize noninvasively the HFO-onset generator and compare it with the clinical gold standard for resection tailoring, i.e. the iEEG-defined SOZ; and (iv) assess the predictive value of the HFO- onset generator in terms of surgical outcome. To pursue these aims, we will record HD-EEG and MEG data from 50 children (0-18 years old) with MRE and 50 typically developing (TD) children. This application combines the use of cutting-edge pediatric neuroimaging instruments, 3D printing technology, and innovative signal processing tools together with extensive neuroimaging experience with children. Our research will have a direct impact on the life of children with MRE since it will provide a new noninvasive biomarker of the EZ that would limit invasive long-term monitoring, augment presurgical planning, and improve the surgical outcome. Narrative To lessen the negative impact of medically refractory epilepsy in children, a new pre-surgical noninvasive biomarker that identifies reliably the area of the brain that generates the epileptic seizures is essential. The proposed experiments are relevant to public health because they may lead to a significant improvement of the presurgical evaluation procedure and postsurgical outcome of pediatric patients with refractory epilepsy. The project is relevant to NINDS’s mission because the resulting findings could significantly improve the quality of life in children with epilepsy, one of the most common pediatric neurological disorders, which has a major impact on children’s development and may significantly affect their adult life.",Interictal high frequency oscillations as non-invasive biomarkers of epileptogenicity in pediatric patients,9816907,R01NS104116,"['18 year old', '3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Freedom', 'Gold', 'Head', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Printing', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'base', 'blind', 'density', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'signal processing', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'visual motor']",NINDS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,3384,0.10074933990411052
"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible.

"Deep learning enhanced seizure monitoring from wearable sensors Deep learning enhanced seizure monitoring from wearable sensors Over 1 million patients in the United States have uncontrolled epilepsy despite ongoing medical therapy. When seizures are prolonged or violent, there is significant risk of injury or even Sudden Unexpected Death of Epilepsy (SUDEP) which occurs in approximately 1 in 500 patients per year. Novel seizure monitoring could help alleviate this burden. Our research team has created a software application, EpiWatch, to capture different sensor measurements related to seizure activity such as convulsions (accelerometers), heart rate increases (photo- plethysmography-PPG), and unresponsiveness to behavioral prompting (interactive user interface). Our hope is to offer accurate seizure detection with improved false positive performance to encourage usage. Our team proposes to develop multi-modal sensor analysis driven by deep learning technology to enhance seizure monitoring. We are uniquely positioned to accelerate development by leveraging our team’s prior EpiWatch IRB approved study which generated over 6,000 hours of sensor data. In Phase I, we will teach EpiWatch how to read time series sensor data and how to discriminate seizure activity. EpiWatch will employ a convolutional neural network, a technique rooted in deep learning, to self-characterize seizure features from labeled sensor data. In order to infer additional information from vast amounts of unlabeled sensor data from US epilepsy patients, EpiWatch will incorporate a deconvolutional neural network technique to increase predictive performance. A pilot study of EpiWatch will test its ability to identify the presence of seizures in a prospective new cohort of epilepsy patients. If we are successful, we envision a Phase II proposal which is focused on clinical translation of the technology and assessment of its impact. Our goal is to combine recent advances in deep learning and scalable parallel computing to create EpiWatch. In the long term, we hope this monitoring technology will aid epilepsy patient management and improve outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recurring seizures are disabling, dangerous, and often limit independence. We are developing novel seizure detection using a consumer friendly device with wearable sensors (EpiWatch) to enable monitoring and emergency alerting for seizures that occur without warning (~50% of all seizures) and without witnesses, especially when they are prolonged (> 5 min) or accompanied by cardiac arrhythmias responsible for SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death with Epilepsy), a 1 in 500 annual risk for patients with uncontrolled seizures. If emergency care can be summoned under these circumstances, patients can live more safely and independently, in turn encouraging app usage. When integrated with current disease monitoring activities, EpiWatch will have the long range impact of providing a unique platform for individualized epilepsy care.",Deep learning enhanced seizure monitoring from wearable sensors,9622338,R43NS108905,"['Accelerometer', 'Apple', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biosensor', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'Convulsions', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Situation', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Violence', 'Work', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'novel', 'parallel computer', 'prospective', 'response', 'sensor', 'wearable device']",NINDS,"VIGILANT MEDICAL, INC.",R43,2018,238872,0.3000206720069247
"Seizure Prediction in a Rodent Model of Focal Epilepsy Project Summary/Abstract: Epilepsy is a debilitating neurological disease affecting 50 million people worldwide. While current management of epilepsy depends on continuous medication or invasive surgery, a deeper understanding of circuit-level pathology and an ability to predict seizures reliably will yield more focused therapeutic approaches. We will induce spontaneous unilateral focal seizures in rats by focal injection of kainic acid into the hippocampus. We will continuously record intracranial EEG, LFP, and video data from these rats for a period of 120 days. Relevant features will then be computed, including signal correlations, coherence, energy, entropies, and phase synchronization, as well as features detected by a sparse autoencoder. We will build train predictive classifiers using the first 90 days of data input to the following algorithms: (1) linear regression, (2) random forest, (3) support vector machines, and (4) neural networks. Performance will be assessed by ROC computed for the last 30 days of data. Next, we will apply single pulse electrical stimuli periodically to a new cohort of continuously monitored rats with unilateral hippocampal focal epilepsy. We will analyze the responses to this single pulse electrical stimulus on intracranial EEG and depth electrodes to determine whether seizures can be interrupted, predicted, then preempted by stimulus. Machine learning approaches coupled with active electrical stimulation will render algorithms that identify changes in the electrographic response to stimulus, which predict subsequent seizures with high sensitivity and specificity. We will leverage the fine spatiotemporal resolution offered by optogenetic techniques to study the nature of seizure initiation at the circuit level in a closed-loop system. We will probe the hippocampal circuit considered a generator in focal epilepsy: pyramidal neurons expressing CamK2a. To target each of these elements, we will induce expression of a halorhodopsin driven by the CamK2a promoter via a lentivirus delivered stereotactically to the hippocampal CA3. We will then stimulate the halorhodopsin with 589 nm light pulses, delivered during pre-ictal activity identified by the predictive algorithms and stimulus response. This closed-loop system will be uniquely informative by altering brain states preemptively rather than during the actual seizure as done in previous studies. Our study will ultimately offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying seizure initiation, and may help improve diagnostics and therapeutic approaches for patients suffering from focal epilepsy. Project Narrative: In a rat model of epilepsy, we will study the patterns of brain electrical activity in response to electrical stimulus, and how those patterns change in distinct brain states including: seizure, immediately before seizure, and between seizures. We will use statistical and computational approaches to predict seizures, and subsequently preempt the predicted seizures using stimulus that targets the seizure-generating circuit in the brain.

"Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy Over 5 million children and adults in the United States have had a diagnosis of epilepsy or a seizure disorder. However, treatment options for the epilepsies remain inadequate, because many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to the faster development of new anti-convulsant therapies is the fact that rigorous preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). We propose to test if it is possible to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in various mouse models of acquired and genetic epilepsies. The approach rests on the recent recognition that mouse behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules. These characteristic behavioral modules, and the transitions between them, can be identified without observer bias by combined 3D imaging and machine learning (ML) -assisted analytic methods. We propose to adopt this novel ML-assisted 3D video analysis technology to epilepsy research, in order to test if it can be used to identify mice with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) during inter-ictal and ictal periods in two distinct experimental TLE models, and under various experimental conditions. In addition, we will also test whether the approach is able to automatically detect not only the overtly epileptic mice in a genetic model of severe childhood epilepsy (homozygous voltage-gated sodium channel β-subunit SCN1B-/- knock-out mice), but also distinguish the seemingly normal, non-epileptic, SCN1B+/- heterozygous mice from the wild-type controls. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user-independent, inexpensive analysis of acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will test if it is possible to objectively characterize epileptic phenotypes in mice using a breakthrough technology involving machine learning-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of behavior. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to dramatically accelerate epilepsy research by enabling the objective, automated, inexpensive phenotyping of experimental animals to aid the testing of novel anticonvulsant therapies.",Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy,9503816,R21NS102908,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Image', 'Knockout Mice', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Sodium Channel', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cost', 'dravet syndrome', 'evidence base', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'voltage']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,237423,0.23881737101445097
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9511925,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,328340,0.30616724141918533
"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,9442865,R01NS089212,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Frontal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain pathway', 'density', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preimplantation', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'source localization', 'surgery outcome']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2018,531286,0.22532361542045332
"Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Epilepsy is the world’s most prominent serious brain disorder, affecting nearly 50 million people worldwide. For about 30% of these patients, seizures remain poorly controlled despite optimal medical management, with attendant effects on health and quality of life. In order to enable advances in the therapeutic management of epilepsy, a thorough understanding of how cellular processes that drive seizures are linked to large-scale network effects is needed. While seizures impact large brain areas and often multiple lobes, the driving processes span regions on the scale of millimeters. These have been well characterized in animal models, but the relevance to human seizures, i.e. how seizures are driven by brain signals from small-scale processes remains unclear. Instead, the view that naturally-occurring seizures may be attributable instead to large-scale neural mass effects (i.e., the epileptic network) is a subject of ongoing debate. Previously, we defined a key role for surround inhibition in shaping EEG recordings of seizures at the onset site and on small spatial scales. We now propose that surround inhibition has a dual role. On a millimeter scale, its abrupt failure permits the advance of a seizure. At long distances from the seizure focus, strong local inhibition serves to mask the excitatory effects of seizures and may help to hasten seizure termination, while weakened inhibition may permit emergence of ictal activity at a distant, noncontiguous seizure site. Multiple seizure foci may go unrecognized with standard EEG interpretation methods, and are likely a critical factor in epilepsy surgery failures. We hypothesize that once established, multiple ictal generators behave as delay-coupled oscillators, demonstrating activity that is synchronized or even temporally reversed. This results in complex and at times counterintuitive network behavior that can be challenging to reverse engineer from EEG recordings. Typically, however, even intracranial EEG recordings provide only a limited view of neural activity. In this project, an interdisciplinary research group with combined expertise in epilepsy, clinical neurophysiology, computational modeling, and mathematics will conduct a comprehensive study of the neuronal contributors to epileptic networks utilizing a unique combined dataset of simultaneous microelectrode and macroelectrode recordings of human seizures. Using a machine learning approach, we will apply this information to develop a multivariate EEG biomarker based on the inferred source of EEG discharges, high frequency oscillations, and very low frequency (DC) shifts and assess its predictive value for post-resection surgical outcome. We anticipate that the project will lead to a theoretical framework for rational development of innovative strategies for developing interventions to control seizures. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to identify the cellular mechanisms of epileptic networks, a critical barrier to developing treatments based on epileptic network analysis and manipulation. An interdisciplinary team of researchers will address this problem by analyzing and modeling multiscale voltage data from epilepsy patients, and utilizing the results to develop a new multivariate biomarker for seizure-generating brain areas.",Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy,9687085,R01NS084142,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Focal Seizure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Human', 'Impact Seizures', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lobe', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'millimeter', 'minimally invasive', 'multi-scale modeling', 'neurophysiology', 'parallel computer', 'relating to nervous system', 'surgery outcome', 'voltage']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,689291,0.3460073549234496
"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled.

"Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks. Despite the high prevalence of epilepsy, which affects nearly 4% of the population over their lifetime, roughly one third of afflicted patients are incompletely responsive to anticonvulsant drugs, requiring in severe cases neurosurgical resections or novel approaches such as deep-brain stimulation (DBS). Recently, I helped develop an electrophysiology-based online DBS protocol for seizure detection and interruption in rodent models of absence epilepsy, a form of epilepsy involving aberrant thalamocortical activity. However, like other online DBS procedures which detect seizures as they occur, there was little ability to predict incipient seizures due in large part to limited spatiotemporal resolution of the signal we used, the electrocorticogram (ECoG). ECoG and related electroencephalogram (EEG), being large scale local field potential approaches, do not provide single-cell resolution of neural dynamics that are likely required to obtain predictive information. Over the last decade, the field of brain-machine interface (BMI) has made breakthroughs in neuroscience and engineering by developing methods for multi-electrode array recording of large scale neural spiking activity and efficient reduction of the resultant high-dimensional neural activity to a smaller number of dimensions to effectively control neural prostheses. We predict that this approach will be invaluable for understanding neural dynamics during seizures and stimulation, and for developing predictive algorithms and adaptive DBS protocols.  Therefore, the goal of this project is to precisely characterize thalamocortical neural activity during spontaneous absence seizures and following thalamic stimulation by combining large-scale thalamic and cortical neural recordings, optogenetics, and BMI mathematical techniques. Additionally, the experiments presented in this proposal will use the recorded neural activity to develop adaptive algorithms that both predict oncoming seizure activity and modify stimulation parameters based on the neural state and response to stimulation in real-time. This proposal is aimed towards increasing our understanding of the neural dynamics of epileptic networks and improving the efficacy and safety of online DBS. Roughly one third of epileptic patients are resistant to pharmacological treatment, which has promoted the development of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a means to detect and prevent seizures. However, the neural activity underlying epileptic discharges and the effects of DBS on this activity are poorly understood, partially due to the limited information carried by the EEG signals used for monitoring seizures. A more precise characterization of epileptic neural circuits is crucial to improve current DBS design and enhance the sensitivity and efficacy of seizure detection and disruption, which demands the tools and resources of basic research.",Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks.,9408441,F31NS100265,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Generalized seizures', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primates', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'markov model', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuroregulation', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,38516,0.20092270146132518
"Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     A new electrical biomarker has been identified in high resolution, intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings, called a high frequency oscillation (HFO). Studies have suggested this biomarker has great promise to identify seizure networks and improve surgical outcomes for patients with refractory epilepsy. However, translation of HFOs to clinical practice is hampered by many factors such as spatial, temporal and inter-patient variation in HFO detection rates, false positive and false negative detections, and significant background noise. Big data approaches using large numbers of HFOs acquired from many patients are needed to quantify these effects and allow clinical usage of HFOs. This project details a plan in which the candidate's experience quantifying measurement and detection bias in massive high energy nuclear physics datasets will be combined with a multidisciplinary mentor team to address this problem. The combination of training in computational neuroscience, big data network analysis, and translational neural engineering research will be critical to approach this problem and provide a career trajectory for the candidate. The specific aims of this proposal address three specific confounding factors: 1) the false negative HFO detection rate, 2) variations in HFO features not due to epilepsy, and 3) effects of the state of vigilance on HFOs. Each of these aims involve novel big data methods and/or applications generalizable to other situations: 1) estimating false positive detection rates using a combined experimental/simulated data approach, 2) clustering and classification of distributions of data points, rather than of the data points directly, and 3) a general disambiguation statistic to assess meaningful (rather than statistical) difference between distributions.  The applicant's career goal is to become an academic researcher in the analysis and modeling of intracranial EEG data with a focus on translational epilepsy and sleep physiology research. With the rapid advancement in the resolution of clinical EEG, there is already a strong need for this type of research expertise. Thi grant will provide didactic coursework, formal research and methods training, and career guidance from an expert mentor team. The three mentors have appointments spanning Neurology, Anesthesiology, Mathematics, Statistics, Biomedical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The candidate will also build and mentor a research team and establish external collaborations.  The University of Michigan is a premier research university with strong programs and training opportunities in biomedical and physical sciences, engineering, translational and academic research, and advanced research computing. This proposal makes extensive use of the University's large computer cluster. The mentor team and an external collaborator will provide candidate access to prerecorded, deidentified data from over 150 patients, estimated to have over 40 million HFOs. The environment and mentor team will provide the training, facilities, and data for the candidate to successfully complete the proposed goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Recent advances in epilepsy research are generating very large datasets in the search for better ways to identify the region of brain responsible for generating seizures. A particular signa known as High Frequency Oscillations found in high resolution intracranial EEG shows great promise for identifying these regions, but clinicians are unable to use the signal due to confounding biases. This project combines big data processing expertise from particle physics, computer science and machine learning to address these confounds, providing a more accurate process to enable clinical translation of this new biomarker and potentially improve clinical outcomes.",Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy,9534672,K01ES026839,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesiology', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manpower and Training', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Energy', 'Nuclear Physics', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer cluster', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'detector', 'expectation', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'particle physics', 'patient population', 'patient variability', 'physical science', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'signal processing', 'spatial temporal variation', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'surgery outcome', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'vigilance']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2018,148964,0.11917641954480712
"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible.

"ISPW8 Conference: Designing the next generation of closed loop seizure control Project Summary The overall objective of this effort is to convene “ISPW8: Designing the next generation of closed loop seizure control”, that will take place August 20-23, 2017 at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. This conference is the next in a series of seizure prediction workshops that started in 2002, and has become the premier international venue for quantitative epilepsy research. The goal of this upcoming meeting is to focus on the development of all stages of a next-generation seizure control device. The first day will have two didactic sessions, one focusing on the clinical aspects of epilepsy, the other on Big Data analytic techniques. The body of the conference will be organized around themes motivated by the three stages of closed loop intervention: 1) input: sensing and biomarkers, 2) processing: system analysis, 3) output: intervention. The theme of the second day of will be on multimodal sensors and biomarkers of epilepsy, focused especially on developing new technology. The theme of the third day will be on utilizing advanced machine learning, statistics, and computational models, to understand and characterize the large datasets from high resolution technology. The final day will be on novel interventions and control theory: new strategies for implantable anti-seizure interventions and methods for optimizing them, as well as implementation into closed loop control devices. “Provocative sessions” at the end of each day will focus on unpublished research and hypotheses followed by discussion and debate. Through this conference we aim to build bridges between the many disciplines that comprise this unique field: theoretical, computational, experimental, clinical, and industry, while also preparing the next wave of young researchers. The overall goal is to develop improved quantitative methods to predict, quantify, characterize, and control seizures. NIH funding is sought for travel support to encourage US participation. Project Relevance/Project Narrative We plan to convene an international meeting to address questions at the intersection of clinical neurophysiology, engineering, computational and epilepsy neuroscience using emerging technologies and quantitative methods.

"Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy Over 5 million children and adults in the United States have had a diagnosis of epilepsy or a seizure disorder. However, treatment options for the epilepsies remain inadequate, because many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and from the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to the faster development of new anti-convulsant therapies is the fact that rigorous preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). We propose to test if it is possible to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in various mouse models of acquired and genetic epilepsies. The approach rests on the recent recognition that mouse behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules. These characteristic behavioral modules, and the transitions between them, can be identified without observer bias by combined 3D imaging and machine learning (ML) -assisted analytic methods. We propose to adopt this novel ML-assisted 3D video analysis technology to epilepsy research, in order to test if it can be used to identify mice with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) during inter-ictal and ictal periods in two distinct experimental TLE models, and under various experimental conditions. In addition, we will also test whether the approach is able to automatically detect not only the overtly epileptic mice in a genetic model of severe childhood epilepsy (homozygous voltage-gated sodium channel β-subunit SCN1B-/- knock-out mice), but also distinguish the seemingly normal, non-epileptic, SCN1B+/- heterozygous mice from the wild-type controls. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user-independent, inexpensive analysis of acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will test if it is possible to objectively characterize epileptic phenotypes in mice using a breakthrough technology involving machine learning-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of behavior. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to dramatically accelerate epilepsy research by enabling the objective, automated, inexpensive phenotyping of experimental animals to aid the testing of novel anticonvulsant therapies.",Towards automated phenotyping in epilepsy,9369284,R21NS102908,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Image', 'Knockout Mice', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Sodium Channel', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'voltage']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,197528,0.23881737101445097
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9275549,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,330348,0.30616724141918533
"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,9240674,R01NS089212,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Frontal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain pathway', 'density', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preimplantation', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'source localization']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2017,531286,0.22532361542045332
"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled. PROJECT NARRATIVE The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques as well as automatic clustering approaches based on quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution.

"Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks. Despite the high prevalence of epilepsy, which affects nearly 4% of the population over their lifetime, roughly one third of afflicted patients are incompletely responsive to anticonvulsant drugs, requiring in severe cases neurosurgical resections or novel approaches such as deep-brain stimulation (DBS). Recently, I helped develop an electrophysiology-based online DBS protocol for seizure detection and interruption in rodent models of absence epilepsy, a form of epilepsy involving aberrant thalamocortical activity. However, like other online DBS procedures which detect seizures as they occur, there was little ability to predict incipient seizures due in large part to limited spatiotemporal resolution of the signal we used, the electrocorticogram (ECoG). ECoG and related electroencephalogram (EEG), being large scale local field potential approaches, do not provide single-cell resolution of neural dynamics that are likely required to obtain predictive information. Over the last decade, the field of brain-machine interface (BMI) has made breakthroughs in neuroscience and engineering by developing methods for multi-electrode array recording of large scale neural spiking activity and efficient reduction of the resultant high-dimensional neural activity to a smaller number of dimensions to effectively control neural prostheses. We predict that this approach will be invaluable for understanding neural dynamics during seizures and stimulation, and for developing predictive algorithms and adaptive DBS protocols.  Therefore, the goal of this project is to precisely characterize thalamocortical neural activity during spontaneous absence seizures and following thalamic stimulation by combining large-scale thalamic and cortical neural recordings, optogenetics, and BMI mathematical techniques. Additionally, the experiments presented in this proposal will use the recorded neural activity to develop adaptive algorithms that both predict oncoming seizure activity and modify stimulation parameters based on the neural state and response to stimulation in real-time. This proposal is aimed towards increasing our understanding of the neural dynamics of epileptic networks and improving the efficacy and safety of online DBS. Roughly one third of epileptic patients are resistant to pharmacological treatment, which has promoted the development of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a means to detect and prevent seizures. However, the neural activity underlying epileptic discharges and the effects of DBS on this activity are poorly understood, partially due to the limited information carried by the EEG signals used for monitoring seizures. A more precise characterization of epileptic neural circuits is crucial to improve current DBS design and enhance the sensitivity and efficacy of seizure detection and disruption, which demands the tools and resources of basic research.",Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks.,9257233,F31NS100265,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Generalized seizures', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primates', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'markov model', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuroregulation', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,44044,0.20092270146132518
"Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     A new electrical biomarker has been identified in high resolution, intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings, called a high frequency oscillation (HFO). Studies have suggested this biomarker has great promise to identify seizure networks and improve surgical outcomes for patients with refractory epilepsy. However, translation of HFOs to clinical practice is hampered by many factors such as spatial, temporal and inter-patient variation in HFO detection rates, false positive and false negative detections, and significant background noise. Big data approaches using large numbers of HFOs acquired from many patients are needed to quantify these effects and allow clinical usage of HFOs. This project details a plan in which the candidate's experience quantifying measurement and detection bias in massive high energy nuclear physics datasets will be combined with a multidisciplinary mentor team to address this problem. The combination of training in computational neuroscience, big data network analysis, and translational neural engineering research will be critical to approach this problem and provide a career trajectory for the candidate. The specific aims of this proposal address three specific confounding factors: 1) the false negative HFO detection rate, 2) variations in HFO features not due to epilepsy, and 3) effects of the state of vigilance on HFOs. Each of these aims involve novel big data methods and/or applications generalizable to other situations: 1) estimating false positive detection rates using a combined experimental/simulated data approach, 2) clustering and classification of distributions of data points, rather than of the data points directly, and 3) a general disambiguation statistic to assess meaningful (rather than statistical) difference between distributions.  The applicant's career goal is to become an academic researcher in the analysis and modeling of intracranial EEG data with a focus on translational epilepsy and sleep physiology research. With the rapid advancement in the resolution of clinical EEG, there is already a strong need for this type of research expertise. Thi grant will provide didactic coursework, formal research and methods training, and career guidance from an expert mentor team. The three mentors have appointments spanning Neurology, Anesthesiology, Mathematics, Statistics, Biomedical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The candidate will also build and mentor a research team and establish external collaborations.  The University of Michigan is a premier research university with strong programs and training opportunities in biomedical and physical sciences, engineering, translational and academic research, and advanced research computing. This proposal makes extensive use of the University's large computer cluster. The mentor team and an external collaborator will provide candidate access to prerecorded, deidentified data from over 150 patients, estimated to have over 40 million HFOs. The environment and mentor team will provide the training, facilities, and data for the candidate to successfully complete the proposed goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Recent advances in epilepsy research are generating very large datasets in the search for better ways to identify the region of brain responsible for generating seizures. A particular signa known as High Frequency Oscillations found in high resolution intracranial EEG shows great promise for identifying these regions, but clinicians are unable to use the signal due to confounding biases.

"Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of their life. Despite spending as little a 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month), people with epilepsy take anti-epileptic drugs (AED) daily, suffer AED related side effects, and spend their lives dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment).

"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9134899,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'response', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,334212,0.30616724141918533
"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,9021699,R01NS089212,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Frontal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Resected', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain pathway', 'density', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preimplantation', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2016,531286,0.22532361542045332

"Computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to build computer-aided detection (CAD) software for use in identifying cortical malformations known as focal cortical dysplasia's (FCDs), which are a common cause of epileptic seizures. The intent is for the software, used by a neuroradiologist at a clinical workstation, to decrease the time- intensive nature of the visual search for cortical dysplasia's, while simultaneously increasing sensitivity o dysplasia identification, thus reducing the number of missed lesions and making neuroradiologists more effective and more efficient.  Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, that exacts a large toll upon society in terms of both quality of life and health care costs. Malformations of cortical development (MCD) are the most common cause of seizures in children and the second most common cause in adults. Focal cortical dysplasia is a common form of MCD that is responsible for the vast majority of treatment resistant epilepsy in patients with MCD, and when anti-epileptic medication is ineffective, detection of FCD becomes critical to the ability of the epilepsy team to offer surgery which is often these patient's last hope for seizure freedom.  Unfortunately, the radiological diagnosis of FCD is exceedingly difficult in a large percentage of cases due to their focal and subtle nature. Thus, while resection of these dysplasias can often cure seizures, they can be missed for years or decades, resulting in increased neurological damage and degradation of quality of life due to chronic seizures. In principle high resolution MRI can be used to increase diagnostic accuracy. While this is becoming more common in clinical practice, the need for high patient throughput, lack of clinical information and inexperience often results i these lesions being missed on routine clinical reads by neuroradiologists.  The project will build upon a foundation of existing technology for the generation of quantitative measures of the human brain based on MRI imaging, known in the neuroimaging research domain as FreeSurfer. The project will make use of an MRI dataset of 100 subjects with histologically-confirmed FCD to be labeled by four neuroradiologists, and control subjects with epilepsy that is not due to FCD. The project has three aims: gathering the dataset and expansion of the detection algorithms tested in Phase I to include additional MRI biomarkers; development of an MRI scanner slice prescription component to ensure imaging of an FCD at the optimal visualization plane; and an aim to submit a commercialized version of FreeSurfer for FDA 510(k) clearance. The latter aim is important for the long-term project goal of advancing the state of other clinical detection methods through the building of additional CAD tools making use of FreeSurfer's brain measures, including diseases as varied as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, tumor monitoring and hydrocephalus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposal is to build software for computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs), a malformation of brain development that is a common cause of epileptic seizures in children and adults. The proposed software will offer a neuroradiologist a faster and more accurate detection method compared to visual inspection only.

The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily AED approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting. Periods of low seizure probability would not require AEDs, or at least lower doses of AEDs, thus reducing AED exposure and their side effects. Periods of high seizure probability may respond to acute AED and patients could alter their activities to avoid injury. Patients would be empowered to manage their medications and life activities using reliable seizure forecasts. In this grant we investigate the hypothesis that seizures are predictable events, and pursue accurate, clinically relevant seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines (SVM), data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG (iEEG) in focal canine epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishin a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive therapies. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This study provides a unique opportunity to study seizure forecasting in naturally occurring canine epilepsy under uniform conditions (the same environment). Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate devices designed for human use. The hypotheses driving this proposal are that focal seizures are not random events and there are brain states associated with low or high probability of seizure occurrence, and that these states can be reliably classified using machine learning approaches (SVM & Universum-SVM) that combine features from iEEG, behavioral state tracking, and electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate variability. The goal of this proposal is to develop reliable seizure forecasting (when possible) and improved understanding (data characterization) when good forecasting is not possible.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to develop the capability for accurate, reliable seizure forecasting using recent advances in support vector machines, data-analytic models, and Universum-SVM applied to continuous intracranial EEG canines with naturally occurring epilepsy. Naturally occurring focal canine epilepsy is an excellent model for investigation of seizure forecasting because of the clinical and electrophsyiological similarity to focal human epilepsy. This is an initial step in establishing a new treatment paradigm for focal epilepsy, whereby the probability of seizure occurrence is continuously tracked for patient warning and intelligent responsive neurostimulative or pharmacological therapies.            ",Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning,8944773,R01NS092882,"['Acute', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Canis familiaris', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Device Designs', 'Dose', 'Drug Exposure', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Focal Seizure', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Rate', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Neocortex', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Psychological Impact', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'clinically relevant', 'empowered', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'training aid']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2015,510258,0.40044409828281863
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.            ",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9004826,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,319087,0.30616724141918533
"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.            ",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,8900645,R01NS089212,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Frontal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Resected', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain pathway', 'density', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'preimplantation', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2015,552097,0.22532361542045332
"Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     A new electrical biomarker has been identified in high resolution, intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings, called a high frequency oscillation (HFO). Studies have suggested this biomarker has great promise to identify seizure networks and improve surgical outcomes for patients with refractory epilepsy. However, translation of HFOs to clinical practice is hampered by many factors such as spatial, temporal and inter-patient variation in HFO detection rates, false positive and false negative detections, and significant background noise. Big data approaches using large numbers of HFOs acquired from many patients are needed to quantify these effects and allow clinical usage of HFOs. This project details a plan in which the candidate's experience quantifying measurement and detection bias in massive high energy nuclear physics datasets will be combined with a multidisciplinary mentor team to address this problem. The combination of training in computational neuroscience, big data network analysis, and translational neural engineering research will be critical to approach this problem and provide a career trajectory for the candidate. The specific aims of this proposal address three specific confounding factors: 1) the false negative HFO detection rate, 2) variations in HFO features not due to epilepsy, and 3) effects of the state of vigilance on HFOs. Each of these aims involve novel big data methods and/or applications generalizable to other situations: 1) estimating false positive detection rates using a combined experimental/simulated data approach, 2) clustering and classification of distributions of data points, rather than of the data points directly, and 3) a general disambiguation statistic to assess meaningful (rather than statistical) difference between distributions.  The applicant's career goal is to become an academic researcher in the analysis and modeling of intracranial EEG data with a focus on translational epilepsy and sleep physiology research. With the rapid advancement in the resolution of clinical EEG, there is already a strong need for this type of research expertise. Thi grant will provide didactic coursework, formal research and methods training, and career guidance from an expert mentor team. The three mentors have appointments spanning Neurology, Anesthesiology, Mathematics, Statistics, Biomedical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The candidate will also build and mentor a research team and establish external collaborations.  The University of Michigan is a premier research university with strong programs and training opportunities in biomedical and physical sciences, engineering, translational and academic research, and advanced research computing. This proposal makes extensive use of the University's large computer cluster. The mentor team and an external collaborator will provide candidate access to prerecorded, deidentified data from over 150 patients, estimated to have over 40 million HFOs. The environment and mentor team will provide the training, facilities, and data for the candidate to successfully complete the proposed goals.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Recent advances in epilepsy research are generating very large datasets in the search for better ways to identify the region of brain responsible for generating seizures. A particular signa known as High Frequency Oscillations found in high resolution intracranial EEG shows great promise for identifying these regions, but clinicians are unable to use the signal due to confounding biases. This project combines big data processing expertise from particle physics, computer science and machine learning to address these confounds, providing a more accurate process to enable clinical translation of this new biomarker and potentially improve clinical outcomes.                ",Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy,9041723,K01ES026839,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesiology', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manpower and Training', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Physics', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer cluster', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'detector', 'expectation', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'particle physics', 'patient population', 'physical science', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'signal processing', 'sleep epilepsy', 'spatial temporal variation', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tool', 'vigilance']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2015,138213,0.11917641954480712
"Computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to build computer-aided detection (CAD) software for use in identifying cortical malformations known as focal cortical dysplasia's (FCDs), which are a common cause of epileptic seizures. The intent is for the software, used by a neuroradiologist at a clinical workstation, to decrease the time- intensive nature of the visual search for cortical dysplasia's, while simultaneously increasing sensitivity o dysplasia identification, thus reducing the number of missed lesions and making neuroradiologists more effective and more efficient.  Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, that exacts a large toll upon society in terms of both quality of life and health care costs. Malformations of cortical development (MCD) are the most common cause of seizures in children and the second most common cause in adults. Focal cortical dysplasia is a common form of MCD that is responsible for the vast majority of treatment resistant epilepsy in patients with MCD, and when anti-epileptic medication is ineffective, detection of FCD becomes critical to the ability of the epilepsy team to offer surgery which is often these patient's last hope for seizure freedom.  Unfortunately, the radiological diagnosis of FCD is exceedingly difficult in a large percentage of cases due to their focal and subtle nature. Thus, while resection of these dysplasias can often cure seizures, they can be missed for years or decades, resulting in increased neurological damage and degradation of quality of life due to chronic seizures. In principle high resolution MRI can be used to increase diagnostic accuracy. While this is becoming more common in clinical practice, the need for high patient throughput, lack of clinical information and inexperience often results i these lesions being missed on routine clinical reads by neuroradiologists.  The project will build upon a foundation of existing technology for the generation of quantitative measures of the human brain based on MRI imaging, known in the neuroimaging research domain as FreeSurfer. The project will make use of an MRI dataset of 100 subjects with histologically-confirmed FCD to be labeled by four neuroradiologists, and control subjects with epilepsy that is not due to FCD. The project has three aims: gathering the dataset and expansion of the detection algorithms tested in Phase I to include additional MRI biomarkers; development of an MRI scanner slice prescription component to ensure imaging of an FCD at the optimal visualization plane; and an aim to submit a commercialized version of FreeSurfer for FDA 510(k) clearance. The latter aim is important for the long-term project goal of advancing the state of other clinical detection methods through the building of additional CAD tools making use of FreeSurfer's brain measures, including diseases as varied as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, tumor monitoring and hydrocephalus.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposal is to build software for computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs), a malformation of brain development that is a common cause of epileptic seizures in children and adults. The proposed software will offer a neuroradiologist a faster and more accurate detection method compared to visual inspection only. By identifying abnormalities otherwise missed, the ensuing surgical removal of an abnormality can often stop seizures.            ",Computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias,8903251,R44NS083101,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Back', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Cortical Dysplasia', 'Cortical Malformation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Formulations', 'Dysplasia', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Equipment', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Seizures', 'Slice', 'Societies', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Vendor', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'brain malformation', 'clinical practice', 'computer aided detection', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gray matter', 'interest', 'migration', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vector', 'visual search', 'white matter']",NINDS,"CORTICOMETRICS, LLC",R44,2015,750677,0.2011876988214859
"Neurophysiologically Based Responsive Pharmacotherapy for Epilepsy     DESCRIPTION: Despite taking daily medications, over 1/3 of patients with epilepsy continue to have seizures, and many  more experience significant adverse side effects from antiepileptic drugs (AED). Though patients may spend as little as 0.01% of their time actually having seizures, they must maintain chronic therapeutic AED levels for years to decades. The reason AEDs are taken daily for seizures that only occur sporadically, and in many  cases infrequently, is because patients do not know when a seizure will strike. Arguably the unpredictability of seizures and the adverse cognitive and physical side effects associated with AEDs, are the most disabling aspects of epilepsy. We now have compelling evidence from humans that seizures are not random events, but rather are associated with intracranial EEG (lEEG) changes that occur tens of minutes to hours before clinical events. This research has lead NeuroVista Inc. to develop a seizure advisory system (SAS) that uses iEEG and machine learning algorithms to track the probability of seizure occurrence. Using patient specific algorithms NeuroVista's SAS can forecast periods of increased and decreased seizure likelihood with high sensitivity and specificity, benchmarked against a chance predictor. NeuroVista's SAS has been validated in humans undergoing IEEG monitoring for epilepsy surgery, and has recently been approved for a human pilot clinical trial in Australia.  We propose to use the NeuroVista's SAS device to guide the delivery of AEDs. We hypothesize that intelligent delivery of AEDs at times of increased seizure likelihood will effectively prevent clinical seizures.  During periods of low seizure likelihood AEDs would not be required, reducing side effects. In this proposal we develop and test neurophysiologically-based responsive pharmacotherapy in naturally occurring canine epilepsy as the first step in creating a new treatment paradigm for medically resistant human partial epilepsy.  Naturally occurring canine partial epilepsy is an ideal model for developing this therapy because of the clinical, physiological, and pharmacological similarities between canine and human partial epilepsy. In addition, dogs are large enough to tolerate implantation of the human SAS device. This project will lead to submission of an investigational device exemption to conduct a first-in-human clinical trial of SAS guided responsive AED therapy.

"An implantable device to predict and prevent seizures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): After the first four years of our Bioengineering Research Partnership, implantable devices for epilepsy are now a reality. This is due, in part, to translation of technology developed by our group to industry. Data from multi-center clinical trials of first generation responsive antiepileptic devices indicate that this new technology is safe, and that there is promise of significant benefit to patients.

This is because we do not yet understand when, where and how to deliver electrical stimulation to pre-empt seizures, or the mechanisms underlying seizure generation in epileptic networks.

(3) To develop more effective closed loop stimulation algorithms for controlling seizures. These Aims will be accomplished through a series of projects led by established collaborators in neurology, neuroscience, bioengineering and industry, at Penn, CHOP, Georgia Tech, and BioQuantix, Inc.

"Trainable Early Warning System for Epileptic Seizures DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Individuals with epilepsy, their families and the professionals that treat them have long felt the need for reliable warning of an impending epileptic seizure. In Phase I, we developed a unique, multi-parameter, individualized, trainable seizure predetection system which extracts spectral, wavelet and time domain features and uses recurrent neural networks to analyze many hours of multichannel EEG and predetect seizure onsets with a high level of accuracy and reliability. The underlying analytical software for this system was tested on large database of scalp EEG recordings from five epilepsy centers and contained over 373 hours of recordings from 17 patients containing 50 seizures. This is a large database compared to those reported by most investigators in this field. Phase I results were very accurate and reliable (sensitivity: 100%, false positive rate 0.02/hr and detection times that occurred an average of 9.1 seconds, before seizure onset). This is entirely acceptable for our primary target application, of warning of a seizure onset to enable timely diagnostic injection to locate the brain region where the seizure starts using SPECT imaging. In Phase II we will refine the detection process, validate performance in a large data set, implement the software in C++ modules, and test the commercial prototype in a clinical setting. These steps will result in a company supported Phase III product development, integration into existing EEG recording systems, beta testing and commercialization. While Phase 2 will concentrate on the SPECT application using scalp electrodes, the scalp EEG techniques developed will be applicable without change for general use in an epilepsy monitoring facility to alert staff of impending seizures and allow them to attend to patient safety in a timely manner. Predetection will also facilitate neuropsychological or other testing in the epilepsy monitoring environment.

"Analysis & Control of Non-Synaptic Epileptiform Activity   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is characterized by the abnormal       synchronization of large numbers of neurons. The synchronization and                 propagation of epileptic seizures are thought to rely on synaptic transmission.      However, non-synaptic mechanisms such as neuronal swelling, electric field           effects, potassium diffusion, gap junctions and glial cell function also             contribute to the generation and spread of epileptiform activity. Non-synaptic       epilepsy is generated by lowering calcium in the extracellular space thereby         eliminating synaptic transmission. As a result, the clinical relevance of            non-synaptic mechanisms has been questioned. We have recently generated novel        models of non-synaptic activity in the presence of normal calcium and normal         synaptic transmission. We propose to analyze the role of non-synaptic                mechanisms in neuronal synchronization in order to understand and potentially        develop novel therapies to prevent abnormal neural activity. We have recently        shown that the frequency, amplitude and duration of non-synaptic epileptiform        events can be controlled independently suggesting that different mechanisms are      responsible. In particular, preliminary experiments show that gap junctions are      not responsible for the propagation of non-synaptic events generated in              zero-calcium medium, but that potassium diffusion (potentially mediated by the       activity of glial cells) plays a crucial role. The goal of this proposal is to       analyze and control non-synaptic epileptiform activity.                                                                                                                   Specifically, we propose to 1) determine the common mechanisms underlying three      models of non-synaptic epilepsy, 2) establish the conditions sufficient for the      generation of non-synaptic epileptogenesis, 3) analyze the mechanisms                underlying the propagation of non-synaptic epileptiform activity, 4) develop a       computer model of non-synaptic propagation to test hypotheses not directly           testable by experimentation, and 5) develop methods for controlling                  epileptiform activity. Multi-disciplinary experimental approaches such as            computer simulation and fluorescence imaging will be combined with pharmacology      and in-vitro slice electrophysiology to achieve these goals. Current                 therapeutic agents are not capable of controlling seizure activity in 25             percent of all epileptic patients. The results of our studies should provide         valuable insight into mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis as well as new           tools for the control and suppression of epileptic seizures.                                                                                                              n/a",Analysis & Control of Non-Synaptic Epileptiform Activity,6793142,R01NS040785,"['Animalia', 'artificial intelligence', 'brain electrical activity', 'cadmium', 'calcium', 'calcium channel', 'computer simulation', 'epilepsy', 'gap junctions', 'hippocampus', 'magnesium', 'model design /development', 'neuropharmacology', 'veratrum alkaloid', 'voltage /patch clamp']",NINDS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,229500,0.13371049069308644
"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming. While significant progress has been made in the automated            detection of seizures in the adult population, relatively little work has been       done in the neonatal area. Therefore, the major objective of this project is         the development of techniques for the reliable automated detection of                electrographic seizures in the neonatal EEG. We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures.

"Analysis & Control of Non-Synaptic Epileptiform Activity   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is characterized by the abnormal       synchronization of large numbers of neurons. The synchronization and                 propagation of epileptic seizures are thought to rely on synaptic transmission.      However, non-synaptic mechanisms such as neuronal swelling, electric field           effects, potassium diffusion, gap junctions and glial cell function also             contribute to the generation and spread of epileptiform activity. Non-synaptic       epilepsy is generated by lowering calcium in the extracellular space thereby         eliminating synaptic transmission. As a result, the clinical relevance of            non-synaptic mechanisms has been questioned. We have recently generated novel        models of non-synaptic activity in the presence of normal calcium and normal         synaptic transmission. We propose to analyze the role of non-synaptic                mechanisms in neuronal synchronization in order to understand and potentially        develop novel therapies to prevent abnormal neural activity. We have recently        shown that the frequency, amplitude and duration of non-synaptic epileptiform        events can be controlled independently suggesting that different mechanisms are      responsible. In particular, preliminary experiments show that gap junctions are      not responsible for the propagation of non-synaptic events generated in              zero-calcium medium, but that potassium diffusion (potentially mediated by the       activity of glial cells) plays a crucial role. The goal of this proposal is to       analyze and control non-synaptic epileptiform activity.

"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming.

"Continuous Digital Video Behavioral Analysis of Rats  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The behavioral components of electrographic seizures in rodents, primarily rats and mice, are generally used as the most fundamental basis for the presence of epileptic seizures. Numerous research grants use analysis of animal seizures as a fundamental component of the research, even research aimed at molecular and cellular mechanisms. The abnormal behaviors during a motor seizure are generally distinctive, but a certain degree of subjectivity is present from one laboratory to another. With the development of sophisticated electrodes for multiple recordings and the availability of radiotelemetry systems, the potential to combine automated studies of seizure behavior and electrographic seizure activity is now possible. We propose to develop and validate behavioral algorithms for identifying, classifying and quantifying the motor components of different types of seizures in mice and rats using digital video technology. We will define the behavioral components of different classes of seizures, and to do this in conjunction with electrographic seizures from EEG recordings. These behaviors will include but not be limited to unilateral and bilateral forelimb clonus and the assumption of a lordotic posture, with a characteristic positioning of the tail. A system that allows combined analysis of EEG and behavior will be fully developed to meet the demand from research laboratories at universities and pharmaceutical companies.   n/a",Continuous Digital Video Behavioral Analysis of Rats,6549823,R43DA015571,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' body movement', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' digital imaging', ' drug addiction', ' electron optics', ' ethology', ' laboratory rat', ' nicotine', ' posture', ' psychometrics', ' self medication', ' video recording system', ' videotape /videodisc']",NIDA,"CLEVER SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2002,113671,0.23850769137929045

"Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Despite the widespread adoption of new drug classes to treat epilepsy, approximately one third of patients do not respond to anti-epileptic medication. Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) suffer permanent memory and cognitive impairment from uncontrolled seizures. Only 8-10% of patients with DRE obtain long-term seizure freedom. About half of patients with DRE are eligible for surgical treatment, which results in seizure freedom in 58-73% of patients. However, it is difficult to determine when patients with DRE need surgery. DRE has a complex disease course that fluctuates according to weekly and monthly patterns. Further, neurologists report that they lack the resources (i.e. time) needed to analyze and interpret large amounts of electronic health record (EHR) data to determine surgical candidacy. This results in substantial delays in treatment - 6 years in pediatrics and 20 years in adults, on average - and contributes to avoidable morbidity and mortality. Automated systems are capable of assisting clinicians in identifying candidates for epilepsy surgery two years earlier in the disease course. One such system uses natural language processing to analyze free-text neurology notes in a real-time clinical setting. This system was able to increase the rate of surgical candidate identification by 46%, but it could still be improved in two important ways. First, the system is not able to incorporate results from EEG and MRIs - the most influential factors on surgical candidacy - into its recommendations. Second, it does not utilize rich information hidden in structured EHR data that captures epilepsy disease burden. A system that fuses information from all three data sources (neurology notes, EEG and MRI reports, and structured data) would drastically improve the accuracy and impact of the model. In the proposed research, I will first develop a deep learning (DL) approach for fusing multi-modal EHR data. Specifically, I will use recent advances in deep representation learning to produce richer features from both free- text and structured data. I will represent free-text in neurology notes and EEG and MRI reports with word embedding vectors, and medication, procedure, and visit codes with medical concept vectors. I will combine disparate data sources with a deep neural network to produce high-level representations of surgical candidacy. This will enable me to estimate patients' risk of future epilepsy surgery. Second, I will establish the generalizability of this approach using a neighboring hospital's EHR data and validate the system in a clinical setting. This contribution will be significant because it will increase the number of surgical candidates identified earlier in the disease course, thereby reducing epilepsy disease sequelae. This proposal will lay the groundwork for nationwide expansion of the DL system and generate the only automated DL system designed to improve the timeliness of surgical referral rates in the adult population. Project Narrative Automating the identification of patients with epilepsy who would benefit from surgical treatment is imperative to reducing morbidity and mortality from uncontrolled seizures. This research proposal will develop and clinically validate a generalizable deep learning framework for analyzing multi-modal electronic health record data to predict epilepsy surgery candidacy. Implementing this system into clinical care is expected to reduce the time to surgery by 45%, which would prevent one epilepsy-related death for every 58 patients who receive surgery.",Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery,10066989,F31NS115447,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'ROC Curve', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Schedule', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'candidate identification', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'structured data', 'tool', 'vector']",NINDS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,F31,2020,39617,0.08554461632143272
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy The research objective of this proposal, Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy Prediction, with Pl Dominique Duncan from the University of Southern California, is to predict the onset of epileptic seizures following traumatic brain injury (TBI), using innovative analytic tools from machine learning and applied mathematics to identify features of epileptiform activity, from a multimodal dataset collected from both an animal model and human patients. The proposed research will accelerate the discovery of salient and robust features of epileptogenesis following TBI from a rich dataset, collected from the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx), as it is being acquired by investigating state-of-the-art models, methods, and algorithms from contemporary machine learning theory. This secondary use of data to support automated discovery of reliable knowledge from aggregated records of animal model and human patient data will lead to innovative models to predict post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). This machine learning based investigation of a rich dataset complements ongoing data acquisition and classical biostatistics-based analyses ongoing in the study and can lead to rigorous outcomes for the development of antiepileptogenic therapies, which can prevent this disease. Identifying salient features in time series and images to help design a predictor of PTE using data from two species and multiple individuals with heterogeneous TBI conditions presents significant theoretical challenges that need to be tackled. In this project, it is proposed to adopt transfer learning and domain adaptation perspectives to accomplish these goals in multimodal biomedical datasets across two populations. Specifically, techniques emerging from d,eep learning literature will be exploited to augment data, share parameters across model components to reduce the number of parameters that need to be optimized, and use state-of-the-art architectures to develop models for feature extraction. These will be compared against established pipelines of hand-crafted feature extraction in rigorous cross-validation analyses. Developed techniques for transfer learning will be able to extract features that generalize across animal and human data. Moreover, these theoretical techniques with associated models and optimization methods will be applicable to other multi-species transfer learning challenges that may arise in the context of health and medicine. Multimodal feature extraction and discriminative model learning for disease onset prediction using novel classifiers also offer insights into biomarker discovery using advanced machine learning techniques through joint multimodal data analysis. A significant percentage of people develop epilepsy after a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury. If we can identify who will develop post-traumatic epilepsy and at what time point after the injury, those patients can be treated with antiepileptogenic therapies and medications to stop or prevent the seizures from occurring. It is likely that biomarkers of epileptogenesis after TBI can only be found by analyzing multimodal data from a large population, which requires advanced mathematical tools and models.",SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy,9921505,R01NS111744,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antiepileptogenic', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Limbic System', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Epilepsy', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Rattus', 'Records', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Voting', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'animal data', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'data acquisition', 'data fusion', 'deep learning', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'human data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'laboratory experiment', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'post-trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'support vector machine', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,245552,0.1184077936006875
"Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Neurosurgical therapy of refractory epilepsy requires accurate localization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). In clinical practice, intracranial EEG (iEEG) is recorded in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) over many days where multiple seizures are recorded to provide information to localize the SOZ. The prolonged monitoring in the EMU adds to the risk of complications and can include intracranial bleeding and potentially death. Recently, high frequency oscillations (HFO) of iEEG between 80 to 500 Hz are highly valued as a promising clinical biomarker for epilepsy. HFOs are believed to be clinically significant, and thus could be used for SOZ localization. However, HFOs can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, pathological HFOs are indistinguishable from physiological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy pre-surgical planning. In this proposal, to the best of our knowledge, we show of a recurrent waveform pattern that distinguishes pathological HFOs from physiological ones. In particular, we observed that the SOZ generates repeatedly a set of stereotyped HFO waveforms whereas the HFOs from nonepileptic regions were irregular in their waveform morphology. Based on these observations, using computational tools built on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we propose to detect these stereotyped recurrent HFO waveform patterns directly from the continuous iEEG data of adult and pediatric patients and test their prognostic value by correlating the spatial distribution of detected events to clinical findings such as SOZ, resection zone and seizure freedom. We hypothesize that accurate detection of pathologic HFOs in brief iEEG recordings can identify the SOZ and eliminate the necessity of prolonged EMU monitoring and reduce the associated risks. With these motivations, in this project an interdisciplinary team composed of biomedical engineers, epileptologists and neurosurgeons will work together to develop and test novel computational tools to detect stereotyped HFOs and its subtypes in large iEEG datasets recorded with clinical electrodes. Developed algorithms and iEEG data will be shared with the research community to contribute to the reproducible research and help other research groups to develop novel methods. The results of this study will be essential for achieving our group's long term goal of developing an online neural signal processing system for the rapid and accurate identification of SOZ with brief invasive recording. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prolonged iEEG monitoring for SOZ localization does add to the risk of complications and may include serious issues, such as intracranial bleeding, meningoencephalitis, and eventually death. The intellectual merit of this project is to develop computational intelligence tools based on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques to investigate stereotyped high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in long-term iEEG and test the hypothesis whether the automated detection of HFOs will yield accurate and fast identification of SOZ.",Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy,9974350,R01NS112497,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Meningoencephalitis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neocortex', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Visual', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'computational intelligence', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'signal processing', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2020,459252,0.2186198318957131
"Model Development for Prediction of Surgical Outcome in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients: Incorporation of the Correlation between Post-Surgical Reorganization Phenotypes and Pre-Surgical Data Project Summary For epileptic patients who undergo brain resection or ablation interventions, it is the postoperative brain that will dictate seizure status, whether controlled or relapsed. Yet, it is data from the preoperative brain that drives the postoperative prediction process – a critical process for both patient and doctor, and one that is only clinically meaningful when seizure outcomes are predicted presurgically to optimize surgical-decision making. Accordingly, we propose to develop a multi-step model that will establish more accurate predictors of post- surgical seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) emphasizing post-surgical status, for it is the areas of the brain spared during surgery that form the neural substrates generating postoperative seizures. A second perspective motivating our project is the need to identify those changes in functional and structural brain network organization that support adaptive versus maladaptive seizure outcomes following brain surgery. These are the network changes (e.g., the new seizure generators) that dispose and place a potential surgical candidate on a specific outcome trajectory. Therefore, identifying the phenotypes of brain reorganization and change, and incorporating their status into presurgical predictive models of outcome will likely prove crucial to enhancing our ability to predict postoperative neuroplastic responses. While existing outcome prediction models in TLE have focused on clinical variables (e.g., lesional status), we choose instead to focus on structural and functional measures of network reorganization (communication dynamics, regional interactions, structural control). This stems from our belief that capturing network changes throughout the whole postsurgical brain offers a better practical method for identifying and predicting the latent seizure foci (epileptogenesis) that will emerge after surgery. Through machine learning techniques we will deliver an algorithm to be used with new, potential surgical patients, an algorithm that utilizes solely presurgical data, but incorporates our innovative prediction about postsurgical brain organization. Accordingly, our approach provides both a methodologic and conceptual (reorganization phenotypes) advance. The scientific premise leading to our hypotheses is that the failure in the literature to account for the impact of unresected/ablated brain regions, and the brain reorganizations these areas compel, has seriously impeded the predictive power of previous outcome models. Project Narrative For epileptic patients undergoing brain surgery, it is the postoperative brain that will dictate whether seizures are controlled or not. Accordingly, we propose to develop a model that predicts post-surgical seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy, emphasizing the reorganization and change in brain network communication and control that comes with post-surgical status, for it is these features that will actually generate postsurgical seizures. Our innovation is the use of post-operative brain reorganization phenotypes to predict on a presurgical basis who will be disposed to a good vs poor outcome trajectory, highlighting that it is the failure to account for the impact of spared regions, and the brain organization changes these compel, which has seriously impeded the predictive power of prior outcome models.",Model Development for Prediction of Surgical Outcome in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients: Incorporation of the Correlation between Post-Surgical Reorganization Phenotypes and Pre-Surgical Data,9966055,R01NS112816,"['Ablation', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Freedom', 'Generalized Epilepsy', 'Health Personnel', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organizational Change', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Thalamic structure', 'Work', 'base', 'brain surgery', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standard measure', 'stem', 'surgery outcome']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,442761,0.18731470954836824
"Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Epilepsy is the world’s most prominent serious brain disorder, affecting nearly 50 million people worldwide. For about 30% of these patients, seizures remain poorly controlled despite optimal medical management, with attendant effects on health and quality of life. In order to enable advances in the therapeutic management of epilepsy, a thorough understanding of how cellular processes that drive seizures are linked to large-scale network effects is needed. While seizures impact large brain areas and often multiple lobes, the driving processes span regions on the scale of millimeters. These have been well characterized in animal models, but the relevance to human seizures, i.e. how seizures are driven by brain signals from small-scale processes remains unclear. Instead, the view that naturally-occurring seizures may be attributable instead to large-scale neural mass effects (i.e., the epileptic network) is a subject of ongoing debate. Previously, we defined a key role for surround inhibition in shaping EEG recordings of seizures at the onset site and on small spatial scales. We now propose that surround inhibition has a dual role. On a millimeter scale, its abrupt failure permits the advance of a seizure. At long distances from the seizure focus, strong local inhibition serves to mask the excitatory effects of seizures and may help to hasten seizure termination, while weakened inhibition may permit emergence of ictal activity at a distant, noncontiguous seizure site. Multiple seizure foci may go unrecognized with standard EEG interpretation methods, and are likely a critical factor in epilepsy surgery failures. We hypothesize that once established, multiple ictal generators behave as delay-coupled oscillators, demonstrating activity that is synchronized or even temporally reversed. This results in complex and at times counterintuitive network behavior that can be challenging to reverse engineer from EEG recordings. Typically, however, even intracranial EEG recordings provide only a limited view of neural activity. In this project, an interdisciplinary research group with combined expertise in epilepsy, clinical neurophysiology, computational modeling, and mathematics will conduct a comprehensive study of the neuronal contributors to epileptic networks utilizing a unique combined dataset of simultaneous microelectrode and macroelectrode recordings of human seizures. Using a machine learning approach, we will apply this information to develop a multivariate EEG biomarker based on the inferred source of EEG discharges, high frequency oscillations, and very low frequency (DC) shifts and assess its predictive value for post-resection surgical outcome. We anticipate that the project will lead to a theoretical framework for rational development of innovative strategies for developing interventions to control seizures. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to identify the cellular mechanisms of epileptic networks, a critical barrier to developing treatments based on epileptic network analysis and manipulation. An interdisciplinary team of researchers will address this problem by analyzing and modeling multiscale voltage data from epilepsy patients, and utilizing the results to develop a new multivariate biomarker for seizure-generating brain areas.",Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy,9972766,R01NS084142,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Focal Seizure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Human', 'Impact Seizures', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lobe', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'millimeter', 'minimally invasive', 'multi-scale modeling', 'neurophysiology', 'parallel computer', 'relating to nervous system', 'support vector machine', 'surgery outcome', 'voltage']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,615913,0.3460073549234496
"Post-surgical resection mapping in epilepsy using convolutional neural networks Project Summary Approximately one third of all individuals with epilepsy continue to have seizures despite treatment with anti- seizure medications. For these people, surgical removal of brain tissue can be a highly effective intervention to reduce or stop seizures. However, there is considerably variability in post-surgical seizure outcomes among individual patients, and the ability of physicians to predict who will benefit from surgery is limited. The location and extent of removed tissue, as well as neuroanatomical structures that are not surgically removed, are important factors that contribute to post-surgical outcomes. The goal of this proposal is to use convolutional neural networks, also known as deep learning, to map both the location and extent of surgically removed tissue on postsurgical MRI scans. The technique will also be used to automatically label brain regions that are spared during the surgical procedure. These computational tools will allow researchers to develop improved methods to predict postsurgical health outcomes. We will develop the automated method by training convolutional neural networks to identify brain regions on MRI scans obtained after epilepsy surgery at the New York University Langone Medical Center. CNNs have been specifically designed for the identification of complex spatial patterns in images and are likely to be well-suited to the identifications of changes in the brain following surgery. Recent developments in computer hardware and analysis methods mean that CNNs can now be applied to high resolution three-dimensional MRI scans. This project will leverage these recent developments in computational image analysis to improve our ability to predict outcomes following epilepsy surgery and therefore contribute to improved treatment for epilepsy patients. Project Narrative This project will use recently developed computational deep learning methods to identify neuroanatomical changes in individuals who have undergone brain surgery for treatment of medically refractory epilepsy.

"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will develop breakthrough technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in preclinical epilepsy research. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on epilepsy research by enabling investigators to perform objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epilepsy in experimental animals to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,10024094,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Body part', 'Cannabidiol', 'Carbamazepine', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clonazepam', 'Clonus', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Face', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phenytoin', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Specificity', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Valproic Acid', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'comorbidity', 'drug use screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'method development', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'selective expression', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,422740,0.2396113470157809
"Tracking pre-seizure dynamics to predict and control seizures Epileptic seizures are unpredictable events that significantly reduce quality of life. Predicting when the next seizure would occur could both prepare persons with epilepsy and their caregivers, and potentially aid in the treatment of seizures. Animal models of epilepsy provide an opportunity to explore the nature of brain activity in the period leading up to seizures. Using both mouse and rat models of generalized absence epilepsy, we have found a specific build up of thalamic neural spiking activity for several seconds before each seizure. This novel electrophysiological signature occurs in the absence of any overt epileptiform EEG activity. We propose to identify the neural circuits that are responsible for pre-seizure activity using high-density multi-channel silicon probes to record broadly across seizure-generating networks in the mouse. We will also measure calcium ion levels, a readout of neural activity, in neuronal cell bodies and their output axons using fluorescent calcium indicators (GCaMPs) and multiphoton microscopy to capture a highly complementary component of pre-seizure activity with high spatial resolution. Neural activity data will be collected together with EEG, locomotion signals, sensory-evoked responses, and pupil diameter to create a comprehensive multimodal stream of pre-seizure activity. This information will be fed into unbiased machine learning approaches to develop predictive algorithms. We will directly test coupling strength within thalamocortical pre-seizure networks by conducting network-level and targeted single-cell recordings in acute brain slices. To determine a specific role of pre- seizure networks in generating seizures, we will test whether chemogenetic or optogenetic silencing of key pre-seizure network elements reduces seizure incidence or severity. Finally, we will test whether we can use seizure-predictive signals to intervene in real-time and prevent seizures before they take hold. Together, these experiments will provide proof of concept for a novel therapeutic approach: targeting the pre-seizure state to improve seizure control. The unpredictable nature of seizures is a burden on persons with epilepsy and their caregivers. Using animal models of absence epilepsy, we propose to test new methods for a) predicting when the next seizure will occur and b) using this information to prevent seizures from occurring.",Tracking pre-seizure dynamics to predict and control seizures,10122043,R01NS117150,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Calcium ion', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clozapine', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Dissection', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Activity', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Oxides', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'Quality of life', 'Rattus', 'Resolution', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'SCN8A gene', 'Seizures', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Slice', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Nuclei', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Virus', 'awake', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'density', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo two-photon imaging', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'optogenetics', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,424537,0.32745982989122335
"Title: Neurobiology of seizure generalization during electroconvulsive therapy for major depression PROJECT SUMMARY Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for severe depression and other mental health conditions, yet how ECT changes the brain to ameliorate the symptoms of depression is not well understood. Seizure generalization appears to be critical for successful antidepressant response to ECT, and stimulation dose is adjusted to ensure an “adequate” seizure. Previous studies have linked seizure generalization during ECT with thalamocortical regions, and our own MRI studies indicate that thalamocortical networks exhibit neuroplasticity after treatment in patients who respond to ECT. Yet, despite recent growth in the number of MRI studies measuring long-term neuroplasticity across ECT sessions, relatively less is known about the neurobiology of seizure activity elicited during each session. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to understand how ECT-induced seizures change brain networks to treat depression. To address this goal, we will take a data-driven, machine learning approach to pre-existing ECT-MRI datasets of patients with depression, to identify the neurobiological features measured with MRI (functional connectivity, gray-matter morphometry, electric fields) that optimally explain inter-patient variability in seizure indicators (seizure duration and stimulation dose). Aim 1 will identify biomarkers of susceptibility to ECT-induced seizures by analyzing pre-treatment MRI with respect to initial stimulation dose and seizure duration. Aim 2 studies will determine how brain network plasticity over the course of ECT relates to changes in stimulation dose and duration of ECT-induced seizures. These studies will further our understanding of therapeutic seizures in ECT, potentially facilitating prediction of optimal dose and/or treatment outcome to improve ECT and minimize side effects.

"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy. The quantitative nature of our acquisition/analysis methods also makes it possible to be uniformly adopted by other centers with high consistency.

"Epilepsy Multiplatform Variant Prediction (EpiMVP) The advent of next generation DNA sequencing has revolutionized gene discovery in human diseases, including epilepsy. Hundreds of genes have been implicated in epilepsy in the last decade, revealing the diversity of biological mechanisms that can go awry in this disorder. However, the rate at which we are identifying new genes involved in epilepsy is now outpacing our ability to study disease mechanisms. Moreover, clinical gene panel or exome sequencing has become standard practice for patients with early-onset, familial, and refractory epilepsies. This rapid assimilation of genetic testing into clinical care has led to a surge in the number of genetic variants of uncertain significance (VUS), particularly the occurrence of missense VUS. These VUS are assigned to an indeterminate spectrum between pathogenic and benign, which complicate interpretation for genetic counselors, clinicians, patients and families, as well as assessment of the need for further testing. Here we propose a Center without Walls, entitled Epilepsy Multiplatform Variant Prediction (EpiMVP), spanning 5 institutions and incorporating expertise from geneticists, clinicians, computational biologists, neuroscientists, stem cell biologists, pharmacologists and electrophysiologists who have a proven track record of collaborative publications and grants, as well as stature as leaders of national and international epilepsy organizations. EpiMVP will develop a modular, highly integrated platform approach to accelerate determination of the functional, pharmacological, neuronal network and whole animal consequences of genetic variants implicated in a range of clinical epilepsy types. We will study non-ion-channel, non-receptor genes commonly implicated in epilepsy, and that are involved in diverse biological processes. Our ultimate goals are to devise an effective experimental platform for testing the pathogenicity of VUS in genes implicated in epilepsy and to generate a computational model (EpiPred) that predicts the likelihood that a variant is pathogenic or benign. This work is crucial in the pursuit of novel therapeutics and the promise of personalized medicine. The overall milestones of the Center are: 1. Evaluate genes associated with epilepsy and select candidates for analysis, model data for, and analyze all project data for development of EpiPred an iterative machine learning model to classify variants in genes implicated in epilepsy. 2. Test selected VUS using medium throughput, in vitro approaches. 3. Test selected VUS in human cortical neurons or human brain organoids using induced pluripotent stem cell approaches. 4. Test selected VUS in pre-clinical, in vivo models. The expected outcomes are: 1. Provide a freely available prediction tool for clinicians to differentiate between pathogenic and benign variants for genes implicated in epilepsy; 2. Provide experimental models to study the functional consequences of specific variants; 3. Provide a reclassification of VUS in ClinVar/ClinGen and to develop new guidelines for incorporating functional readouts into the ACMG criteria; 4. Inform the future development of novel therapeutics to treat epilepsy.

"EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy Project Summary Dr. Jennifer A. Kim is a critical care neurologist and neuroscientist at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently funded translational investigator with expertise in signal processing of neurophysiologic and neuroimaging data to identify early biomarkers of secondary brain injury in critically ill patients, particularly related to post-traumatic epilepsy. Post-traumatic epilepsy is a disabling complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is an urgent need to find biomarkers of post-traumatic epilepsy to identify patients at high risk for developing this complication. It is a population in which early biomarker identification could improve patient monitoring and ultimately treatment development to circumvent epileptogenesis. Post- traumatic epilepsy contributes to worsening of the already high rates of TBI morbidity, disability and cost of care, thus emphasizing the importance of preventing this complication. We need to find biomarkers to best define those most likely to benefit from potential treatments and make such treatment discovery trials more feasible. During the proposed training period, the candidate will expand upon her knowledge of EEG signal processing and machine learning techniques and acquire new skills in neuroimaging analysis using Magnetic Resonance technologies and biostatistics. To accomplish this, Dr. Kim has brought together a strong mentorship team of Dr. Hal Blumenfeld (primary mentor) and co-mentors Drs. Todd Constable, Brandon Westover and Brian Edlow who have expertise in multi-modal approaches to studying epilepsy, functional MRI analysis, computational EEG analysis and structural TBI imaging, respectively. Under their mentorship, Dr. Kim proposes to: 1) quantify epileptiform abnormality (EA) frequency and identify EA waveform features that optimally predict PTE, 2) determine if direct hippocampal injury, assessed by cortical thickness and contusion volume, stratifies PTE risk 3) assess whether indirect hippocampal injury, based on structural and functional MRI connectivity analyses, portend PTE. The overall goal is to identify early biomarkers of patients at high risk for post-traumatic epilepsy to target development of anti-epileptogenesis treatments. Bringing together advanced neurophysiologic and neuroimaging analysis and this strong mentorship support, this project opens new avenues for optimizing follow-up care and advancing potential treatment development for all traumatic brain injury patients at risk for post-traumatic epilepsy. This well-defined patient-oriented research proposal, in concert with the mentorship and structured didactic curriculum, will provide Dr. Kim with the skills that are essential to develop an independent career in neurophysiological and neuroimaging research that translates to improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Post-traumatic epilepsy, a seizure disorder secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI), is among the most disabling and difficult-to-treat complications of TBI. Currently, there are no tools to identify patients a priori at highest risk for PTE. Dr. Kim's proposed career development plan has great potential to advance our knowledge of the acute biomarkers of PTE using EEG and MRI, to improve early identification and ultimately provide treatment options for this potentially preventable complication.",EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy,10055272,K23NS112596,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptogenic', 'Atrophic', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blinded', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Complication', 'Contusions', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Epilepsy', 'Prevention trial', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Rodent Model', 'Sclerosis', 'Secondary to', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'TBI Patients', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'care costs', 'career', 'career development', 'cost estimate', 'didactic education', 'disability', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'human imaging', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'preventable epilepsy', 'prospective', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,192780,0.09207916720690208
"Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data Abstract Eysz, Inc. is developing an algorithm and software solutions to reliably and affordably detect seizures in an ambulatory setting using existing smart glass technologies. In a proof-of-concept study, Eysz was able to detect >75% of all absence seizures longer than 10 s in duration using only oculometric variables (e.g., pupil size, pupil location, eccentricity, blink frequency) detected using off-the-shelf eye-tracking technology. Eysz seeks to build on this finding by developing and commercializing highly sensitive and specific seizure detection algorithms using eye-movement data as input, with eventual expansion to additional seizure types. This technology has the potential to transform the detection and treatment of seizures for those with epilepsy, one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Timely treatment can reduce the chance of additional seizures by half, making early detection and treatment critical. Unfortunately, detection and diagnosis can be difficult using current technologies, especially in types of epilepsy with few observable symptoms such as absence seizures. The gold standard for detecting and characterizing seizure activity is electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring with video and subsequent review by a trained clinician, but this does not translate well to the outpatient setting. While attempts to develop ambulatory EEGs have been made, these have significant drawbacks, including poor patient acceptability, poor detection capability, and continued reliance on asynchronous review. Additional non-EEG- based motion detection devices are limited to tonic-clonic seizures, which are responsible for a small fraction of all seizure activity. Thus, there is a critical need to reliably detect seizures outside of the clinic to provide physicians with necessary information to guide therapeutic decision making. To address this need, Eysz is developing a digital health platform that leverages existing eye tracking technology to meet this significant unmet gap in the market and is technically feasible, capital-efficient, robust, and innovative. Eysz plans to use existing smart glass technology to export the necessary oculometric data to be analyzed by our seizure detection algorithm. We will also build out databases, software systems, and user interfaces enabling the resulting data to be stored in the cloud and visualized/analyzed by physicians. In this Phase I SBIR, Eysz will advance the development of the seizure detection algorithms by: 1) obtaining oculometric video and EEG data on ≥100 absence seizures from multiple patients, and 2) using ML and statistical methods to optimize an algorithm for identifying absence seizures using eye-tracking data, with a target sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90%. Lessons learned from this study will be applied (with different training sets) to additional seizures types, such as focal impaired awareness (formerly called complex partial) seizures, the most prevalent seizure type in adults. This work is of critical importance to the field, as demonstrated by support from the Epilepsy Foundation and receipt of both the judges' and people's choice awards in the Epilepsy Foundation's 8th Annual Shark Tank Competition. Narrative More than 70 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a debilitating, unpredictable chronic condition that results in significant disability and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Seizure detection and characterization is critical to choosing an appropriate treatment regimen, and appropriate anticonvulsants can decrease seizures by 50%. Eysz's proposed seizure detection solution will provide unobtrusive, objective, automated detection of seizure activity in an outpatient setting in near real time, improving medical decision- making, decreasing time to treatment, reducing mortality, and ultimately improving quality of life for those with epilepsy.",Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data,10153499,R43NS119015,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Blinking', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Epilepsy', 'Eye Movements', 'Focal Seizure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Glass', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pupil', 'Quality of life', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Shark', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tonic - clonic seizures', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'commercialization', 'digital', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'premature', 'prospective', 'software systems', 'statistical and machine learning', 'visual tracking', 'wearable device']",NINDS,"EYSZ, INC.",R43,2020,511154,0.3310254243606786
"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled. PROJECT NARRATIVE The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques as well as automatic clustering approaches based on quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution.

"Stress-Induced Hormonal Fluctuations and their Relation to Seizure Dynamics in Children with Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the new era of personalized medicine, the epilepsy field is at a tipping point to leverage emerging therapies that can being tailored to individual patient characteristics. Over 30% of children with epilepsy suffer from seizures that cannot be managed by mono- or poly-pharmacotherapies. Targeted neurostimulation and drug delivery are promising alternative therapies but, given the complexity and heterogeneity of the disorder, these therapies need to be precisely guided by the patient’s seizure dynamics. Despite decades of basic and clinical research, the latter remain elusive. In particular, seizure evolution from ictogenesis to ictal onset is poorly understood, in part due to a lack of fundamental understanding of how seizure precipitants impact the brain’s neurophysiological equilibrium, trigger ictogenesis and lead to cumulative changes that facilitate ictal onset. Although the underlying mechanisms of action of common precipitants such as stress and sleep loss are unclear, there is substantial evidence that they may modulate various hormones and neurotransmitters that impact the brain’s excitability and/or balance between excitation and inhibition. This project aims to systematically investigate the impact of large-scale hormonal fluctuations in pediatric epilepsy patients on brain dynamics, and quantify localized and distributed (network-level) electrophysiological changes during seizure evolution. Specifically, in a cohort of n = 40 patients with focal epilepsy who are undergoing continuous noninvasive neurophysiological monitoring as part of their presurgical evaluation, salivary cortisol and catecholamines will be measured 8 times daily, across all study days (Aim 1). Continuous scalp electroncephalograms (EEG) collected during this period will be analyzed in their entirety at the signal and network levels (Aim 2). Pathological high-frequency oscillations, a promising precursor of seizure activity in the epileptic brain will be estimated and classified across the entire period of recording. Multiscale brain networks and their topological properties will be quantified across all dominant frequencies of continuous EEG signals, and their time-dependent seizure sensitivity and specificity will be assessed. Statistical models will be developed to evaluate the relation between each patient-specific circadian hormone rhythms and corresponding temporal patterns of estimated electrophysiological measures, individually and combined into a seizure risk score (Aim 3). This is a first of its kind study that may significantly improve the field’s understanding of the direct and indirect (through hormonal modulations) impact of seizure precipitants, such as stress, on seizure dynamics from ictogenesis to ictal onset. This new knowledge may have a significant impact on the development of next-generation therapies that need to be guided by patient-specific seizure dynamics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Through repeated hormone measurements and continuous electrophysiological (scalp EEG data), this project aims to systematically investigate the impact of (predominantly stress-related) hormonal fluctuations on the pediatric epileptic brain and their relationships to seizure evolution, from ictogenesis to ictal onset. The overarching goal of the study is to improve the field’s fundamental understanding of mechanisms underlying electrophysiological changes in the epileptic brain that favor seizure generation. In turn, this knowledge may have a transformative impact on promising next- generation individualized therapies for patients with medically refractory epilepsy.",Stress-Induced Hormonal Fluctuations and their Relation to Seizure Dynamics in Children with Epilepsy,10105451,R03NS119799,"['Alternative Therapies', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Catecholamines', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Endogenous Factors', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Epinephrine', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hormonal', 'Hormonal Change', 'Hormones', 'Hour', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impact Seizures', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Menstruation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Polynomial Models', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'ROC Curve', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Salivary', 'Salvelinus', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'childhood epilepsy', 'circadian', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'curve fitting', 'effective therapy', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning network', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'signal processing', 'targeted treatment', 'time use']",NINDS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R03,2020,177000,0.3051384409116474
"Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture Abstract Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common forms of pharmacologically resistant epilepsy. The resection or ablation of medial temporal structures can be curative for many patients. Unfortunately, approximately one third of patients who undergo TLE surgery continue to have disabling seizures post- procedurally. The reasons for suboptimal outcomes are not well understood and therefore constitute a very important knowledge gap in epilepsy care. A better understanding of this difference in surgical response phenotype could be used to improve surgical planning, treatment, outcome prediction and counseling. Promising preliminary studies suggest that TLE surgical outcomes can be inferred by neuroimaging computational tools assessing the cumulative degree of abnormalities in the topological organization of structural networks involving limbic and extra-limbic regions. Nonetheless, network abnormalities are not routinely or systematically used and quantified in the pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsies, and their assessment requires refinement and further validation. The purpose of this proposal is to perform a prospective study to test the hypothesis that the degree of limbic and extra-limbic network abnormalities in TLE, systematically assessed using a connectome approach based on optimized diffusion MRI (dMRI), can be used to predict and better understand epilepsy surgery outcomes. This hypothesis builds on the well-defined basic science and neurobiological premises that epilepsy is associated with pathological alterations in networks that are related to seizure onset and seizure propagation. Importantly, network abnormalities are not visible on routine MRI, but their detection using connectomes constitutes a modern approach to quantifying the location and magnitude of “lesional epilepsy,” where broad computational network abnormalities imply worse outcomes. We will prospectively gather clinical and imaging data at six epilepsy centers using the NIH epilepsy common data elements. This project will be fundamentally based on standard of care data, thus minimizing the burden of extra data collection and ensuring feasibility. Furthermore, this project will be embedded in the ENIGMA-Epilepsy framework, which is a collaborative platform for clinical and neuromaging multi-center research. Specific Aim 1 will define the accuracy, reproducibility, and predictive values of the pre-surgical dMRI tractography connectome model towards surgical results in TLE. We will perform hypothesis-driven tests of specific limbic and extra-limbic networks in relationship with clinical data and surgical outcomes. Specific Aim 2 will test if the neuroimaging-clinical outcome model can be further improved with advanced diffusion methods (multi-shell diffusional kurtosis imaging), resting state functional MRI networks, or a multimodal approach. We believe that this research will have an important impact on our understanding of the mechanisms related to TLE treatment. NARRATIVE While some patients can become seizure free with epilepsy surgery, others persist with disabling seizures and the reasons for vastly dissimilar outcomes are not well understood. Increasing evidence suggests that epilepsy-related neuronal network reorganization is at the core of the mechanisms underlying epilepsy severity and seizure control. This project will use individualized mapping of white matter neural networks to better understand the pathophysiology of epilepsy, identify reasons for treatment success, and guide strategies to improve surgical treatment.",Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture,9994414,R01NS110347,"['Ablation', 'Anterior Temporal Lobectomy', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Common Data Element', 'Contralateral', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electrocoagulation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Freedom', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Publishing', 'Refractory', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'millimeter', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel strategies', 'organizational structure', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tractography', 'white matter']",NINDS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2020,646134,0.21201473744258997
