"Generalizing Deep Learning Reconstruction for Free-Breathing and Quantitative MRI Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this project is to increase the precision and resolution of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Quantitative information such as tissue relaxation parameters (e.g., T1 and T2) measure tissue function and indicate disease-related changes in the heart, liver, brain, and other organs. For instance, T1 changes can provide evidence of diffuse fibrosis in the myocardium that can signal heart disease. Quantitative maps also are reproducible, directly comparable longitudinally and across subjects, and less affected by the properties of the scanner used, when compared versus common weighted (non-quantitative) clinical imaging. But, quantitative imaging involves more complicated and time-consuming pulse sequences. To accomplish this goal, this project will develop new machine learning algorithms for high-quality parameter mapping from free-breathing data. The first aim of this project will increase parameter map resolution achievable from highly accelerated, noisy data. The proposed method will integrate existing deep cascade network-based image reconstructions with convolutional network-based blocks for super-resolution and parameter map estimation. Preliminary studies suggest these new blocks improve sharpness and mitigate artifacts in the reconstructed parameter maps. The next aim will improve the training precision of such artificial neural networks to account for the significant per-voxel nonlinear fit variability in quantitative MRI. The proposed method will reweight the loss function used for calibrating these networks by the goodness-of-fit (coefficient of determination) of the reference maps obtained from fully sampled training data. Preliminary results demonstrate that quality-aware reweighting significantly improves reconstructed image quality when working with noisy training data. Experiments will evaluate the precision of both of these innovations against existing deep-learning-based reconstructions on T1 maps obtained from pre- and post-contrast cardiac images of volunteer patients. The final aim will address motion during the acquisition by estimating and tracking nonrigid motion in the data consistency stages of the deep cascade artificial neural network architecture. Two methods are proposed: deformable motion estimation already demonstrated on compressive model-based image reconstructions, and a new “re-blurring” convolutional neural network that automatically introduces artifacts into a “clean” image to match the motion-corrupted data. Both of these methods enforce consistency between motion-affected data and a motion-free image during the reconstruction. Both methods will be validated on both cardiac and abdominal images for motion artifacts and reconstruction quality against breath-held parameter mapping acquisitions. Project Narrative Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging noninvasively measures physical properties of tissue connected to cardiovascular disease and many other conditions. Novel machine learning methods for processing data to produce higher quality maps will facilitate earlier and more accurate treatment of these diseases. This project will facilitate rapid quantitative imaging with freely breathing subjects.",Generalizing Deep Learning Reconstruction for Free-Breathing and Quantitative MRI,10007241,R56EB028254,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Balance training', 'Brain', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Fibrosis', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardium', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Weight', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'coronary fibrosis', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'loss of function', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motion sensitivity', 'multitask', 'neural network architecture', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'physical property', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R56,2019,347527,0.00503389242818616
"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder. In this project, we propose to develop a fully automatic image post-processing pipeline and multidimensional big data analyses based on machine learning techniques, with the aim to uncover latent information from complex dataset and with the ultimate goal of setting up a platform for OA precision medicine",Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis,9742424,R00AR070902,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'California', 'Cartilage', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Gait', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Institutes', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'bone', 'career development', 'cartilage degradation', 'connectome', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging scientist', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'kinematics', 'member', 'modifiable risk', 'morphometry', 'multidimensional data', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'parallel processing', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'racial difference', 'repository', 'shape analysis', 'soft tissue', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R00,2019,249000,0.015750629755632156
"Low- and Zero-dose Contrast-enhanced MRI Using Deep Learning Project Summary Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are used in approximately a third of all MRI scans. The unique relaxation parameters of GBCAs create indispensable image contrast for a wide range of clinical applications, such as angiography and tumor detection. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF can be painful, cause severe disability, and even death. The risk of developing NSF prevents millions of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams. The recent identification of gadolinium deposition within the brain and body has raised additional safety concerns about the usage of GBCAs. Studies have demonstrated increased signal intensity on the unenhanced T1-weighted MR images that is correlated with previous GBCA exposure, and this gadolinium retention is independent of renal function. While initial reports focused on linear GBCAs, more recent reports show that gadolinium deposition occurs with macrocyclic GBCAs as well, albeit at lower levels. FDA has recently issued warnings about gadolinium retention following contrast-enhanced MRI, and required GBCA manufacturers to conduct human and animal studies to further assess the safety of these contrast agents. This project addresses these concerns by developing low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI using artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL). Approach: This fast-track project has two phases and three aims. Aim 1 (Phase I) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using pre-contrast images and contrast-enhanced images acquired with only 10% of standard GBCA dose. A software infrastructure will be constructed to seamlessly integrate the DL software between MR scanners and PACS. Aim 2 (Phase II) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using GBCA-free acquisitions with different image contrast. In Aim 3 (Phase II), we will clinically validate and evaluate both low-dose and zero-dose DL methods, including on patients with mild- to-moderate CKD. Non-inferiority tests and diagnostic performance of the synthesized full-dose images compared to the true full-dose images will be performed. Significance: This work will lead to safer contrast-enhanced MRI. The low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI method will benefit not only millions of patients with advanced CKD, who cannot currently undergo contrast-enhanced MRI, but many more patients with normal kidney function, who are at the risk of gadolinium retention after contrast-enhanced MRI. Project Narrative Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in MRI exams to create indispensable image contrast for monitoring treatment and investigating pathology and function. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, preventing patients with advanced chronic kidney disease from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams, as well as potential gadolinium deposition in the body and brain for patients with normal kidney function. This project aims to address these problems by developing and validating low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI using deep learning. !",Low- and Zero-dose Contrast-enhanced MRI Using Deep Learning,9776655,R44EB027560,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Infrastructure', 'Kidney Failure', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis\xa0', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Relaxation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Validation', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'learning strategy', 'prevent', 'software development', 'tumor']",NIBIB,"SUBTLE MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2019,185379,0.053067889484914095
"Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy Project Summary/Abstract Diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy (LR) currently relies on a qualitative interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and lacks standardization. This has led to inconsistent treatment and rising costs, while quality of life metrics have remained stagnant. To standardize the diagnosis of LR, the subjective and qualitative radiologic assessment needs to be augmented with accurate measurements of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas, two anatomical structures that are critical to the etiology of LR. However, precise measurements will require manual delineations of these regions on MRI. This is a tedious and time-consuming process that is not feasible on a daily, large-scale basis in the clinic. Deep Learning (DL) is a relatively new machine learning technique, which holds the promise of automating NF and CC segmentation. None the less, there remain several challenges to making DL-based segmentation routine in clinical practice. First, training and validating a DL model for segmentation of a given anatomical structure requires a large amount of expert annotated training data. Expert annotated data is expensive and time consuming to obtain, thus thwarting the development of quantitative imaging diagnostics for LR. To address this, we propose an expert-led manual delineation of NF and CC using de-identified MRI data extracted from UCLA's picture archiving and communications system (PACS). We expect the resulting database to contain data from over 35,000 lumbar MRI scans, with associated clinical history, demographics, and patient outcomes data. In a subset (1000) of these data, NFs and CCs will be annotated by multiple human expert raters. The consensus of these delineations will be used as ground truth segmentations to train, validate and improve our understanding of DL models. Secondly, as a part of this proposal, we aim to address several technical challenges that limit the deployment of automated image segmentation techniques to the clinic. Chief amongst these challenges is the failure of automated methodologies in the face of variation due to factors such as pathology, scanner protocol alterations, and general demographic variation. Additionally, our current understanding of DL does not allow us to categorically state the total number of expert annotated data that will be needed to train a model with a specified level of accuracy. Finally, we do not currently understand how selection of training cases for expert delineation affects generalization accuracy. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose experiments to define the relationship between DL algorithms and the cardinality of training data. We will also explore the use of unsupervised machine learning strategies, namely clustering and reinforcement learning, to understand how training data selection influences algorithmic accuracy. In summary, we propose to address data availability and technical knowledge gaps to the development of accurate DL-based techniques for automated NF and CC delineation, with a broader view to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of LR. Project Narrative Basing radiological diagnoses on a quantitative characterization of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas would greatly improve the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar radiculopathy (LR). Manual measurement of this anatomy on every clinical study is not feasible; however, deep learning- (DL) based automated methods can reliable perform this task if 1) expert annotations to train DL algorithms are available and 2) we can train DL models to work accurately despite image heterogeneity. We address these knowledge gaps by developing 1) a database containing spine MR images with expert annotation of NFs and CCs and 2) intelligent training data selection frameworks to train DL algorithms and assess their robustness to heterogeneity.",Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy,9746373,R21EB026665,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Central cord canal structure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural History', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiculopathy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Diseases', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'theories', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment optimization', 'unsupervised learning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,234000,0.005218344497811177
"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",9766063,R01EB028146,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Fibrosis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Iron', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'body system', 'deep learning', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'magnetic field', 'magnetohydrodynamic', 'mathematical model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'time use', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,676760,0.04014228929166072
"Artificial intelligence-enabled, real-time communication software for optimizing clinical decision making during the allocation, procurement, and transplantation of donated organs Project Abstract for HealthTech Solutions Kidney transplantation is a clinically effective and cost-effective treatment for patients suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and diabetes. Twenty-two patients die each day waiting for a transplant and 30% of all deaths in the US could be prevented by organ transplant. Despite the obvious clinical and cost-effective advantages of kidney transplantation, there has been a decades-long rise in the kidney discard rate from 5.1% in 1988 to 19.2% in 2015. During a successful Phase I grant and to address the need for a dedicated communications system to help improve transplant patient outcomes and achieve greater donated organ utilization, HealthTech Solutions (HTS), Inc. developed a proprietary mobile application for secure team communication tailored specifically for kidney transplant teams. To further improve communication efficiency and augment critical decision making in healthcare, specifically for surgeons, HTS will employ machine learning (ML) powered clinical decision support. Clinical decision support (CDS) may significantly increase access, increase quality, and reduce the cost of kidney transplantation. The proposed project is designed to further test and quantify the improvement of the donor management, coordination process, and kidney utilization outcomes using the company’s CDS and communication infrastructure for medical team communication. The aims are; 1) Develop CDS models specifically for transplant professionals aimed at improving decision times and decision confidence. Develop the CDS infrastructure capable of handling medical data and serving insights safely, securely, and rapidly; 2) Asses usability by working with a test group to exceed usability criteria and ensure that CDS meets clinician needs through user feedback iterations. Verification of utility from a diversified testing group (n=10) that represent every type of professional involved in transplant cases. 3) Measure the effects of TXP Chat enhanced with CDS after live clinical implementation in the kidney offer and procurement processes for more than 3,000 offers (1,500 with CDS and 1,500 control) over a period of 365 days with multiple partner institutions (n=3). TXP Chat and CDS will demonstrate to be reliable, secure, trustworthy and useful by the clinical/technical community, increase kidney acceptance practices resulting in an increase in kidney transplants, reduction in cold ischemic time, and reduction in time from offer to transplant. Ultimately, these metrics have been demonstrated in the literature to improve patient outcomes, reduce expensive chronic treatment costs (e.g. dialysis), reduce patient deaths from lack of kidney availability, and significantly improve human health and productivity. Study results will be disseminated via publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Aim 1 will lay the foundation for further development to enable wider CDS in the Phase IIB. Aim 2 will prove physician support and steady adoption trend as we roll into commercialization. Aim 3 will provide multi-center pilot study data used to prove increased efficiency of the process in terms of time, money, and total number of kidneys transplanted. Project Narrative Despite the obvious clinical and cost-effectiveness advantages of kidney transplantation for many patients, nearly 1 in 5 kidneys authorized for donation are discarded. This project addresses the need for an efficient communications software technology enhanced with clinical decision support tailored for organ procurement organizations and transplant centers. Combined with enhanced communication efficiency, clinical decision support powered by machine learning may significantly improve donated kidney utilization and increase the number of viable, but currently unused organs that could otherwise be successfully transplanted, reducing waste and saving lives.","Artificial intelligence-enabled, real-time communication software for optimizing clinical decision making during the allocation, procurement, and transplantation of donated organs",9845904,R44LM012575,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asses', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Direct Costs', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Journals', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Multiple Partners', 'Organ', 'Organ Procurements', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Renal Glycosuria', 'Reporting', 'Savings', 'Secure', 'Surgeon', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Transplanted tissue', 'Treatment Cost', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'burnout', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical implementation', 'cohesion', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'mobile application', 'operation', 'prevent', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'transmission process', 'transplant centers', 'trend', 'usability', 'wasting']",NLM,ORGANIZER,R44,2019,512863,0.035446974322519545
"2019 STONE LAB SCIENTIFIC SYMPOSIUM: THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR KIDNEY STONE DISEASE 2019 STONE LAB SCIENTIFIC SYMPOSIUM: THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR KIDNEY STONE DISEASE  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A 1.5-day symposium, StoneLab will be held December 6-7, 2019 at AUA Headquarters in Linthicum, Maryland, near BWI Airport. The novel StoneLab Symposium will be a meeting where kidney stone researchers can come together with experts in biomedical engineering, physics, chemistry, artificial intelligence, medical device design and development. We plan to encourage researchers to “think outside the box” in the search for advances in kidney stone treatment. The target audience for this meeting includes: urologists, nephrologists, basic scientists, early-career investigators, residents, research fellows, and project management members of urology research teams in the area of nephrolithiasis and related technology development. It is essential that the urology community, and especially trainees, early-career physician- scientists, and researchers be provided with accessible opportunities to gain understanding of new knowledge and recent advances in not only their own fields, but in related fields that they may not otherwise be aware of, and leverage this for new research frameworks that can help improve the treatment of kidney stone disease. A critical aspect of the StoneLab Sympoisum is the delivery of talks from outside the normal realm of kidney stone research by leading basic scientists, followed by discussions led by kidney stone researchers and surgeons. The intent of these discussions is to spur the development of collaborations and the generation of new ideas and avenues for exploration. Another goal of the meeting is to help identify future funding needs and growth areas for kidney stone research. The R13 support requested in this application will encourage early investigators to participate in the workshop and stimulate their development as researchers and surgeon- scientists. This symposium will have a major impact by bringing together premier kidney stone researchers, along with experts in nephrology, biomedical engineering, physics, chemistry, artificial intelligence, and medical device design and development, to explore solutions for the most pressing translational science issues facing kidney stone researchers today. The Principal Investigator (PI), Carolyn J.M. Best, PhD, is AUA Director of Research. The Program Planning Committee consists of a diverse multidisciplinary team of distinguished scientists and urologists, most of whom also serve in leadership roles of several AUA-affiliated subspecialty societies: Khurshid Ghani, MD, MS (Chair); Ben H. Chew, MD, MSc (Co-Chair); Thomas Chi, MD; Benjamin Canales, MD, MPH; Gary Curhan, MD, ScD; Amy Krambeck, MD; Dirk Lange, PhD; Manoj Monga, MD, FACS; Kristina Penniston, PhD,RD; and Aria Olumi, MD (ex-officio). 2019 STONE LAB SCIENTIFIC SYMPOSIUM: THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR KIDNEY STONE DISEASE  PROJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT This application seeks support to enable the American Urological Association (AUA) to invite early-career investigators (and late-stage trainees) to participate in a novel interdisciplinary symposium where premier kidney stone researchers, along with experts in nephrology, can come together with experts in biomedical engineering, physics, chemistry, artificial intelligence, and medical device design and development with the aim of “thinking outside the box” in the search for advances in kidney stone treatment.

"Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by  Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging can provide safe, non-invasive, and whole-brain measurements for large clinical and research studies of brain disorders. However, many disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alterations, which are often difficult to tease out due to limited image quality afforded by the popular 3T MRI scanners (with 20,000+ units available worldwide). Although 7T MRI scanners provide better image quality, these ultrahigh field scanners are not widely available (with only 40+ units available worldwide) and are also not used clinically. Thus, tools for reconstructing 7T-like high-quality MRI from 3T MRI scan are highly desirable. A means for achieving this is by learning the relationship between 3T and 7T MRI scans from training samples. This renewal project is dedicated to developing a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels of 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD. Specifically, (Aim 1) to enhance the image quality of 3T MRI, we will develop a novel deep learning architecture to learn a complex multi-layer 3T-to-7T mapping from training subjects, each with coupled 3T and 7T MRI scans. This mapping will then be applied to reconstruct quality-enhanced 7T-like MRI scans from new 3T MRI scans. (Aim 2) For brain structural measurement (e.g., brain atrophies, and hippocampal volume shrinkage), a crucial step is brain tissue segmentation. We will thus develop a robust and accurate random forest tissue segmentation method, which maps 7T label information to 3T scans. The mapping function is trained using tissue labels generated for 7T scans, instead of 3T scans which often have limited image contrast. (Aim 3) To further quantify local atrophies in ROIs or even sub-ROIs (i.e., hippocampal subfields), we will develop a deformable multi-ROI segmentation method by employing (a) random forest to predict deformation from each image location to the target boundary by adaptive integration of multimodal (anatomical, structural & functional connectivity) information and (b) auto-context model to iteratively refine ROI segmentation results. Note that the adaptive integration of multimodal MRI data, especially resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), is critical to the segmentation of sub-ROIs such as hippocampal subfields, since local functional connectivity patterns can help distinguish boundaries between neighboring subfields that often have different cortico-cortical connections. (Aim 4) Finally, by integrating anatomical features from all accurately segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs and also structural & functional connectivity features between those segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs, we can more effectively detect early-stage brain disorders, i.e., the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. We will integrate information from different imaging datasets and multiple imaging centers by using our novel multi-task learning approach for jointly learning the respective disease prediction models. Applications. These computational methods will find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormalities associated with various neurological diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia), measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between imaging and clinical scores. Narrative Description of Project The goal of this renewal project is to achieve robust brain measurements from the routine 3T MRI, guided by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI. To this end, we will create a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels from 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new testing subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD.",Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI,9698938,R01EB006733,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multi-task learning', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'research study', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,446909,0.012476358923992702
"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9695208,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'kidney dysfunction', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'predictive test', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'random forest', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,335803,0.045280414968393426
"Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement ABSTRACT This proposal aims to develop deep learning methods to automate the extraction of morphological imaging features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA), and total knee replacement. While, quantitative evaluation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in OA research in the clinical setting MR reports often tend to be subjective, qualitative, and the grading schemes utilized in epidemiological research are not used because they are extraordinarily time consuming and do not lend themselves to the demands of todays changing healthcare scenario. The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.!",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,9669002,R61AR073552,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cartilage', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Subchondral Cyst', 'Supervision', 'Synovitis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disease classification', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'joint destruction', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R61,2019,447173,0.011484867821556341
"A new approach to predict graft outcome from histology in children undergoing kidney transplantation using machine learning methods Abstract Although the overall renal graft survival has dramatically improved over the last several decades, almost half of pediatric patients lose their transplant within 10 years. Epidemiology, immunology and histology are all key elements in understanding post-transplant complications and in predicting clinical outcomes, however accurate prediction of transplant outcomes remains challenging and understudied among pediatric kidney transplant recipients. Machine learning technology is rapidly advancing and has demonstrated remarkable predictive accuracy surpassing classical predictive models in several biomedical applications. The goal of this research proposal is to develop machine learning methods to improve prediction of transplant outcomes through analysis of histology, assemble data sufficient to describe the incidence of different types of rejection and histological findings on pediatric kidney transplant biopsies, and to assess their impact on graft outcome. To achieve these goals, we will assemble an international multicenter cohort of over 700 pediatric kidney transplant recipients and develop and validate machine-learning models combining clinical, immunological and histological data for predicting short-term pediatric graft outcomes. This study will enable accurate, reproducible, and standardized assessment of histopathological findings in pediatric transplant recipients and provide a new method to predict graft outcome. This will pave the way to future large, prospective study assessing the feasibility and potential impact of machine-learning methods in transplant biopsy analysis, with the goal of improving clinical management and resource utilization by identifying patients with high risk of graft loss. Finally, this study will provide critical information for efficient and effective design of clinical trials focused on improving outcomes of pediatric kidney transplant recipients, with an emphasis on individualized treatment. Project Narrative: Accurate prediction of graft outcome in pediatric kidney transplant patients is critical to individualize patients' management and treatment and to design efficient and effective clinical trials focused on improving outcomes of these patients. Our long-term goal is to improve the assessment of histopathological findings in pediatric transplant recipients and create a new systematic methodology to predict graft outcomes that can be applied nationally and internationally.

"Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI Project Summary/Abstract Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides arguably the most comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular system; however, respiratory motion continues to adversely impact CMR, causing artifacts that lead to poor image quality, repeated scans, and decreased throughput, and thus represents a significant obstacle to clinical utility. For single-shot CMR, cardiac and breathing motions are “frozen” by limiting the acquisition to an end-diastolic window less than 200 ms. For first pass perfusion, breathing motion cannot be eliminated because data from 50 to 60 consecutive heartbeats are required to capture contrast dynamics. For other single-shot applications such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and parameter mapping, respiratory motion is introduced when the acquisition is repeated across several heartbeats to improve spatial and temporal resolution. To eliminate respiratory motion from single-shot images, non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) has been promoted as an attractive option that provides 100% acquisition efficiently. MOCO can be used either after the reconstruction or during the reconstruction. Such techniques, however, cannot account for through-plane motion, which can only be corrected prospectively, and can fail depending on image quality and the extent of motion. Prospective compensation of the respiratory motion has been recognized as an attractive alternative to existing gating and MOCO methods. Proposed methods use one or more navigator echoes—incompatible with or inefficient for many CMR protocols—to capture the respiratory motion and rely on simple parametric models that are inadequate to describe complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion. Due to these limitations, prospective methods have found limited applicability even in research settings. We propose a new framework to prospectively compensate respiratory motion. The proposed method, called PROspective Motion compensation using Pilot Tone (PROMPT), employs Pilot Tone technology and leverages machine learning principles to first learn complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion on a patient-specific basis and then prospectively compensate the motion by tracking the imaging plane, in real time, as a function of a Pilot Tone based respiratory signal. If successful, this synergistic combination of Pilot Tone and machine learning will lead to 100% efficiency for single-shot CMR exams performed under free-breathing conditions, will eliminate the need to setup navigator echoes, respiratory bellows, or other inefficient prospective gating measures, will minimize through-plane motion that can render the images non-diagnostic for CMR applications including fast-pass perfusion, parameter mapping, LGE, and coronary angiography, will provide a reliable surrogate measure of respiratory motion, and will facilitate highly accelerated compressive recovery. Project Narrative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many potential advantages over currently used imaging methods to diagnose heart disease, but MRI images can be ruined if the patient breathes during the scan. In this project, we will develop a method that is insensitive to breathing motion and compare it to existing methods. These efforts should lead to significant improvements in diagnosis of heart disease so that patients may benefit from appropriate treatment.",Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI,9762101,R21EB026657,"['Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Gadolinium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'healthy volunteer', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,223680,0.04102224863166399
"Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival  Chronic kidney disease affects about 10% of adults in the United States and 7-12% of the population worldwide. It may lead to irreversible loss of kidney function, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For patients with ESRD, kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment compared to dialysis in terms of patient survival, quality of life and cost. Despite the advantages of kidney transplants, most patients with ESRD are treated with dialysis primarily because there exist an insufficient number of compatible donors for patients. The human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) of the organ donor and recipient are known to be a significant contributing factor to transplanted organ survival times due to immunogenicity, the immune response of the recipient to the transplanted organ. Mismatches between donor and recipient HLAs are associated with shorter survival times; however, it is extremely rare to identify donors that have a perfect match with recipients, so most transplants involve mismatched HLAs. Our main objective is to accurately predict survival times for kidney transplants by incorporating both data- driven models of HLA compatibility based on outcomes of past transplants and biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity. Accurate prediction of survival times can improve patient transplant outcomes by enabling more efficient allocation of donors and recipients, particularly by reducing the number of repeat transplants due to graft failure with a poorly matched donor. We propose to estimate HLA compatibilities using high-dimensional variable selection techniques applied to outcomes of past transplants and through a novel donor-recipient latent space model for the HLA compatibility network. We then propose to incorporate these predicted compatibilities along with biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity using amino acid sequences and epitopes into a multi-task classification-based survival prediction algorithm. Our proposed approach for learning integrated data- and biologically-driven models of transplant survival generalizes broadly to organ transplantation (liver, heart, pancreas, lungs) and possibly to bone marrow transplantation. Finding better methods for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient may redefine and improve clinical outcomes for organ and tissue transplants. In fact, new approach may revolutionize the selection of donors with recipients, thereby producing significantly improved long-term organ and tissue transplant survivals.",Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival ,9916110,R01LM013311,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens', 'Anus', 'Biological', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Donor Selection', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epitopes', 'HLA Antigens', 'Heart', 'Immune response', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ Donor', 'Organ Survival', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Science', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Transplanted tissue', 'United States', 'base', 'cost', 'discrete time', 'graft failure', 'hazard', 'high dimensionality', 'human model', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'learning network', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'survival prediction', 'transplant model']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO,R01,2019,274577,0.03789384031985989
"In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging ABSTRACT Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology, a primary protein abnormality in the rare diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is now recognized as a common age-related neuropathology, detected at autopsy in approximately 50% of older persons. According to recent evidence, TDP43 pathology in aging is associated with more rapid cognitive decline and higher odds of dementia, above and beyond contributions from Alzheimer’s and other age-related neuropathologies. In spite of its high frequency and deleterious effects, TDP43 can only be diagnosed at autopsy, and there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging by combining multimodal MRI and pathology in the same older persons from large community cohorts. Specifically, we propose to a) train TDP43 classifiers using machine learning based on ex- vivo MRI measurements of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical brain characteristics of older persons, b) translate these classifiers in-vivo, and c) test them in-vivo using longitudinal clinical, in-vivo MRI, and pathology data on older adults enrolled without dementia. We have generated a unique ex-vivo and in-vivo multimodal MRI-pathology database within the infrastructure of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG17917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), two longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical- pathologic cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates and high autopsy rates. Using our database, we have produced compelling preliminary results in support of our aims. First, we have demonstrated that ex-vivo brain MRI data can be linked to in-vivo MRI data. Second, we show that TDP43 pathology is related to specific brain MRI characteristics independent of other age-related pathologies. Third, we show high TDP43 classification performance (AUC=0.81) based on ex-vivo MRI features in persons with as well as without comorbid Alzheimer’s pathology (a common coexisting pathology). Fourth, we demonstrate that the confidence score obtained from ex-vivo MRI classification is linked to the progression of deposition of TDP43 pathology (i.e. TDP43 stages). Finally, we translated a preliminary ex-vivo TDP43 classifier for use in-vivo and demonstrated in a small sample that it has high in-vivo classification performance, and is independently associated with lower cognition. We propose to further develop and test this promising in-vivo MRI classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology is now recognized as a common and deleterious age-related neuropathology, however, there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging, and diagnosis is only possible at autopsy. The objective of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in older community- dwelling persons with and without dementia, based on a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical characteristics of the brain. Successful completion of the proposed work will have broad immediate implications in refining participant selection in clinical trials, as well as long term implications in the advancement of translational research and targeted disease-specific therapeutic approaches.",In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging,9802664,R01AG064233,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Autopsy', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Religion and Spirituality', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'base', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'in vivo', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'recruit', 'response']",NIA,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,708822,-0.013969734722659789
"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9688580,R01HL133616,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational algorithm', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Institution', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Language', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Reader', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Visceral fat', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated analysis', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'coronary artery calcium', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary vasculature', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'routine imaging', 'sudden cardiac death']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,653101,0.030090246889999263
"In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones OVERALL SUMMARY  The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and inefficient emergency department visits that typically include repetitive exposure to ionizing radiation from diagnostic imaging, and will significantly reduce the often lengthy (days to weeks) wait time patients must endure before procedures for stone removal can be scheduled and performed. As the proposed therapy system is entirely noninvasive, patients will be treated on an outpatient basis. Further, as the system is designed to efficiently and painlessly break stones of any size and expel the fragments from the kidney, the treatment of both symptomatic and asymptomatic stones using this technology will reduce the high retreatment and stone event recurrence rates associated with current surgical interventions for stone removal.  In this effort, we will combine stone breakage by burst wave lithotripsy (BWL), clearance of fragments by ultrasonic propulsion (UP), and stone-specific ultrasound imaging (S-mode) into an integrated system in which exposure strategies are adapted during treatment in response to real-time acoustic feedback to enhance comminution efficiency and patient safety. We will tailor treatment by investigating numerically and in lab tests the primary mechanisms - cavitation and elastic waves - involved in the comminution process over a broad parameter space. We will develop acoustics-based feedback including model- based, machine learning and passive acoustic mapping (PAM) of the bubble field to signal the need to adjust the energy output. We will investigate the morphological and functional response of the kidney in living animals and in ex vivo perfused porcine kidneys, and pursue tissue protective treatment strategies such as power ramping.  These studies will include the first in-human test of BWL in which we will compare the comminution effectiveness and safety of treatment with and without adaptive output control in response to acoustic feedback. In addition, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of the benefits and risks of fragmenting and expelling symptomatic and asymptomatic stones in the clinic. Toward application of the system for use in humans, we will refine and validate the use of UP and S-mode together to improve stone and fragment detection. With our eye on the future of stone management, we will develop and validate in vivo an extracorporeal acoustic tractor beam to grasp and carry fragments through the complex three- dimensional path of the urinary space and out of the kidney. OVERALL NARRATIVE Urinary stone disease, which affects 1 in 11 Americans, is one of the most painful diseases and also the costliest non-malignant urologic disease, because current management is limited to observation for the stone to pass or performing surgery. The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based, handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and temporizing emergency department visits and radiation exposing imaging while the patient waits in pain for days to weeks for the stone to pass or be surgically removed.","In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones",9791705,P01DK043881,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Bowman&apos', 's space', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lithotripsy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Non-Malignant', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Painless', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Publications', 'Radiation exposure', 'Ramp', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Tissue', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retreatment', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Wait Time', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'calcification', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'grasp', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individualized medicine', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'response', 'safety study', 'simulation', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P01,2019,1619137,0.009092131511796055
"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism,9786824,K23NS105944,"['Affect', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical assessments', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Red nucleus structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Subjects Selections', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromelanin', 'neuron loss', 'nigrostriatal system', 'novel', 'pars compacta', 'patient screening', 'putamen', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,192564,0.026297427307144555
"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantification is crucial for clinical management of these children.

"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease,9663985,R01HL115828,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Common Ventricle', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Sex Differences', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'adverse outcome', 'analysis pipeline', 'aortic valve', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical translation', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data archive', 'data pipeline', 'data sharing', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'shear stress', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue degeneration', 'tool', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,740572,0.07508820479849071
"Automatic quantification of myocardial motion in older adults Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is a common condition that represents the end stage of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) subsequent to progressing myocardial damage or ischemia. In populations at ages 65 and older, coronary artery disease (CAD) serves as the leading cause of HF. Although low left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) is a major evidence for the diagnosis of HF in clinical practice, impaired regional myocardial dysfunction is expected to present the existence of CAD in its early stage.  Heart deformation analysis (HDA) is a cutting-edge myocardial motion analysis technique that is able to automatically track the myocardium borders on time frames and calculate global and regional cardiac functional and motional indices on existing cine images without extra scans. In the present study, we will use the HDA tool to analyze existing cine images of CHARISMA study. From 2009 to 2012, cardiac MRI exams (including coronary wall imaging and cine MRI at two-chamber, four-chamber and short-axis views) and concurrent tests for traditional cardiovascular risk factors were performed on 440 older participants (age: 65 - 84 years old at the time of MRI scans) without documented history of CVDs. During the present R03 project (2019-2021), CHARISMA participants would have been followed-up for 10 - 12 years. We plan to relate newly- acquired regional myocardial motion indices (displacement, velocity, strain and strain rate) to clinical outcomes, existing coronary wall measures and results of lab tests in CHARISMA datasets. We will test the overall hypothesis that regional myocardial motion indices have the potential to present cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic elderly. Three specific aims are: 1) Predict cardiovascular events using baseline regional myocardial motion indices; 2) Relate regional myocardial motion indices to MRI-derived features of coronary remodeling; and 3) Determine correlations between regional myocardial motion indices and traditional cardiovascular risk biomarkers/conditions collected in CHARISMA study.  No new MRI scans or lab tests are required in this project. Through a cost-effective approach, the immediate objective of the proposed project is to evaluate the clinical value of regional myocardial motion for cardiovascular risk stratification in asymptomatic older adults, a major target population of cardiovascular prevention. This study will also help us better understand the correlations between impaired myocardial function/motion and subclinical CAD burden. Furthermore, the results will facilitate the selection of quantitative imaging biomarkers and their optimal cut-off points for predicting cardiovascular events in future clinical studies. Project Narrative  In the present study, we will use heart deformation analysis (HDA) to reanalyze existing cardiac MRI data of CHARISMA study.

"CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI Renewal CARDIA Y35 Brain MRI Renewal Ancillary Study Abstract Many studies have established strong relationships between cerebrovascular disease (CEVD), morphological and physiological brain changes, including stroke, and cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer disease and related disorders (ADRD). New physiological and functional MRI (fMRI) methods allow non- invasive measurement of regional cerebral blood flow, vascular reactivity and physiological brain connectivity. These techniques provide the means to evaluate the morphology, pathophysiology, and brain dysfunction related to CEVD and ADRD. The CARDIA Year 25 and Year 30 Brain MRI Substudies were designed to incorporate state-of-the-art MRI technology into the relatively younger population of CARDIA in order to determine MRI correlates of CVD risk factors and detect early CEVD. These studies documented early MRI changes of CEVD with strong correlations to CVD risk factors, particularly hypertension. The CARDIA Year 35 MRI Ancillary Study is intended to extend these earlier studies into the late middle age population of CARDIA. Most biomarkers of CEVD and ADRD are weakly expressed until approximately age 55, when they begin their precipitous rise to the steep slope evident in the 6th and 7th decades of life. Correspondingly, subclinical disease becomes clinically evident, reflected by increasing physiological changes and cognitive deficits. However, confounding the effects of CEVD are age, lifestyle, and co-morbidities, including ADRD. CARDIA, with its lengthy and rich historical data, is well-positioned to dissect the intricacies of CEVD and putative relationship to ADRD in the transition from middle age to seniority, starting at ages with few comorbidities and low medication use. Approximately 1044 participants will be enrolled in the Ancillary Study from the four participating Field Centers. MRI participants will be recruited from previous CARDIA Brain MRI participants and receive brain MRI scans and cognitive testing as defined for Y25 and Y30. Computer analysis of MRI data will be reported quantitatively by anatomic regions-of-interest. The primary objectives are to: 1) enhance statistical power to better document previously described and newly defined associations between demographic measures, risk factors and brain MRI findings, 2) define MRI parameters most strongly associated with clinical events and cognitive changes, and 3) identify early MRI biomarker patterns that inform disease pathophysiology and progression at an individual level. CARDIA Y35 Brain MRI Renewal Ancillary Study Project Narrative The CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI ancillary proposal will study the long-term associations between cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease risk factors, brain MRI findings, clinical events, and cognitive changes in young and mid adulthood as reflected in the CARDIA population. Early-onset and mid-life clinical events and cognitive changes in conjunction with a third brain MRI study and cognitive testing will allow us to define MRI pattern subtypes better reflecting pathophysiological variants reflective of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. The primary objectives are to: 1) enhance statistical power to better document previously described and newly defined associations between demographic measures, risk factors and brain MRI findings. 2) define MRI parameters most strongly associated with clinical events and cognitive changes reflective of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, and 3) identify new, early MRI biomarker patterns that inform disease pathophysiology and progression at an individual level.",CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI Renewal,9891574,R01AG062819,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Ancillary Study', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Analysis', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'aging population', 'blood pressure regulation', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain volume', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'early onset', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'men', 'middle age', 'neuroimaging', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'sex', 'study population', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,1803300,0.01904460094902963
"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules. In this proposal we will perform high-content, high throughput screening for kidney regeneration in zebrafish to discover novel chemical probes to investigate mechanisms of augmented kidney regeneration after injury.",High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs,9613245,R01DK112652,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fibrosis', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Microsomes', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Organogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Prodrugs', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Renal tubule structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'kidney repair', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'organ growth', 'organ regeneration', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,352125,0.005344363543557365
"Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in ~20% of cardiac surgical patients. Several cohort and registry studies have reported that AKI defined by rise in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery associates with development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events. However, it is unclear which patients will develop long-term adverse kidney events, adverse cardiovascular events, or both. In recent years blood and urine AKI biomarkers have been identified that reflect different aspects of AKI biology and that detect serum creatinine defined AKI earlier than rise in serum creatinine or detect subclinical AKI that is not revealed by traditional serum creatinine assessment. Clinical outcomes and biomarker research has focused mainly on detecting cardiac surgery- associated AKI itself, but not on predicting which patients are at greatest risk for long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after AKI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that perioperative blood and urine AKI biomarkers significantly associate with increased long-term (2 to 5 years) postoperative major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MAKE is defined as the composite of dialysis, death, renal hospitalization, or ≥ 30 day postoperative eGFR decline >25% from preoperative baseline. MACE is defined as the composite of death or hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, arrhythmia, or stroke. We propose a prospective observational cohort study of 610 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years following cardiac surgery. Based on preliminary data we will assess plasma NT-pro- B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma intact fibroblast growth factor 23, serum cystatin C, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 AKI biomarkers preoperatively and at 5 postoperative time points. This proposal will address three specific aims: 1) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MAKE during long-term follow-up; 2) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MACE during long-term follow-up; and 3) To develop clinical prediction models for long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional regression modeling, we will use machine learning that leverages detailed perioperative data including time-varying intraoperative and intensive care unit clinical data and blood and urine AKI biomarker data to create high performing prediction models. Our proposal is significant because knowing what blood and urine AKI biomarkers and clinical parameters accurately predict long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after cardiac surgery provides the foundation for clinical trials that will identify effective short and long-term interventions for patients at highest risk. Our proposal is innovative because clinical and biomarker data has not been leveraged in this way to predict long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because combining blood and urine acute kidney injury biomarkers and clinical data to identify cardiac surgical patients at highest risk for long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes will allow interventional studies to better individualize clinical management to prevent these outcomes. While acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is associated with increased long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (~25% incidence), it remains unclear which patients with postoperative acute kidney injury are at highest risk. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that can be applied to enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability.",Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery,9800334,R01HL148448,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Anesthesiology', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Applications Grants', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain natriuretic peptide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Science', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Foxes', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nephrology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasma', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Transfusion', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'health record', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'post gamma-globulins', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rat KIM-1 protein']",NHLBI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,802772,0.03177288592440823
"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,9669022,R01EB016695,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,569563,0.012242823039784249
"Quantitative Renal Imaging for Kidney Diseases Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography (CEMRA) with gadolinium (Gd) provides high resolution visualization of the vascular compartment, but is rarely used in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73m2) due to the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). There is thus an unmet need to develop MRI techniques that can both replace Gd and provide new insights into the etiology and severity of CKD.  PI Sridhar and his team at Northeastern University (NEU) have developed a new technique, Quantitative Ultra-short Time-to-Echo Contrast-Enhanced (QUTE-CE) MRI, leads to quantifiable positive contrast images of the vasculature with unprecedented clarity and definition. QUTE-CE is particularly optimal using Ferumoxytol (Feraheme), an FDA approved iron-oxide nanopharmaceutical, that is already routinely used for iron-deficient anemia therapy in CKD patients. Under an ongoing clinical trial (NCT03266848) we have demonstrated QUTE- CE MRI for renal and cerebral imaging in humans at 3T.  This R21 project will develop the QUTE-CE MRI method for kidney imaging in patients with both normal kidney function as well as with CKD. We propose to scan 25 total patients (10 in Year 1 and 15 in Year 2) who are already scheduled to receive ferumoxytol infusion for iron-deficiency anemia therapy. The specific aims of this project are summarized below. Specific Aim 1: Renal Vascular Angiograms of CKD Patients. These studies will be conducted at NEU and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) using Siemens Prisma MRI scanners. Three tasks will be pursued to develop the optimizing protocol. Task 1: Develop a robust QUTE-CE imaging protocol. Task 2: Implement a robust methodology for accounting for B1 inhomogeneity. Task 3: Develop a robust trajectory for improved image reconstruction including motion correction. We hypothesize that QUTE-CE MRI will lead to high resolution angiograms that will allow for the safe diagnosis of existing pathologies such as renal artery stenosis in addition to the novel identification of kidney micro-vascular disease. Specific Aim 2: Obtain quantitative renal blood volume (RBV) maps and develop machine learning algorithms (MLA) to better understand the severity of kidney disease. The renal angiograms will be analyzed to obtain renal blood volume (RBV) maps. The RBV maps will be analyzed in terms of Machine-Learning algorithms (MLA) to explore whether we can identify common etiologies of CKD as well as estimate the severity of kidney disease. The MLA will enable organ segmentation, automatized renal parenchyma volumetry, as well as automated extraction and labeling of lesions. The MLA results will be compared with radiological scoring, estimated GFR, and degree of albuminuria. We hypothesize that the absolute RBV maps will enable quantitative monitoring of blood volume in cortex and medulla, and that RBV could be a surrogate parameter for renal microvascular rarefaction, a central mechanism in CKD initiation and progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE TITLE: Quantitative Renal Imaging for Kidney Disease This project will develop a quantitative magnetic resonance imaging technique QUTE-CE MRI for studies of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The QUTE-CE MRI methodology provides very clear and high resolution angiographic images of vasculature using a safe and clinically approved nanoparticle contrast agent, that will transform standard of care by enabling diagnostic imaging for a large population of patients with CKD who cannot be imaged with the current gadolinium contrast agent due to its toxicity.",Quantitative Renal Imaging for Kidney Diseases,9824779,R21DK118449,"['Accounting', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Cerebrum', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Cyst', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'FDA approved', 'Gadolinium', 'Gaussian model', 'General Hospitals', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infusion procedures', 'Iodine', 'Iron', 'Iron deficiency anemia', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic nanoparticles', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis\xa0', 'Nephrology', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Proteinuria', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Toxicity', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal Artery Stenosis', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Severities', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Veins', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'clinical imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'expectation', 'ferumoxytol', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'iron oxide', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney imaging', 'kidney vascular structure', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanodrug', 'nanoparticle', 'novel', 'nuclear imaging', 'patient population', 'prisma', 'prognostic', 'standard of care']",NIDDK,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,220889,0.08873624802613228
"Distinguishing Lipid Subtypes by Amplifying Contrast from J-Coupling Project Summary/Abstract With the global rise in obesity-related diseases and increasing recognition of the role of fat in diseases such as fatty liver, there is growing need for a noninvasive chemical assay of in vivo lipid depots. But the rich chemistry of these molecules is often ignored in MRI, which typically treats fat as a homogeneous proton species because differences in chemical shift and relaxation are difficult to distinguish in a clinical setting. Innovation: This proposal will be the first to use nonuniform echo spacing to generate J-coupling based contrast between chemically different fats. While fat spins often give monotonically decaying signal under a uniformly spaced spin echo train, J-coupling causes nonuniformly spaced spin echo trains to generate complex fingerprints, which distinguish and even quantify fats with otherwise similar MR properties. Significance: The immediate clinical impact will be to demonstrate a novel J-coupling based contrast mechanism in vivo which will contribute to a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish the 25% of the population with benign steatosis from the 2-3% with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The broader significance of this work is that this novel contrast mechanism could revolutionize the study and clinical management of many diseases associated with bioactive lipid subtypes. Approach: The aims are designed to test the hypothesis that nonuniform echo trains (1) can create contrast between different fats, which (2) will contribute to a multiparametric noninvasive protocol to distinguish benign steatosis and NASH. Aim 1 will identify the echo spacing best suited for distinguishing benign steatosis and NASH, first using density matrix simulations based on high resolution spectra of liver fat from animals with each disease, and then using experiments on whole rat livers. In Aim 2, the sequence developed in Aim 1 will be tested in humans with biopsy proven benign steatosis or NASH, along with a suite of standard methods of liver and fat characterization. This metric, and also metrics derived from conventional images, will be tested for the ability to separate these patient groups. In addition, machine learning algorithms will be used to find a metric that combines multiecho intensities with standard MR metrics. This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains as a new contrast mechanism and yield a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis and NASH. Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes. The results of this work will justify a larger scale study to properly validate the sensitivity to different fat species in humans. Project Narrative This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains both as a new J-coupling based contrast mechanism and as part of a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis (~25% of the population) from patients on the NASHfibrosiscirrhosis trajectory of metabolically induced liver disease (2- 3% of the population). Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes.

"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia. After considerable progress reducing the depth and duration of anes- thesia, this work aims to reduce the frequency of anesthesia through a synergistic combination of fast, quiet, motion-robust, automated, and adaptive scanning. This will make MRI safer, cheaper, and more widely available to children, reducing the population risk of radiation from CT.",Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI,9754130,R01EB009690,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body part', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Breathing', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'community setting', 'compliance behavior', 'contrast enhanced', 'design and construction', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'patient tolerability', 'pediatric patients', 'programs', 'radiation risk', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,683589,0.05025667689630807
"Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The inability of non-invasive techniques to quantify disease progression has limited understanding of the pathogenesis of OA. While numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been proposed for imaging OA, sensitivity to bone metabolism has been limited. We propose to develop advanced three-dimensional PET-MRI methods for bone and soft tissue metabolism to study the response of the tissues in the joint to changes in knee load. This work will lead to a new understanding of OA pathogenesis by revealing relationships between changes in cartilage and bone metabolism over time. This project aims to develop PET-MRI methods to sensitively track changes of OA in response to biomechanical loading. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop accurate, reproducible and dose-optimized kinetic models of dynamic 18F-NaF PET-MRI for quantitative bilateral whole joint imaging using deep learning and advanced MR coil technology, (2) Study the relationship between resting state bone metabolism and biomechanics using PET- MRI and (3) Perform a longitudinal study to assess the response of our new imaging methods to changes in joint biomechanics from gait retraining. The innovation of this work lies in the development of novel imaging techniques that simultaneously offer quantitative measures of tissue physiology in cartilage and bone using PET-MRI. The significance of this work is that we will be able to sensitively and quantitatively track changes in bone metabolism and soft tissue microstructure due to changes in biomechanical loading in the knee joint over time. This will provide new and more sensitive imaging tools to assess the responses of the joint to biomechanical interventions to treat OA such as gait retraining, bracing, or high tibial osteotomy. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for assessment of disease-modifying treatments such as bracing or gait modification. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using positron-emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health during mechanical treatment of osteoarthritis. !",Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis,9817807,R01AR074492,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Arthralgia', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Matrix', 'Bone Spur', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone remodeling', 'Cartilage', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Fluoride Ion', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Needs Assessment', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteotomy', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sclerosis', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone', 'bone metabolism', 'cartilage metabolism', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'gait examination', 'gait retraining', 'imaging approach', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'joint loading', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'mineralization', 'molecular marker', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'soft tissue', 'subchondral bone', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,561592,0.026892621392424307
"Development and Dissemination of Clinical CEST MRI Acquisition and Analysis Methods for Cancer Imaging Applications This research plan will continue our development of Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI acquisition and analysis methods for imaging patients with cancer. AcidoCEST MRI with an exogenous contrast agent is an innovative variation of this technique that measures extracellular pH in solid tumors. We have also developed an exceptionally innovative method that acquires endogenous CEST MR images with multiple powers, which can measure the chemical exchange rate of endogenous proteins that can assess relative differences in pH. We will improve our CEST MRI acquisition methods by accelerating the imaging speed, reducing and eliminating complications due to patient motion, eliminating complications caused by fat signal, and expanding to 3D imaging methods. We will also improve image analysis methods that are required for CEST contrast from endogenous proteins and exogenous contrast agents.  Our research has strong impact because acidoCEST MRI can track changes in tumor acidosis in response to chemotherapy and chemoradiation therapy in patients who have breast cancer and head & neck cancer. Endogenous CEST MRI can improve the diagnoses of brain tumor recurrence vs. pseudoprogression, and evaluations of lung cancer vs. lung infection. We will perform clinical studies with our endogenous and exogenous CEST MRI methods to image patients with brain, breast, lung, and head & neck cancers.  To amplify the impact of our research, we will develop versions of our CEST MRI acquisition methods for the many versions of the 13 Siemens hardware platforms and software operating systems at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. We will also develop user-friendly CEST analysis methods for many researchers at MD Anderson. We will leverage our unique research environment and expertise with intra-institutional dissemination to provide inter-institutional dissemination, by sharing share these acquisition and analysis tools with other CEST MRI researchers. We will collaborate with NIST to provide the first CEST MRI phantom that can standardize the development and implementation of intra- and inter-institutional CEST MRI methods.  Our team of outstanding investigators includes experts in CEST saturation methods, CEST MR image analysis, clinical contrast agents, rapid MRI acquisition methods, high field 7T MRI, clinical radiology, biostatistics, histopathology and oncology. Based on our expertise and years of productivity in clinical CEST MRI, we have developed an exceptional research approach. As the world's largest cancer center and a health destination, the MD Anderson Cancer Center has the patient population that provides very strong institutional support for our clinical studies. NARRATIVE We will develop new acquisition and analysis methods that assess tumor acidosis with CEST MRI, using exogenous CEST agents and endogenous sources of CEST contrast. We will apply our new methods to evaluate tumor acidosis in patients with breast, head & neck, lung, and brain cancers.

"Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study Project Summary/Abstract The developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood is marked by a mix of potential and vulnerability. A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during this critical period, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and the first signs of emotional disorders. It is important to understand detailed patterns of typical development, so alterations can be identified and rectified as early as possible. As an entirely noninvasive and quantitative imaging method, arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for functional brain development in both healthy populations and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, there remain significant challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying neurodevelopment, including: 1) a coarse spatial resolution of ~4x4x4mm3, 2) susceptibility to head motion with segmented 3D acquisitions, and 3) potential confounding effects of age dependent variations in arterial transit time using a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan. Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) or multiband (MB) is a new accelerated imaging technology that simultaneously excites multiple slices and recovers each slice with parallel imaging techniques. Preliminary studies combining MB with ASL showed that MB can reduce T1 relaxation of the label, improve spatial coverage and/or resolution compared to those of standard 2D ASL. MB imaging may also overcome the limitation of 3D ASL acquisitions in terms of head motion and spatial blurring. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing MB ASL is inferior to that of 3D ASL. This project builds on two recent innovations from our lab: 1) a constrained slice-dependent (CSD) background suppression (BS) technique that improves the SNR of 2D MB pCASL to be comparable to that of 3D pCASL; and 2) a single-shot 3D GRASE pCASL method with 2D CAIPIRINHA accelerations that improves the imaging speed of 3D pCASL. The goal of this R01 project is to develop and evaluate cutting-edge MB pCASL protocols that are able to offer a high spatial resolution of isotropic 2mm or higher, resistance to head motion and multi-delay capability for accurate perfusion quantification in pediatric populations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoising algorithm for multi-delay MB pCASL will be further developed. The developed suite of MB pCASL protocol and post- processing algorithms will be evaluated in 40 typically developing children and adolescents. The successful completion of this R01 project will lead to a robust multi-delay MB pCASL protocol that is highly valuable as potential biomarker for both neurodevelopment research and pediatric clinical care. To maximize the scientific and clinical impact, we will continue disseminating the pulse sequence and associated post-processing software as we have been doing in the past decade. Relevance to Public Health A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during the developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and emotional disorders.

"Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children Progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in childhood is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic bone disease, and death. Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), including posterior urethral valves, account for 50-60% of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children and are the most common cause of ESRD in this age group. In children with CAKUT, kidney injury is often already established at birth due to renal dysplasia. Some children, however, maintain preserved kidney function into adulthood while others progress to ESRD in childhood. Our ability to effectively implement therapies to slow CKD progression is limited by our lack of understanding of which patients are at greatest risk for CKD progression and therefore would be most likely to benefit from early intervention. Thus there is a need for biomarkers that can identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression. To identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression, we will develop novel computational methods to derive clinically informative biomarkers from ultrasound (US) imaging data using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and effectively integrate them with established clinical measures for early prediction of CKD progression. To achieve reliable and accurate kidney segmentation, Aim 1 develops an automatic kidney segmentation method by adopting fully CNNs, conditional random fields, and active contour models to simultaneously learn informative high-level image features and inter-voxel relationship under shape regularizations to improve the segmentation accuracy and robustness to imaging noise. To achieve improved prediction of CDK progression based on US imaging data, deep CNNs will be adopted to learn informative imaging features in a multi-instance learning framework to predict which children with CAKUT will develop CKD progression and their timing of progression in Aim 2. These techniques will be applied to a dataset of patients followed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, in order to derive individualized predictive indices of CKD progression. The proposed new techniques will allow us to early differentiate patients with distinct disease progression patterns. Fully automatic kidney ultrasound image segmentation and quantification methods will be developed using deep convolutional neural networks for early predicting chronic kidney disease progression",Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children,9669438,R21DK117297,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Bladder', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'End stage renal failure', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Bone Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Proteinuria', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urethra', 'Urinary tract', 'Urodynamics', 'age group', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'boys', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'kidney preservation', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized predictions', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'secondary analysis']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,262171,0.03764699148133662
"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career.

"A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT More people die every year from kidney disease than breast or prostate cancer. Kidney transplantation is life-saving but is limited by a shortage of organ donors and an unacceptably high donor organ discard rate. The decision to use or discard a donor kidney relies heavily on manual quantitation of key microscopic findings by pathologists. A major limitation of this microscopic examination is human variability and inefficiency in interpreting the findings, resulting in potentially healthy organs being deemed unsuitable for transplantation or potentially damaged organs being transplanted inappropriately. Our team developed the first Deep Learning model capable of automatically quantifying percent global glomerulosclerosis in whole slide images of donor kidney frozen section wedge biopsies. This innovative approach has the potential to transform donor kidney biopsy evaluation by improving pathologist efficiency, accuracy, and precision ultimately resulting in optimized donor organ utilization, diminished health care costs, and improved patient outcomes. The goal of this project is to establish our Deep Learning automated quantitative evaluation as the standard practice of donor kidney evaluation prior to transplantation. This will be achieved by assembling a team of expert kidney pathologists and computer scientists specializing in machine learning. The proposal will evaluate the accuracy and precision of the computerized approach to quantifying percent global glomerulosclerosis and compare these results with current standard of care pathologist evaluation. The feasibility of deploying the Deep Learning model to analyze whole slide images on the cloud will also be examined. The end product of this STTR will be a web-based platform to securely deploy Deep Learning image analysis as a tool to assist pathologists with donor kidney biopsy evaluation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Before a kidney can be transplanted, the tissue must be assessed under a microscope to ensure the organ is healthy enough for transplant. A major limitation of microscopic examination is human variability in interpreting the findings, resulting in healthy organs being deemed unsuitable for transplantation. This funding will support developing computer algorithms to assist pathologists in microscopic examination of donor kidney tissues, resulting in more consistent and objective biopsy interpretations, minimizing discard of potentially usable kidneys and optimizing organ placement for transplant.",A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies,9678574,R41DK120253,"['Address', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data Set', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Freezing', 'Frozen Sections', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Organ Donor', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Slide', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Speed', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Transplanted tissue', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'commercial application', 'computerized', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'glomerulosclerosis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'power analysis', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'standard of care', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NIDDK,"NEWVENTUREIQ, LLC",R41,2018,214009,0.03191781597216129
"MRI near Total Joint replacements Project Abstract Overview: The parent project for this supplement aims to provide routine MRI of subjects with total joint replacements by reducing the severe image artifacts near metal, while offering highly efficient patient-specific scans that can detect bone loss, infection, and temperature changes near the implant in clinically feasible scan times. The supplement aims to incorporate deep learning techniques to better meet the parent grant goals. Relevance: Total joint replacements are one of the most successful orthopedic procedures, used annually to reduce pain from joint diseases in about one million patients in the United States (a number projected to double by 2030). However, about 10% of joint replacements fail in 5-10 years due to bone loss (osteolysis), infection, or other complications, often leading to revision surgery. Accurate, early, non-invasive assessment of complications remains limited, but would offer earlier and less invasive treatments, reduce unnecessary surgery, or allow better surgical planning. Approach: Prior to, and during the parent grant period, we have developed novel “multi-spectral imaging” (MSI) MRI techniques that allow visualization of pathology adjacent to metallic implants, and together with other groups have successfully applied them to imaging of patients with devices including joint replacements and spinal fixation hardware. However these methods remain slow, have limited spatial resolution, and are challenging to use routinely. The recent growth of the machine learning field including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and its application to medical imaging offers unique opportunities to substantially improve MRI near metal, and specifically the goals of the parent grant. We propose 3 small, independent aims in the supplement: (1) to bring fast, isotropic imaging near metal to clinical practice by using CNN-based methods to reduce reconstruction times to under 30 seconds, (2) to improve image quality away from metal by using a new reconstruction and CNN to avoid needing standard imaging in addition to MSI methods and (3) to reduce background-gradient induced artifacts near to metal using a CNN-based approach to enable better diagnosis of abnormalities adjacent to metal. Summary: We aim to supplement our parent grant with CNN-based approaches to speed up scanning and image reconstruction, and to improve image quality near to and way from metal. These techniques will allow routine, non-invasive evaluation for earlier and more accurate detection and treatment of complications in these patients, as well as numerous other applications of MRI near metal implants. Project Narrative There is a growing need for accurate diagnosis of complications surrounding joint arthroplasty, where MRI would provide excellent contrast if not for the fact that the presence of metal severely degrades images. Building on recent ideas in MRI and deep learning, we propose to develop practical methods for routine clinical imaging of patients with metal implants by increasing speed as well as offering image contrast that shows infection and other complications near the metal devices. Ultimately these methods will be tested and offered for widespread use to enable earlier and better treatment of complications resulting from arthroplasty, as well as for better understanding of the implications of different devices.",MRI near Total Joint replacements,9750463,R01EB017739,"['Address', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Infection', 'Joint repair', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Osteolysis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Spinal', 'Stretching', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'arthropathies', 'bone loss', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'cluster computing', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'field study', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'pain reduction', 'parent grant', 'parent project', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'spectrograph']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,156870,0.013542334997194701
"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder.

"Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement ABSTRACT This proposal aims to develop deep learning methods to automate the extraction of morphological imaging features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA), and total knee replacement. While, quantitative evaluation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in OA research in the clinical setting MR reports often tend to be subjective, qualitative, and the grading schemes utilized in epidemiological research are not used because they are extraordinarily time consuming and do not lend themselves to the demands of todays changing healthcare scenario. The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements.

"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9418599,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'forest', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'predictive test', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,336980,0.045280414968393426
"Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI Project Summary/Abstract Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) provides arguably the most comprehensive evaluation of the cardiovascular system; however, respiratory motion continues to adversely impact CMR, causing artifacts that lead to poor image quality, repeated scans, and decreased throughput, and thus represents a significant obstacle to clinical utility. For single-shot CMR, cardiac and breathing motions are “frozen” by limiting the acquisition to an end-diastolic window less than 200 ms. For first pass perfusion, breathing motion cannot be eliminated because data from 50 to 60 consecutive heartbeats are required to capture contrast dynamics. For other single-shot applications such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and parameter mapping, respiratory motion is introduced when the acquisition is repeated across several heartbeats to improve spatial and temporal resolution. To eliminate respiratory motion from single-shot images, non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) has been promoted as an attractive option that provides 100% acquisition efficiently. MOCO can be used either after the reconstruction or during the reconstruction. Such techniques, however, cannot account for through-plane motion, which can only be corrected prospectively, and can fail depending on image quality and the extent of motion. Prospective compensation of the respiratory motion has been recognized as an attractive alternative to existing gating and MOCO methods. Proposed methods use one or more navigator echoes—incompatible with or inefficient for many CMR protocols—to capture the respiratory motion and rely on simple parametric models that are inadequate to describe complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion. Due to these limitations, prospective methods have found limited applicability even in research settings. We propose a new framework to prospectively compensate respiratory motion. The proposed method, called PROspective Motion compensation using Pilot Tone (PROMPT), employs Pilot Tone technology and leverages machine learning principles to first learn complex respiratory-induced cardiac motion on a patient-specific basis and then prospectively compensate the motion by tracking the imaging plane, in real time, as a function of a Pilot Tone based respiratory signal. If successful, this synergistic combination of Pilot Tone and machine learning will lead to 100% efficiency for single-shot CMR exams performed under free-breathing conditions, will eliminate the need to setup navigator echoes, respiratory bellows, or other inefficient prospective gating measures, will minimize through-plane motion that can render the images non-diagnostic for CMR applications including fast-pass perfusion, parameter mapping, LGE, and coronary angiography, will provide a reliable surrogate measure of respiratory motion, and will facilitate highly accelerated compressive recovery. Project Narrative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many potential advantages over currently used imaging methods to diagnose heart disease, but MRI images can be ruined if the patient breathes during the scan. In this project, we will develop a method that is insensitive to breathing motion and compare it to existing methods. These efforts should lead to significant improvements in diagnosis of heart disease so that patients may benefit from appropriate treatment.",Prospective Slice Tracking for Cardiac MRI,9587091,R21EB026657,"['Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Freezing', 'Gadolinium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'healthy volunteer', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,185264,0.04102224863166399
"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad. Our goal is to more accurately characterize the complex shape and motion patterns of cardiac dyssynchrony, through new machine learning technology applied to dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. We envision that our findings would further improve both our understanding of cardiac dyssynchrony in relation to heart failure and the ability to predict its response to resynchronization therapy, potentially leading to new clinical guidelines and improved clinical outcomes.",Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony,9475862,R01HL127661,"['Apical', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Selection Criteria', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'effective therapy', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2018,589455,0.05501336008208719
"Predicting contrast enhancement in multiple sclerosis with real time texture analysis Description: Identification of active lesions is critical for the management of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Currently this identification is based on post-contrast T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, there are safety concerns with repeated administration of gadolinium –based contrast agents (GBCAs). Thus, there is critical need for identifying active lesions without the use of GBCA. In this application we propose to identify the active lesions without administering GBCA using texture analysis (TA) using multi- modal non-contrast MRI and support vector machine (SVM) learning. A unique feature of this proposal is that the results will be analyzed using MRI data acquired on a large cohort of MS patients (~1000) as a part of phase III, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial (CombiRx). In addition texture features will be identified that can predict lesions that convert into tissue destructive lesions, so called black holes. This has important clinical implications since there is correlative evidence that balk holes are associated with clinical disability. A novelty of this project lies in performing texture analysis in real time that allows the physician to make the decision about administering GBCA on the spot while the patient is still in the scanner. This greatly helps in eliminating and/or minimizing the number of times GBCA needs to be administered. For real time analysis, the necessary infrastructure that includes automatic processing pipeline and integration of the MRI scanner with high performance computational resources located at Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) in Austin. Finally to establish real time TA as a viable alternative to GBCA administration for identifying active lesions, the developed methods will be prospectively applied to MS patients undergoing MRI scans as a part of routine clinical management. Public health relevance: Gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCAs) are routinely used for identifying active lesions in multiple sclerosis patients. However, there are safety concerns with repeated administration of GBCA. This proposal uses novel real time analysis for identifying lesions that are likely to enhance on pre- contrast MRI. Considering the large number of MS patients who are frequently scanned with GBCA, this proposal has a high degree of clinical relevance.",Predicting contrast enhancement in multiple sclerosis with real time texture analysis,9650821,R56NS105857,"['Advanced Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Effectiveness', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Evaluation', 'Gadolinium', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neuraxis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protons', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Spottings', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texas', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'attenuation', 'austin', 'base', 'black hole', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'contrast enhanced', 'density', 'disability', 'high end computer', 'imaging facilities', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'prospective', 'public health relevance']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R56,2018,535749,0.013039642980734168
"Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by  Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging can provide safe, non-invasive, and whole-brain measurements for large clinical and research studies of brain disorders. However, many disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alterations, which are often difficult to tease out due to limited image quality afforded by the popular 3T MRI scanners (with 20,000+ units available worldwide). Although 7T MRI scanners provide better image quality, these ultrahigh field scanners are not widely available (with only 40+ units available worldwide) and are also not used clinically. Thus, tools for reconstructing 7T-like high-quality MRI from 3T MRI scan are highly desirable. A means for achieving this is by learning the relationship between 3T and 7T MRI scans from training samples. This renewal project is dedicated to developing a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels of 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD. Specifically, (Aim 1) to enhance the image quality of 3T MRI, we will develop a novel deep learning architecture to learn a complex multi-layer 3T-to-7T mapping from training subjects, each with coupled 3T and 7T MRI scans. This mapping will then be applied to reconstruct quality-enhanced 7T-like MRI scans from new 3T MRI scans. (Aim 2) For brain structural measurement (e.g., brain atrophies, and hippocampal volume shrinkage), a crucial step is brain tissue segmentation. We will thus develop a robust and accurate random forest tissue segmentation method, which maps 7T label information to 3T scans. The mapping function is trained using tissue labels generated for 7T scans, instead of 3T scans which often have limited image contrast. (Aim 3) To further quantify local atrophies in ROIs or even sub-ROIs (i.e., hippocampal subfields), we will develop a deformable multi-ROI segmentation method by employing (a) random forest to predict deformation from each image location to the target boundary by adaptive integration of multimodal (anatomical, structural & functional connectivity) information and (b) auto-context model to iteratively refine ROI segmentation results. Note that the adaptive integration of multimodal MRI data, especially resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), is critical to the segmentation of sub-ROIs such as hippocampal subfields, since local functional connectivity patterns can help distinguish boundaries between neighboring subfields that often have different cortico-cortical connections. (Aim 4) Finally, by integrating anatomical features from all accurately segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs and also structural & functional connectivity features between those segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs, we can more effectively detect early-stage brain disorders, i.e., the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. We will integrate information from different imaging datasets and multiple imaging centers by using our novel multi-task learning approach for jointly learning the respective disease prediction models. Applications. These computational methods will find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormalities associated with various neurological diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia), measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between imaging and clinical scores. Narrative Description of Project The goal of this renewal project is to achieve robust brain measurements from the routine 3T MRI, guided by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI. To this end, we will create a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels from 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new testing subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD.",Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI,9548265,R01EB006733,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'forest', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,1,0.012476358923992702
"Distinguishing Lipid Subtypes by Amplifying Contrast from J-Coupling Project Summary/Abstract With the global rise in obesity-related diseases and increasing recognition of the role of fat in diseases such as fatty liver, there is growing need for a noninvasive chemical assay of in vivo lipid depots. But the rich chemistry of these molecules is often ignored in MRI, which typically treats fat as a homogeneous proton species because differences in chemical shift and relaxation are difficult to distinguish in a clinical setting. Innovation: This proposal will be the first to use nonuniform echo spacing to generate J-coupling based contrast between chemically different fats. While fat spins often give monotonically decaying signal under a uniformly spaced spin echo train, J-coupling causes nonuniformly spaced spin echo trains to generate complex fingerprints, which distinguish and even quantify fats with otherwise similar MR properties. Significance: The immediate clinical impact will be to demonstrate a novel J-coupling based contrast mechanism in vivo which will contribute to a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish the 25% of the population with benign steatosis from the 2-3% with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The broader significance of this work is that this novel contrast mechanism could revolutionize the study and clinical management of many diseases associated with bioactive lipid subtypes. Approach: The aims are designed to test the hypothesis that nonuniform echo trains (1) can create contrast between different fats, which (2) will contribute to a multiparametric noninvasive protocol to distinguish benign steatosis and NASH. Aim 1 will identify the echo spacing best suited for distinguishing benign steatosis and NASH, first using density matrix simulations based on high resolution spectra of liver fat from animals with each disease, and then using experiments on whole rat livers. In Aim 2, the sequence developed in Aim 1 will be tested in humans with biopsy proven benign steatosis or NASH, along with a suite of standard methods of liver and fat characterization. This metric, and also metrics derived from conventional images, will be tested for the ability to separate these patient groups. In addition, machine learning algorithms will be used to find a metric that combines multiecho intensities with standard MR metrics. This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains as a new contrast mechanism and yield a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis and NASH. Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes. The results of this work will justify a larger scale study to properly validate the sensitivity to different fat species in humans. Project Narrative This proposal will prove the usefulness of nonuniform echo trains both as a new J-coupling based contrast mechanism and as part of a multiparametric MRI protocol to distinguish simple steatosis (~25% of the population) from patients on the NASHfibrosiscirrhosis trajectory of metabolically induced liver disease (2- 3% of the population). Moreover, this general approach to distinguish fats could ultimately find a broad range of biomedical applications, such as imaging lipid based therapeutics, distinguishing the 4 fatty acids that make up 90% of the adipose stores, or detecting other lipotoxic subtypes.

"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9475874,R01HL133616,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational algorithm', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Institution', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Language', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Reader', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Visceral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'coronary artery calcium', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary vasculature', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'routine imaging', 'sudden cardiac death']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,653101,0.030090246889999263
"Nephrotic Syndrome Rare Disease Clinical Research Network II ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to certain immunosuppressive medications, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of over 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage novel analysis tools to analyze the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify subgroups of patients with shared expression profiles. And, to combine this data with clinical characteristics and kidney biopsy pathology features to predict response to immunosuppressive therapy. It will utilize advanced analysis techniques which are ideal for rare disease when traditional statistical methods are not well equipped to identify relevant predictors from the large number of potential parameters across the genotype-phenotype continuum. The aims are: Aim 1: To utilize consensus non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) on glomerular and tubular genome wide mRNA expression data to identify functional subclasses of NEPTUNE participants. Aim 2: To utilize machine learning algorithms to identify predictors of response to initial immunosuppressive therapy from clinical characteristics, kidney biopsy pathology features and gene expression clusters. The objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by identifying novel, biologically-relevant predictors of treatment response. Risk stratification is useful not only to inform patients and clinicians who are making treatment decisions, but also allows stratification of patients at high risk of treatment failure into clinical trials of novel agents. LAY NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the significant toxicity from the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use clinical characteristics, gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue and pathology features from the kidney biopsy to quantify the likelihood that an individual person will fail to respond to immunosuppressive medications. This approach, if validated, may help to inform patients and clinicians about the risk of treatment failure.",Nephrotic Syndrome Rare Disease Clinical Research Network II,9716867,U54DK083912,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Edema', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis', 'Gene Expression', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Swelling', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'genetic signature', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'individual response', 'mRNA Expression', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U54,2018,71580,0.006362235295199201
"2018 In Vivo Magnetic Resonance Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar PROJECT SUMMARY  The field of magnetic resonance (MR) is in the midst of a revolution. Disruptive external forces, such as the advent of powerful new Artificial Intelligence methods, coupled with a recent creative ferment in method development within the field, is changing the way we think about the acquisition, the reconstruction, and the interpretation of MR data. Meanwhile, MR has long been an indispensable tool not only for basic discovery but also for medical diagnostics, but the value proposition of clinical MR imaging is also changing, against the backdrop of a shifting healthcare landscape.  There is a palpable need to explore the full scope of these changes, in a forum that enables deep dives and focused discussion, without losing the necessary breath of perspective. While large meetings such as the annual scientific meeting of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) have the necessary breath, the sheer size and pace of such meetings work against the requisite focus. On the other hand, short focused workshops are better suited to the evaluation of progress in well-defined subfields.  The goal of this grant application is to support a high-impact conference with a time-tested format which is ideally suited to assess recent changes in the field of in vivo MR. The tenth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance will be held July 15 to 20, 2018, at Proctor Academy, in Andover, NH. Our GRC will also be associated with the first-ever trainee-organized and trainee-focused Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance, which will take place on the weekend before the GRC (July 14-15, 2018). The trainee seminar meshes well with our goal of preparing young scientists for a changing field and a changing world. We request funding to support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows attending these meetings, which will focus explicitly on the shifting role of MR in a rapidly changing world.  The GRC, subtitled “Challenging assumptions about MR technology and applications in a changing world,” will be led by Chair Daniel K. Sodickson, MD, PhD, and Vice Chair Jeff F. Dunn, PhD, and will build upon a rich history of In Vivo MR GRCs. The GRS, subtitled “The Changing World of Magnetic Resonance: Old Physics, New Techniques,” will be led by Chair Scott Beeman, PhD, and Vice Chair Carson Hoffman, BSc, and will further enhance the experience of trainees with tailored opportunities for mentorship, networking, and scientific exchange.  Specific aims of our 2018 GRC and GRS on In Vivo MR are as follows:  1. Explore disruptive forces and marshal disruptive innovation in the field of in vivo MR  2. Foster connections between MR and surrounding disciplines  3. Prepare young scientists to make a difference in a rapidly changing world PROJECT NARRATIVE Support is requested for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the tenth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance, scheduled for July 15-20, 2018, and the inaugural trainee- focused Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) to precede the conference on July 14-15, 2018. The GRC will be focused on “Challenging assumptions about MR technology and applications in a changing world,” with the goal of taking the measure of disruptive forces such as Artificial Intelligence, and marshaling disruptive innovations in the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of MR data. The companion GRS will have a related focus on “The changing world of magnetic resonance: old physics, new techniques,” and will provide trainees (who will attend the GRC as well) with opportunities for presentation of their work to peers and thought leaders, discussion of emerging areas of MR, and focused networking and mentorship.",2018 In Vivo Magnetic Resonance Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar,9608839,R13EB026933,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Anniversary', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Books', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'International', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marshal', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Palpable', 'Physics', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'c new', 'commune', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'design', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'meetings', 'method development', 'peer', 'posters', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIBIB,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2018,5000,0.014527836607858235
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology.

"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism,9666652,K23NS105944,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical assessments', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Red nucleus structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Subjects Selections', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromelanin', 'neuron loss', 'nigrostriatal system', 'novel', 'pars compacta', 'patient screening', 'putamen', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2018,192564,0.026297427307144555
"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure, hyper- tension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deﬁcits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantiﬁcation will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and dos- ing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workﬂow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma ﬂow and arterial input function, are difﬁcult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from signiﬁcant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma ﬂow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast ﬂow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma ﬂow (RPF) that lever- age novel ﬂow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated imag- ing methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantiﬁcation is crucial for clinical management of these children.

"Automatic quantification of myocardial motion in older adults Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is a common condition that represents the end stage of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) subsequent to progressing myocardial damage or ischemia. In populations at ages 65 and older, coronary artery disease (CAD) serves as the leading cause of HF. Although low left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) is a major evidence for the diagnosis of HF in clinical practice, impaired regional myocardial dysfunction is expected to present the existence of CAD in its early stage.  Heart deformation analysis (HDA) is a cutting-edge myocardial motion analysis technique that is able to automatically track the myocardium borders on time frames and calculate global and regional cardiac functional and motional indices on existing cine images without extra scans. In the present study, we will use the HDA tool to analyze existing cine images of CHARISMA study. From 2009 to 2012, cardiac MRI exams (including coronary wall imaging and cine MRI at two-chamber, four-chamber and short-axis views) and concurrent tests for traditional cardiovascular risk factors were performed on 440 older participants (age: 65 - 84 years old at the time of MRI scans) without documented history of CVDs. During the present R03 project (2019-2021), CHARISMA participants would have been followed-up for 10 - 12 years. We plan to relate newly- acquired regional myocardial motion indices (displacement, velocity, strain and strain rate) to clinical outcomes, existing coronary wall measures and results of lab tests in CHARISMA datasets. We will test the overall hypothesis that regional myocardial motion indices have the potential to present cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic elderly. Three specific aims are: 1) Predict cardiovascular events using baseline regional myocardial motion indices; 2) Relate regional myocardial motion indices to MRI-derived features of coronary remodeling; and 3) Determine correlations between regional myocardial motion indices and traditional cardiovascular risk biomarkers/conditions collected in CHARISMA study.  No new MRI scans or lab tests are required in this project. Through a cost-effective approach, the immediate objective of the proposed project is to evaluate the clinical value of regional myocardial motion for cardiovascular risk stratification in asymptomatic older adults, a major target population of cardiovascular prevention. This study will also help us better understand the correlations between impaired myocardial function/motion and subclinical CAD burden. Furthermore, the results will facilitate the selection of quantitative imaging biomarkers and their optimal cut-off points for predicting cardiovascular events in future clinical studies. Project Narrative  In the present study, we will use heart deformation analysis (HDA) to reanalyze existing cardiac MRI data of CHARISMA study.

"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules. In this proposal we will perform high-content, high throughput screening for kidney regeneration in zebrafish to discover novel chemical probes to investigate mechanisms of augmented kidney regeneration after injury.",High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs,9406857,R01DK112652,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fibrosis', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Microsomes', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Organogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Prodrugs', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Renal tubule structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'kidney repair', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'organ growth', 'organ regeneration', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,351001,0.005344363543557365
"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,9524416,R01EB016695,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,598063,0.012242823039784249
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9517057,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'success', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2018,169609,0.028205938285865685
"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia. After considerable progress reducing the depth and duration of anes- thesia, this work aims to reduce the frequency of anesthesia through a synergistic combination of fast, quiet, motion-robust, automated, and adaptive scanning. This will make MRI safer, cheaper, and more widely available to children, reducing the population risk of radiation from CT.",Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI,9595406,R01EB009690,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body Image', 'Body part', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Breathing', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Technique', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'community setting', 'compliance behavior', 'contrast enhanced', 'design and construction', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'programs', 'radiation risk', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,703347,0.05025667689630807
"Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract The applicant Udo Hoffmann MD MPH is a Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and the Chief of the Division for Cardiovascular Imaging in the Department of Radiology at MGH. Dr. Hoffmann has established a patient oriented research (POR) program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research methods to demonstrate the value of advanced cardiovascular imaging. Dr. Hoffmann has published approximately 380 peer reviewed papers, among them many in premier medical journals and has received continued independent, peer-reviewed POR NIH funding since 2005. He is among the very few faculty members at Harvard Medical School who are both the PI and Director of a highly successful NHLBI funded T- 32 program (Cardiac MR and CT Research) and a recipient of a K24. Dr. Hoffmann has successfully mentored more than 60 clinical investigators, most of which currently hold faculty positions in major academic centers and actively perform POR. Moreover, Dr. Hoffmann has successfully accomplished all mentoring and scientific goals of the first K24 award period. Overall, these achievements document Dr. Hoffmann's long standing passion and commitment to POR. His excellent publication, funding, and mentoring record together with his current and planned research support provide an excellent foundation to accomplish the aims of this competitive renewal of the K24 Award “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. Dr. Hoffmann proposes a mentoring and research plan that utilizes the synergies of past, ongoing, and future highly innovative independent research projects with educational and training opportunities offered by the cardiac MR CT PET Program, the T32 training program in cardiovascular imaging, the Harvard CTSA, and the Harvard School of Public Health. The specific aims addressing the charge of the K24 Award are to enable Dr. Hoffmann to: 1) dedicate 25% of his time to mentor clinical investigators based on NIH or equivalent funded projects in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”, 2) to mentor junior and mid-career clinical investigators with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants, and 3) to continue to expand a POR program that combines translational, clinical, and outcomes research to develop future leaders in clinical research in cardiovascular imaging and beyond. The research plan encompasses four specific aims: 1) To determine the effects of statin treatment on coronary atherosclerosis in HIV patients in 800 patients with HIV randomized to statin therapy vs. placebo, 2) To determine whether high risk coronary plaque predicts cardiovascular events in 4600 patients with clinical suspicion of CAD, 3) To determine the cost effectiveness of CT FFR in patients with stable and acute chest pain, and 4) To use Radiomics to identify novel imaging markers predicting cardiovascular events in participants of the Framingham Heart Study. Narrative This research takes advantage of a rich body of independent funded research in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. It will permit Dr. Hoffmann to dedicate 25% of his time to mentor junior clinical investigators from the T32 program and the pool of residents, fellows, and junior faculty in Cardiology and Radiology with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants. In addition, it will allow to expand a patient orientated research program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research in cardiovascular imaging and that provides an ideal environment to develop future leaders in clinical research.",Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease,9475268,K24HL113128,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Area', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Charge', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Journals', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peer Review Grants', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Risk stratification', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'career', 'comparative effectiveness', 'coronary plaque', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'effectiveness trial', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'member', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'sex', 'skills', 'synergism', 'training opportunity']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K24,2018,120852,0.029291258485483283
"System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion Summary BioInVision, Inc. and Case Western Reserve University researchers will develop software for quantitative anal- ysis of cardiac CT perfusion (CCTP), creating an important tool for evaluation of cardiovascular disease. With this product, cardiologists will be able to identify functional flow deficits in coronary artery territories. When one combines functional myocardial blood flow (MBF) with coronary anatomy from computed tomography angi- ography (CTA), it provides needed information on the physiologic significance of a stenosis. The CTA+CCTP combo could provide an ideal gateway exam for deciding whether to send a patient for percutaneous invasive coronary angiography and potential intervention (e.g., stenting). In addition, if flow is low and no stenosis is present, it will suggest microvascular disease, a very prevalent ailment of growing concern, especially among women and in diabetes. CT compares favorably to all other non-invasive cardiovascular imaging techniques (SPECT, PET, and MRI). It is available in many settings, including emergency departments. It provides both MBF and reliable coronary anatomy, not available in any other single modality. It has excellent resolution ena- bling detection of endocardial perfusion deficit, thought to be an early disease indicator that is impossible to assess with SPECT. CT is cheaper and has higher patient throughput than MRI or PET. With inclusion of MBF, CT would have an excellent opportunity to disrupt the diagnostic pathway leading to percutaneous intervention, a pathway now dominated by SPECT myocardial imaging, which includes zero information about coronary anatomy. To achieve reliable, accurate CT MBF measurements, we will invoke innovations to reduce beam hardening and to make reliable estimates of flow. Currently, CT perfusion is done on different CT machines with manufacturers’ proprietary software, using algorithms that can give erroneous MBFs. Applicable to any commercial scanner; our solution would harmonize measurements across acquisition systems providing trust- worthy, standardized measurements to clinicians, thereby improving management of cardiovascular patients. Narrative We will develop software to enable reliable evaluation of blood flow in heart tissue using CT imaging. With suc- cess, our project could lead to an improved gateway examination that could reduce unnecessary invasive cor- onary angiography, thereby reducing costs, patient discomfort, patient risk, and possibly unnecessary interven- tional therapies.",System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion,9622204,R41HL144271,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Attention', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary artery', 'Cost Savings', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Family suidae', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inferior', 'Intervention', 'Iodine', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardium', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Stents', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'blood flow measurement', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'perfusion imaging', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,"BIOINVISION, INC.",R41,2018,224240,0.01397660407846514
"Big data in acute renal rejection PROJECT SUMMARY  Background: Acute rejection of renal transplant, i.e., the immunological response of the human body to a foreign kidney, is the main cause of dysfunction in renal transplant patients, surpassing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and immune drug toxicity. Over 650,000 patients in the US have end-stage renal disease and renal transplant offers the best outcome for these patients. However, 15%-27% of renal transplant patients have ARTR within 5 years, which if not detected and treated promptly, causes renal damage and leads to renal failure of the transplanted kidney. Currently, ARTR is initially evaluated using blood tests and urine sampling, e.g., plasma creatinine and creatinine clearance. However, these indices have low sensitivity, since a significant change in creatinine levels is only detectable after the loss of 60% of renal function. ARTR diagnosis requires renal biopsy (gold standard), which is invasive, takes a week for diagnosis, and costs up to $20,000. Further, needle biopsy is prone to over- or under-estimation of inflammation. The proposed study seeks to develop and validate a new noninvasive computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) software system that can provide highly accurate (over 97% accuracy) diagnosis of ARTR at an early stage by integrating laboratory-based biomarkers (e.g., creatinine clearance (CrCl) and serum plasma creatinine (SPCr)) with imaging-markers that will be extracted from either dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) or diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI).  Objective/Hypotheses: The primary objective of this proposal is to develop and validate a clinically usable system for the early detection of acute renal transplant rejection (ARTR) based on testing the following three hypotheses: (i) The perfusion of the contrast agent in the cortex of the rejected kidney is slower than the perfusion of the contrast agent in the non-rejected kidney; (ii) The estimated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the cortex of the rejected kidney is smaller than the estimated ADC in the cortex of the non-rejected kidney; and (iii) Fusing laboratory-based biomarkers (e.g., CrCl and SPCr) with imaging-markers that will lead to novel fused indices for distinguishing rejected versus non-rejected kidneys in clinical decision-making.  Specific Aims: (i) Develop a software CAD system for early detection of acute renal transplant rejection based on integrating/fusing the estimated physiological perfusion parameters from DCE-MRI data with laboratory-based biomarkers for both rejected and non-rejected transplanted kidneys; (ii) Develop a software CAD system for early detection of acute renal transplant rejection based on integrating/fusing the estimated physiological diffusion parameters from DW-MRI data with laboratory-based biomarkers for both rejected and non-rejected transplanted kidneys; and (iii) Evaluate the accuracy of the proposed image analysis software system with clinical data that will be collected at University of Louisville (Approved IRB # 16.0041), University of Michigan (Approved IRB # HUM00115031), and the collected MRI data at The Kidney transplant center at Mansoura University with local regulatory approval.  Study Design: We will develop the following image analysis techniques to accurately analyze both DCE- MRI and DW-MRI: (i) segmentation of the kidney object from the surrounding abdominal structures for either DCE-MRI or DW-MRI using appearance and prior shape models; (ii) a Laplace-based non-rigid registration approach to handle local deformations in the kidney region caused by physiological effects (e.g., intrinsic pulsatile effects, breathing, or transmitted effects from adjacent structures, such as the bowel) during the data collection; (iii) segmentation of the kidney cortex and generation of either the physiological perfusion parameters (e.g., wash-in slope, wash-out slope, time-to-peak, and peak value) or physiological diffusion parameters (e.g., ADC); (iv) classification of the acute rejection versus non-rejection kidney status and evaluating the method as a diagnostic test; and (v) depiction of parametric maps of the estimated perfusion or diffusion indices to help clinical visual assessment of the transplanted kidney. The MRI and clinical data will be obtained from patients who have undergone kidney transplantation from live donors, and are available to our research team via Dr. Beache and Dr. Dwyer (Radiology Department and The Kidney Transplant Center at the University of Louisville, respectively) and Dr. Samaniego-Picota (Director of the Kidney Transplant Program and the Transplant Ambulatory Care Unit at the University of Michigan). In addition to the data that will be collected at the University of Louisville and the University of Michigan, our group has access to MRI data that had been collected from an additional 100 subjects at Mansoura University Hospital, Egypt. This data is available to our group through Dr. Abou El-Ghar, one of the PI collaborators, and it will be used to test the proposed CAD system on the data collected from another geographical area. Our preliminary diagnostic results, based on analysis of DCE-MRI data from 54 independent in-vivo cases using leave-one-subject-out approach were 98% accurate (sensitivity = 100.00%, specificity = 96%, and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) = 98%). Moreover, our preliminary results, based on the analysis of DW-MRI data from 75 independent in-vivo cases using leave-one-subject-out were 97% accurate (sensitivity = 98%, specificity = 96%, and DSC = 98%). These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed CAD system to complement current technologies such as nuclear imaging and ultrasonography to determine the type of kidney dysfunction post transplantation.

"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,9417961,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling Errors', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative cost effectiveness', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'heart function', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'post intervention', 'procedure cost', 'public health relevance', 'standard of care', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,658634,0.054143025772889194
"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease.

"Promoting Utilization of Kidneys by Improving Patient Level Decision Making ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Promoting Utilization of Kidneys by Improving Organ Acceptance Decision Making Only 15,652 of nearly 109,000 waitlisted patients for kidney transplant (KT) received one in 2014. More than six thousand died while waiting for a KT and more than two thousand became too sick to be transplanted. Patient survival, quality of life, and morbidity is significantly worse for those who remain on dialysis. The majority of kidneys that are transplanted are recovered from deceased donors. In 2014, while 12,664 kidneys were recovered for KT, 2,272 were discarded - most frequently due to being of marginal or low quality. Many of the discarded kidneys are believed to confer smaller survival gains than other procured kidneys. Previous studies show that the marginal kidneys offer survival benefits with respect to remaining on dialysis, but neglect quantification of these benefits to an individual patient. These studies ignore two major issues: (i) the low c-statistics of one and three year post-transplant patient and graft survival models; and (ii) dynamics of the organ offers and the current point based priority system for the waitlisted patients. Given these facts, from a decision maker's perspective, accepting or rejecting a low quality organ is not necessarily a well informed choice.  The proposed research takes a comprehensive approach in developing a survival model incorporating time on dialysis, recipient characteristics, transplant center characteristics, and donated kidney characteristics. It proposes to apply techniques from biostatistics and machine learning to improve model accuracy. The research further aims to quantify the dynamics of kidney availability of different quality organs, and model future kidney offers as a stochastic decision tree. The proposed computational engine for estimating the survival benefits of accepting or rejecting an offer will be transformative in clinical decision making. Moreover, th successful completion of the proposed research will provide a highly reliable approach to support kidney acceptance/rejection decisions. The research will be carried out by a trans- disciplinary team with expert knowledge in the transplant allocation system, decision methodologies, and clinical decision making. The research team will incorporate input from an external advisory board consisting of leaders and key stakeholders in kidney and pancreas transplant programs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The transplantation system in the United States discards hundreds of recovered kidneys annually.

"Multidimensional MRI-based Big Data Analytics to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder. In this project, we propose to develop a fully automatic image post-processing pipeline and multidimensional big data analyses based on machine learning techniques, with the aim to uncover latent information from complex dataset and with the ultimate goal of setting up a platform for OA precision medicine",Multidimensional MRI-based Big Data Analytics to Study Osteoarthritis,9385849,K99AR070902,"['Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'California', 'Cartilage', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Gait', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Institutes', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Scanning', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'bone', 'career development', 'cartilage degradation', 'connectome', 'data integration', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging scientist', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'kinematics', 'member', 'modifiable risk', 'morphometry', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'parallel processing', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'racial difference', 'repository', 'shape analysis', 'soft tissue', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K99,2017,94041,0.012125936789015634
"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9306637,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'forest', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,340545,0.045280414968393426
"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad. Our goal is to more accurately characterize the complex shape and motion patterns of cardiac dyssynchrony, through new machine learning technology applied to dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. We envision that our findings would further improve both our understanding of cardiac dyssynchrony in relation to heart failure and the ability to predict its response to resynchronization therapy, potentially leading to new clinical guidelines and improved clinical outcomes.",Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony,9281894,R01HL127661,"['Apical', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Selection Criteria', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'effective therapy', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2017,593963,0.05501336008208719
"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9310380,R01HL133616,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational algorithm', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Institution', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Language', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Reader', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Visceral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'routine imaging', 'sudden cardiac death']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,653101,0.030090246889999263
"Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by  Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging can provide safe, non-invasive, and whole-brain measurements for large clinical and research studies of brain disorders. However, many disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alterations, which are often difficult to tease out due to limited image quality afforded by the popular 3T MRI scanners (with 20,000+ units available worldwide). Although 7T MRI scanners provide better image quality, these ultrahigh field scanners are not widely available (with only 40+ units available worldwide) and are also not used clinically. Thus, tools for reconstructing 7T-like high-quality MRI from 3T MRI scan are highly desirable. A means for achieving this is by learning the relationship between 3T and 7T MRI scans from training samples. This renewal project is dedicated to developing a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels of 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD. Specifically, (Aim 1) to enhance the image quality of 3T MRI, we will develop a novel deep learning architecture to learn a complex multi-layer 3T-to-7T mapping from training subjects, each with coupled 3T and 7T MRI scans. This mapping will then be applied to reconstruct quality-enhanced 7T-like MRI scans from new 3T MRI scans. (Aim 2) For brain structural measurement (e.g., brain atrophies, and hippocampal volume shrinkage), a crucial step is brain tissue segmentation. We will thus develop a robust and accurate random forest tissue segmentation method, which maps 7T label information to 3T scans. The mapping function is trained using tissue labels generated for 7T scans, instead of 3T scans which often have limited image contrast. (Aim 3) To further quantify local atrophies in ROIs or even sub-ROIs (i.e., hippocampal subfields), we will develop a deformable multi-ROI segmentation method by employing (a) random forest to predict deformation from each image location to the target boundary by adaptive integration of multimodal (anatomical, structural & functional connectivity) information and (b) auto-context model to iteratively refine ROI segmentation results. Note that the adaptive integration of multimodal MRI data, especially resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), is critical to the segmentation of sub-ROIs such as hippocampal subfields, since local functional connectivity patterns can help distinguish boundaries between neighboring subfields that often have different cortico-cortical connections. (Aim 4) Finally, by integrating anatomical features from all accurately segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs and also structural & functional connectivity features between those segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs, we can more effectively detect early-stage brain disorders, i.e., the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. We will integrate information from different imaging datasets and multiple imaging centers by using our novel multi-task learning approach for jointly learning the respective disease prediction models. Applications. These computational methods will find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormalities associated with various neurological diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia), measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between imaging and clinical scores. Narrative Description of Project The goal of this renewal project is to achieve robust brain measurements from the routine 3T MRI, guided by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI. To this end, we will create a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels from 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new testing subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD.",Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI,9372271,R01EB006733,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'contrast imaging', 'disease diagnosis', 'forest', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'research study', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,481714,0.012476358923992702
"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules. In this proposal we will perform high-content, high throughput screening for kidney regeneration in zebrafish to discover novel chemical probes to investigate mechanisms of augmented kidney regeneration after injury.",High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs,9262478,R01DK112652,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fibrosis', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Microsomes', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Organogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Prodrugs', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Renal tubule structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'kidney repair', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'organ growth', 'organ regeneration', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,348188,0.005344363543557365
"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9300962,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'virtual', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2017,169609,0.028205938285865685
"Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract The applicant Udo Hoffmann MD MPH is a Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and the Chief of the Division for Cardiovascular Imaging in the Department of Radiology at MGH. Dr. Hoffmann has established a patient oriented research (POR) program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research methods to demonstrate the value of advanced cardiovascular imaging. Dr. Hoffmann has published approximately 380 peer reviewed papers, among them many in premier medical journals and has received continued independent, peer-reviewed POR NIH funding since 2005. He is among the very few faculty members at Harvard Medical School who are both the PI and Director of a highly successful NHLBI funded T- 32 program (Cardiac MR and CT Research) and a recipient of a K24. Dr. Hoffmann has successfully mentored more than 60 clinical investigators, most of which currently hold faculty positions in major academic centers and actively perform POR. Moreover, Dr. Hoffmann has successfully accomplished all mentoring and scientific goals of the first K24 award period. Overall, these achievements document Dr. Hoffmann's long standing passion and commitment to POR. His excellent publication, funding, and mentoring record together with his current and planned research support provide an excellent foundation to accomplish the aims of this competitive renewal of the K24 Award “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. Dr. Hoffmann proposes a mentoring and research plan that utilizes the synergies of past, ongoing, and future highly innovative independent research projects with educational and training opportunities offered by the cardiac MR CT PET Program, the T32 training program in cardiovascular imaging, the Harvard CTSA, and the Harvard School of Public Health. The specific aims addressing the charge of the K24 Award are to enable Dr. Hoffmann to: 1) dedicate 25% of his time to mentor clinical investigators based on NIH or equivalent funded projects in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”, 2) to mentor junior and mid-career clinical investigators with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants, and 3) to continue to expand a POR program that combines translational, clinical, and outcomes research to develop future leaders in clinical research in cardiovascular imaging and beyond. The research plan encompasses four specific aims: 1) To determine the effects of statin treatment on coronary atherosclerosis in HIV patients in 800 patients with HIV randomized to statin therapy vs. placebo, 2) To determine whether high risk coronary plaque predicts cardiovascular events in 4600 patients with clinical suspicion of CAD, 3) To determine the cost effectiveness of CT FFR in patients with stable and acute chest pain, and 4) To use Radiomics to identify novel imaging markers predicting cardiovascular events in participants of the Framingham Heart Study. Narrative This research takes advantage of a rich body of independent funded research in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. It will permit Dr. Hoffmann to dedicate 25% of his time to mentor junior clinical investigators from the T32 program and the pool of residents, fellows, and junior faculty in Cardiology and Radiology with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants. In addition, it will allow to expand a patient orientated research program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research in cardiovascular imaging and that provides an ideal environment to develop future leaders in clinical research.",Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease,9314834,K24HL113128,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Area', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Charge', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Journals', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peer Review Grants', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Risk stratification', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'career', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'effectiveness trial', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'member', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'sex', 'skills', 'synergism', 'training opportunity']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K24,2017,121969,0.029291258485483283
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,9229057,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling Errors', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative cost effectiveness', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'post intervention', 'public health relevance', 'standard of care', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,680651,0.054143025772889194
"Promoting Utilization of Kidneys by Improving Patient Level Decision Making ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Promoting Utilization of Kidneys by Improving Organ Acceptance Decision Making Only 15,652 of nearly 109,000 waitlisted patients for kidney transplant (KT) received one in 2014. More than six thousand died while waiting for a KT and more than two thousand became too sick to be transplanted. Patient survival, quality of life, and morbidity is significantly worse for those who remain on dialysis. The majority of kidneys that are transplanted are recovered from deceased donors. In 2014, while 12,664 kidneys were recovered for KT, 2,272 were discarded - most frequently due to being of marginal or low quality. Many of the discarded kidneys are believed to confer smaller survival gains than other procured kidneys. Previous studies show that the marginal kidneys offer survival benefits with respect to remaining on dialysis, but neglect quantification of these benefits to an individual patient. These studies ignore two major issues: (i) the low c-statistics of one and three year post-transplant patient and graft survival models; and (ii) dynamics of the organ offers and the current point based priority system for the waitlisted patients. Given these facts, from a decision maker's perspective, accepting or rejecting a low quality organ is not necessarily a well informed choice.  The proposed research takes a comprehensive approach in developing a survival model incorporating time on dialysis, recipient characteristics, transplant center characteristics, and donated kidney characteristics. It proposes to apply techniques from biostatistics and machine learning to improve model accuracy. The research further aims to quantify the dynamics of kidney availability of different quality organs, and model future kidney offers as a stochastic decision tree. The proposed computational engine for estimating the survival benefits of accepting or rejecting an offer will be transformative in clinical decision making. Moreover, th successful completion of the proposed research will provide a highly reliable approach to support kidney acceptance/rejection decisions. The research will be carried out by a trans- disciplinary team with expert knowledge in the transplant allocation system, decision methodologies, and clinical decision making. The research team will incorporate input from an external advisory board consisting of leaders and key stakeholders in kidney and pancreas transplant programs.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The transplantation system in the United States discards hundreds of recovered kidneys annually. Many of the discarded kidneys are of marginal quality and are believed to confer smaller survival gains than other procured kidneys. The proposed research will take a comprehensive approach to accurately quantify patient survival and implications of accepting a kidney towards developing a decision support engine.

"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad. Our goal is to more accurately characterize the complex shape and motion patterns of cardiac dyssynchrony, through new machine learning technology applied to dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. We envision that our findings would further improve both our understanding of cardiac dyssynchrony in relation to heart failure and the ability to predict its response to resynchronization therapy, potentially leading to new clinical guidelines and improved clinical outcomes.",Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony,9043186,R01HL127661,"['Apical', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Selection Criteria', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'effective therapy', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2016,599020,0.05501336008208719
"Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for fast image acquisition speed has always been a perennial topic in the MRI community. To reduce the acquisition time for maximal spatial and temporal resolution, modern MRI protocols usually perform reduced acquisitions below the Nyquist rate. The reduced data is then used to reconstruct the image through advanced reconstruction techniques that leverage some prior information about the MRI system (e.g., parallel imaging) and/or MR signal (e.g., compressed sensing). Since such prior information is patient and system specific, recent techniques obtain the prior information using training data obtained through an empirical calibration procedure. All existing methods assume the prior models are linear. Since the intrinsic nonlinear relationship in the training data cannot be characterized in such simple models, the reconstruction is degraded by the inaccuracy of the prior information. Nonlinear learning from the training data have proven to be more powerful in machine learning because it is more general and includes the linear model as a special case. However, it is usually more challenging to learn the nonlinear models and even more challenging to incorporate the model in reconstruction due to the increased degree of freedom. We recently have introduced a novel concept of ""kernel"" in MR reconstruction to address the above challenges timely. Our preliminary results on parallel imaging and sparsity-constrained reconstruction demonstrate that the kernel-based algorithms improve the reconstruction quality over the original algorithms with linear prior models. Built upon our strong preliminary results, the objective of this application is to develop an innovative kernel-based framework for MR image reconstruction from undersampled data. This framework does not require explicit knowledge of nonlinear mapping (as in preliminary work) such that a broader family of nonlinear functions can be explored for different clinical applications. The proposed work is expected to advance the field of MR image reconstruction vertically. Specifically, the successful completion of the proposed project will result in a general framework leading to many new algorithms (including two developed in this project) for reconstruction from reduced acquisition. Therefore, virtually all of current clinical MRI could benefit from the improved resolution, image quality, and/or reduced acquisition times that the new framework will facilitate or the novel applications i may enable. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is to develop a general framework and two specific new techniques to improve the spatial resolution and/or reduce the scan time in magnetic resonance imaging and evaluate the performance of the techniques for 3D parallel imaging and quantitative imaging in brain. The development of such novel fast imaging techniques may greatly enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. Therefore the project will potentially benefit numerous subjects and the healthcare system.",Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling,9119020,R21EB020861,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Family', 'Freedom', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Polynomial Models', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2016,222652,0.011234671231293934
"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9159185,R01HL133616,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational algorithm', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Institution', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reader', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Stenosis', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Visceral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'sudden cardiac death']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,671851,0.030090246889999263
"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease.

"Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During medical imaging, patient motion is virtually unavoidable presenting a significant source of image degradation and artifacts, which in turn, can impact the quality of care received by many patients. One method used to address patient motion is to employ visual tracking systems (VTS), which involves placing a small number of reflective markers on the patient that can be located and tracked in 3D space using stereo cameras. The tracked markers can then be used as a surrogate to a structure of interest, such as the heart. The tracked surrogate provides a quantifiable measure that can be directly correlated with the motion of the target structure, which can then be used for prospective or retrospective motion correction. However, the markers add complexity to patient workflow, provide only a sparse sampling of the patient's surface, and the optimal number and placement of markers is unknown. This project addresses the shortcomings of marker-based VTS systems by proposing to develop and test a novel low-cost marker-less VTS system for tracking patient motion within a hybrid imaging system. The primary barrier for successfully tracking the patient's body surface using marker-less VTS is that clothing prevents an unobstructed view of the patient's body. The candidate, Dr. Lindsay, is proposing to incorporate a translational method using computational approaches to compensate for garments within the proposed marker-less VTS system. Dr. Lindsay has received training in computer science and computer vision and previously has focused on the computational aspects of capturing, modeling, and rendering of physical phenomena such as light and is proposing to extend this knowledge to the medical imaging field. Dr. Lindsay's goals for this proposal are to acquire the necessary training and skills that will allow him to translate his expertise and existing computational skills to an area f research with medical relevance: namely, detecting and tracking patient motion for the purpose of improving motion correction for hybrid- imaging. Dr. Lindsay's long-term career goal is to become an accomplished independent investigator focusing on solving significant problems in medical imaging by translating advances in Computer Science. The proposed work will take place the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (UMass) in Worcester, MA under the primary mentorship of Dr. Michael King, an internationally known expert in the area of medical imaging and medical physics in Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Gennert, Sullivan, Licho have expertise in computer vision, mechanical engineering and medical imaging, and radiology and Nuclear Medicine, respectively will also serve as co-mentors.  The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) develop a novel marker-less VTS, which we call PT- Cam, using low-cost using state-of-the-art camera technology, 2) model surface motion as a surrogate for internal motion of the heart, and 3) conduct tests of the PT-Cam system, in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of clinical usage, on patients undergoing clinical MPI PET/CT imaging. Thus, the main objective of this program of research is to develop a clinically viable method for motion tracking patients undergoing hybrid-imaging studies by using a novel marker-less surface-tracking method that can compensate for clothing and provide modeling of interior motion of structures from surface tracking. If successful, not only will this project provide an innovative, marker-less VTS system for low-cost surface tracking for motion compensation during hybrid imaging but it will also give the candidate the necessary training needed to become an independent investigator in the medical field and potentially a leader in the field of medical imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 7.2 million people per year die world-wide from coronary artery disease (CAD), and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) has become a critical tool for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment of CAD. During medical imaging such as MPI, patient motion is virtually unavoidable and presents a significant source of image degradation and it has been suggested that upwards of 40% of cardiac studies in PET are effected by some type of motion with similar findings for SPECT. The proposed project will directly address the shortcomings of previous methods for tracking patient motion by developing and testing a novel low-cost marker-less visual tracking system for patient motion within hybrid imaging.",Body Surface Tracking of Complex Motion with Obstructed Viewing in Hybrid Imaging,9132242,K25EB019032,"['Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Body Surface', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clothing', 'Complex', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Optics', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'heart motion', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'skills', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'visual tracking', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,K25,2016,169609,0.028205938285865685
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,9004651,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Errors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'standard of care', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,658634,0.054143025772889194
"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad. Our goal is to more accurately characterize the complex shape and motion patterns of cardiac dyssynchrony, through new machine learning technology applied to dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. We envision that our findings would further improve both our understanding of cardiac dyssynchrony in relation to heart failure and the ability to predict its response to resynchronization therapy, potentially leading to new clinical guidelines and improved clinical outcomes.            ",Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony,8875394,R01HL127661,"['Apical', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Selection Criteria', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'effective therapy', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2015,634258,0.05501336008208719
"Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for fast image acquisition speed has always been a perennial topic in the MRI community. To reduce the acquisition time for maximal spatial and temporal resolution, modern MRI protocols usually perform reduced acquisitions below the Nyquist rate. The reduced data is then used to reconstruct the image through advanced reconstruction techniques that leverage some prior information about the MRI system (e.g., parallel imaging) and/or MR signal (e.g., compressed sensing). Since such prior information is patient and system specific, recent techniques obtain the prior information using training data obtained through an empirical calibration procedure. All existing methods assume the prior models are linear. Since the intrinsic nonlinear relationship in the training data cannot be characterized in such simple models, the reconstruction is degraded by the inaccuracy of the prior information. Nonlinear learning from the training data have proven to be more powerful in machine learning because it is more general and includes the linear model as a special case. However, it is usually more challenging to learn the nonlinear models and even more challenging to incorporate the model in reconstruction due to the increased degree of freedom. We recently have introduced a novel concept of ""kernel"" in MR reconstruction to address the above challenges timely. Our preliminary results on parallel imaging and sparsity-constrained reconstruction demonstrate that the kernel-based algorithms improve the reconstruction quality over the original algorithms with linear prior models. Built upon our strong preliminary results, the objective of this application is to develop an innovative kernel-based framework for MR image reconstruction from undersampled data. This framework does not require explicit knowledge of nonlinear mapping (as in preliminary work) such that a broader family of nonlinear functions can be explored for different clinical applications. The proposed work is expected to advance the field of MR image reconstruction vertically. Specifically, the successful completion of the proposed project will result in a general framework leading to many new algorithms (including two developed in this project) for reconstruction from reduced acquisition. Therefore, virtually all of current clinical MRI could benefit from the improved resolution, image quality, and/or reduced acquisition times that the new framework will facilitate or the novel applications i may enable.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is to develop a general framework and two specific new techniques to improve the spatial resolution and/or reduce the scan time in magnetic resonance imaging and evaluate the performance of the techniques for 3D parallel imaging and quantitative imaging in brain. The development of such novel fast imaging techniques may greatly enhance diagnosis of neurological disease. Therefore the project will potentially benefit numerous subjects and the healthcare system.            ",Kernel-based Nonlinear Learning for Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Sub-Nyquist Sampling,8953102,R21EB020861,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Family', 'Freedom', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2015,180330,0.011234671231293934
"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,8929292,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2015,132348,0.02092869347251744

Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,8797337,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Errors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,596707,0.054143025772889194
"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary. Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience. The microprobes we propose to develop represent a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology.",Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices,8850914,R01NS076462,"['Action Potentials', 'Adhesives', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bathing', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Caliber', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Chemicals', 'Child Development', 'Contralateral', 'Contrast Media', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Electroplating', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain research', 'density', 'design', 'electrical potential', 'improved', 'information processing', 'magnetic field', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural stimulation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'research study', 'sensor', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'voltage']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2015,392217,0.031083981788930952
"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications.              PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,8700987,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2014,132121,0.02092869347251744
"Segmentation and volumetric quantification of thalamic nuclei for assessing MS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The thalamus plays a key role in integrating sensory information for further processing in the basal ganglia and cortex. In multiple sclerosis (MS), long thought to be primarily a white matter disease, it has recently been shown that cognitive decline is more strongly related to thalamic volume than to white matter magnetic resonance image (MRI) lesion load. Since the thalamus is made up of nuclei having specific physical connections within the brain, it may be possible to relate physical changes in thalamic nuclei caused by MS to specific cognitive, behavioral, or disease subtype differences. This grant proposes to develop an automated method and associated software tool to carry out thalamic nuclei parcellation using MRI. Specifically, it is proposed to: 1) optimize the computation of thalamic features from anatomical and diffusion MRI; 2) develop an integrated, multi-nuclear thalamus segmentation algorithm; 3) optimize the algorithm parameters using manual delineations; and 4) carry out a pilot study using an existing MRI database comprising 99 normal controls and 226 MS patients. The work builds on previous methods that exploit topology and connectivity in order to improve segmentation robustness. The primary innovation is to provide a coordinated multi-object approach that integrates intensity information from T1-weighted MRI with orientation information and connectivity information obtained from diffusion MRI. Primary diffusion directions will be mapped to a five- dimensional space in order to cluster nuclei by diffusion orientation and use this information in the parcellation algorithm. A machine learning approach applied to manual delineations will be used to learn boundary-specific properties that will be used to carry out a joint parcellation approach. The algorithm will be designed for conventional three tesla clinical MRI and will be validated using high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio seven tesla MRI on 15 subjects scanned contemporaneously with their three tesla scans. The pilot study will use 822 scans of 305 participants, and will examine longitudinal stability of the algorithm and a cross-sectional univariate statistical analysis relatng thalamic nuclei (or nuclear groups) volumes to various clinical measures including disease subtype, disease duration, visual acuity, and two standard MS composite disability scores. An exploratory principal component analysis of multiple thalamic nuclear volumes will be carried out to look for patterns of atrophy and their relationships to various clinical measures. The algorithm will be made publicly available as open source code on the NITRC website so that the entire neuroscience community will be able to use the algorithm to study other diseases or modify and extend it for other applications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop software for the automatic segmentation and measurement of thalamic nuclei, which are thought to be affected by multiple sclerosis (MS). With this software applied to clinical magnetic resonance scans, the size of the thalamus and its nuclei will be available as biomarkers to track both the progression of MS and the success of its treatment.

"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation  SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with the status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation.

"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.

"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary.         Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience.

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase.

"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.

In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.  In Aim 3 we will perform a thorough evaluation of our system on 60 volunteers (30 adults and 30 children) and 120 patients (80 adults and 40 children).  SIGNIFICANCE - The impact of our technology has several facets.  First, it will improve patient care by reducing the number of MR images with compromised quality because of motion artifacts.  Especially because of the increasing reliance on MR Images as a primary means of diagnosis, this will reduce the number of misdiagnoses.  Secondly, this technology will help to lower the high national spending on imaging by dramatically improving the efficiency of MRI scanners.  Finally, it will improve patient comfort by reducing the need for repeat sequences, as well as reduce the necessity of sedation aimed at keeping the patient still.  Overall, this technology will have a significant impact on MRI both in clinical practice and basic science research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Synopsis Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.  This is not only of increasing concern due to the aging population and its associated diseases, but also in children and patients who are simply too sick to remain still during an exam.  This proposal aims to build an optical tracking system and methods to adapt MRI pulse sequences to changes in patient pose in real time.  The project leverages on previous work from an R21 project in which a prototype system was successfully built.  Specifically, the aims are to (i) introduce innovative improvements to the existing prototype, making the system suitable for use in clinical routine, (ii) modify the optical tracking system to be compatible with multiple MR sequences, and (iii) perform clinical evaluation.  Our real-time technique is a unique and innovative solution that will improve MRI image quality and thus patient care, and will address the escalating burden of imaging costs on the health care system.              Synopsis  Patient motion during an MRI exam can result in major degradation of image quality and decreased efficiency in a large portion of the 40 million MRI procedures performed annually.

"Noninvasive imaging-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to establish a strategy that will make neuronal electrical signaling detectable via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a whole-brain level. Our approach is built on the novel concept of using cell-adhesive micron-scale electronic devices to transduce neuronal potentials across the brain into magnetic field fluctuations. As part of our validation of these voltage-sensing microprobes, we also propose to implement a new, scalable method for simultaneous recording of MRI and electrophysiological data. The methods we propose to develop will be broadly applicable to problems in neurobiology, and will transform neuroscientists' ability to study integrative functions of the brain. Our microprobe approach will also help establish a new paradigm in diagnostic medicine and molecular imaging, where tiny machines, rather than conventional chemical contrast agents, will report on aspects of cellular physiology. Recent work has dem- onstrated that micron-scale electrodes, coated with cell-adhesive molecules and juxtaposed against cultured cells allow recording of millivolt-scale action potentials, comparable to intracellular recordings. The current induced in a microelectrode can be converted into a modest, transient magnetic field if it is channeled into an inductor. In Specific Aim 1, we will model the magnetic fields produced by feasible currents in spiral or solenoidal microcoils of defined geometry, compute predicted effects on MRI signal amplitude and phase as a function of microprobe distribution, and fabricate the microprobes themselves. Preliminary calculations indicate that localized, transient fields of about 10 nT could be produced in individual 10-turn microcoils of 1 5m diameter. Magnetic fields of this order are greater than endogenous neuronal fields detected in tech- nologies like magnetoencephalography, and have been shown previously to be measurable by MRI in some contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the ability of our microprobes to report action potentials from neu- ronal populations in MRI. The microdevices wil first be applied to cultured neurons or neural tissue slices and placed in an MRI scanner. Data series will be obtained using multiple protocols to detect variations of MRI signal due to variations in neuronal activity. If experiments in culture are successful, microprobes will be site-specifically injected into the cerebral cortex of anesthetized rats, and tested in an somatosensory stimu- lation paradigm. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish a simultaneous MRI and conventional electrophysiology approach to validate the novel MRI voltage probes directly. Performing electrophysiology in an MRI scanner is complicated by artifacts induced by the scanning hardware, in particular due to switched gradient fields. To circumvent this problem, we will measure neuronal potentials using differential recording from pairs of channels on tetrodes or modified tetrodes. Once the in-scanner recording method has been refined, MRI- based and conventional electrophysiology data will be obtained and compared to assess performance of the voltage-sensing microprobes, and to guide further improvements, if necessary.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Noninvasive MRI-based electrophysiology using microelectronic devices will have high impact in biology, and specifically in brain research, both through applications to the study of neurological disease and as tools for the analysis of neural network function in basic neuroscience.

"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects. In this grant, we will use modern brain imaging to identify specific mechanisms underlying progression to dementia. n/a",Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging,7894558,R01AG011378,"['6-hydroxybenzothiazole', 'Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease Pathway', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Amyloidosis', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Applications Grants', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Correlation Studies', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inositol', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scheme', 'Senile Plaques', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Spin Labels', 'Staging', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Syndrome', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'amyloid imaging', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'population based', 'primary outcome', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIA,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2010,1034999,-0.0020968803485262276
"Real-Time MRI Motion Correction System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MOTIVATION - Motion remains one of the most frequent contributors to image artifacts in MR studies.  The motion susceptibility of MRI is well-known and has spawned a number of elegant navigation techniques.  These methods, however, are tailored to specific MR acquisitions that require modified k-space trajectories or the acquisition of additional MR data, and most are unable to correct certain types of motion, for example, through-plane motion.  Moreover, motion correction has been focused on specific families of sequences, but no generally applicable approach currently exists.  Certain patient populations, such as pediatric or geriatric patients, are more likely to move than others.  In pediatric imaging, anesthesia is used to control motion, adding substantially to exam costs and patient risks.  A sequence-independent, autonomous and prospective motion correction system could greatly improve image quality for a wide spectrum of MR examinations.  For pediatric imaging, in particular, we anticipate reduced reliance on anesthesia to control patient motion.  AIMS - We will be focusing on three independent specific aims (carried out in parallel and completed within 4 years), with corresponding subaims that we believe are important for establishing the technical/scientific merit and to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed R&D efforts for our real-time adaptive motion correction approach.  Specifically, these aims are:  (1) to develop and evaluate a coil-mounted MR-compatible tracking device for routine clinical use; (2) to integrate pose tracking into real-time MRI; and (3) to validate our real-time motion correction system in volunteers and patients.  METHODS -In Aim 1 we will improve the methods for computer-vision-based pose estimation inside an MR scanner and build an MR-compatible coil-mounted pose tracker that can be used in clinical routine examinations.  In Aim 2 we will focus on reducing the latency between pose changes happening and the MR scanner reacting to these pose changes, and on building a software library for the MR pulse sequence development that allows one to implement real-time motion correction into all MR pulse sequences.

"AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 1 million people in the US will experience a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. A large percentage of these patients have no prior symptoms of any kind but suffer from silent heart disease (ischemia), which may cause a heart attack at any time. Currently there is no reliable screening method to identify people who may have silent heart disease and therefore are at risk of ""heart attack"".       We seek to extract additional data from a non-invasive Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the heart (commonly used in most imaging centers), which will better identify patients who are ""vulnerable"" to sudden heart attack. These images are acquired without contrast agents, as a common screening test for measuring coronary calcium, another clinical marker of coronary artery disease. We will prove that additional information about cardiovascular risk can be obtained by quantifying pericardial fat surrounding the heart in these cardiac CT images. Although this information exists in the cardiac CT scans acquired today, it is ignored in clinical practice because currently there are no tools to measure it automatically and reliably, and no information regarding its significance for a given patient.       We will develop fully automated, accurate, new computer software for quantitation of pericardial fat from cardiac CT images acquired for routine assessment of coronary calcium. We plan to achieve complete automation and accuracy, by applying a combination of robust and effective algorithms in machine learning with anatomical knowledge. We aim to prove that the developed automatic software will be as accurate, and more reproducible than experienced imaging physicians in quantifying pericardial fat, and will accomplish the measurement in a fraction of the time. Such software could be immediately made available worldwide to standard imaging workstations. For the first time, this will allow its use as a standard practical imaging tool for cardiovascular risk assessment, without requiring additional time, imaging or radiation risk to the patient.       We will also show that this new quantitative information has important additional value compared to other clinical cardiovascular risk factors and information from blood samples (such as cholesterol, glucose and CRP), and the amount of calcium in the patient's coronary arteries seen on CT scans, and establish its significance in the prediction of silent heart disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This new research will allow accurate prediction of who might be more likely to have heart disease which may ultimately cause a heart attack. It will allow doctors to identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed to avoid a heart attack, or more extensive testing, could be recommended, to confirm or rule out heart disease.          n/a",AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR,7588839,R21EB006829,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Biochemical', 'Blood specimen', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Pericardial body location', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visceral', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'indexing', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'waist circumference']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2009,196375,0.013330997565954527

"Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging tool but many important clinical applications are limited by long scan times and/or poor SNR. This proposal aims to improve the speed of MRI without losing SNR, through a Bayesian inference approach. Improvement in scan speed can enable new time-critical clinical and diagnostic MR applications, like cardiac imaging, time-resolved 4D coronary angiography, high-resolution volumetric brain imaging, dynamic contrast enhanced imaging, etc. A Bayesian framework for the reconstruction of raw MR data from multiple coils in parallel will be developed. This framework makes it possible to reduce the time taken during scanning multiple times by reducing the sampling rate of raw MR data. Our method will be generally applicable to most MR imaging modalities, targets and sampling schemes. Our method will then be validated and tested on the specific clinical application of volumetric structural brain imaging, which is an important procedure for the detection and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, tumors, white matter lesions, measuring brain atrophy and hippocampal subfields, etc. The main goal of this project is to create a set of computational tools to perform the reconstruction of accelerated MRI data on arbitrary imaging targets, modalities and acquisition schemes, including random sampling schemes. Design of models to capture prior spatial information about images will be undertaken. Finally, the method will be validated on structural brain data in terms of metrics like SNR, partial voluming, test- retest repeatability, and the performance of subsequent processing steps like image segmentation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project has the potential to make clinical MR imaging much faster than currently possible. This will make many time-critical clinical applications of MRI more feasible, for instance real-time MRI of the heart. The resolving power of MRI to image finer, clinically interesting anatomical features will also increase, making more reliable diagnosis possible.          n/a",Bayesian Parallel Imaging For Arbitrarily Sampled MR Data Using Edge-Preserving S,7688029,R21EB008138,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical application', 'combinatorial', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'expectation', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'model design', 'nervous system disorder', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'simulation', 'tumor', 'white matter']",NIBIB,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2009,211250,0.04148861247076796
"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 1 million people in the US will experience a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. A large percentage of these patients have no prior symptoms of any kind but suffer from silent heart disease (ischemia), which may cause a heart attack at any time. Currently there is no reliable screening method to identify people who may have silent heart disease and therefore are at risk of ""heart attack"".       We seek to extract additional data from a non-invasive Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the heart (commonly used in most imaging centers), which will better identify patients who are ""vulnerable"" to sudden heart attack. These images are acquired without contrast agents, as a common screening test for measuring coronary calcium, another clinical marker of coronary artery disease. We will prove that additional information about cardiovascular risk can be obtained by quantifying pericardial fat surrounding the heart in these cardiac CT images. Although this information exists in the cardiac CT scans acquired today, it is ignored in clinical practice because currently there are no tools to measure it automatically and reliably, and no information regarding its significance for a given patient.       We will develop fully automated, accurate, new computer software for quantitation of pericardial fat from cardiac CT images acquired for routine assessment of coronary calcium. We plan to achieve complete automation and accuracy, by applying a combination of robust and effective algorithms in machine learning with anatomical knowledge. We aim to prove that the developed automatic software will be as accurate, and more reproducible than experienced imaging physicians in quantifying pericardial fat, and will accomplish the measurement in a fraction of the time. Such software could be immediately made available worldwide to standard imaging workstations. For the first time, this will allow its use as a standard practical imaging tool for cardiovascular risk assessment, without requiring additional time, imaging or radiation risk to the patient.       We will also show that this new quantitative information has important additional value compared to other clinical cardiovascular risk factors and information from blood samples (such as cholesterol, glucose and CRP), and the amount of calcium in the patient's coronary arteries seen on CT scans, and establish its significance in the prediction of silent heart disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This new research will allow accurate prediction of who might be more likely to have heart disease which may ultimately cause a heart attack. It will allow doctors to identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed to avoid a heart attack, or more extensive testing, could be recommended, to confirm or rule out heart disease.          n/a",AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR,7470355,R21EB006829,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Biochemical', 'Blood specimen', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Invasive', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Pericardial body location', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Today', 'Visceral', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cysteine rich protein', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'human FAT protein', 'indexing', 'novel', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool', 'waist circumference']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2008,245025,0.013330997565954527

"Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Acute thrombus formation on disrupted/eroded human atherosclerotic lesions plays a critical role on the onset of acute coronary syndromes and progression of atherosclerosis. Pathological evidence has clearly established that it is plaque composition rather than stenotic severity that modulates plaque vulnerability and thrombogenicity. Therefore, the possibility of detecting and characterizing atherosclerotic lesions would have significant clinical implications. Among the different imaging modalities, MRI seems to be the most promising in terms of discrimination and due to its non-invasive nature. We propose to develop an automated MRI image analysis system for detecting, measuring, and classifying atherosclerotic plaques. The proposed project will be conducted by a highly experienced team of experts in signal processing, pattern recognition, statistics, and product development in close collaboration with key cardiovascular researchers, with specific expertise in MRI imaging and atherosclerosis. Automation would establish a fast, objective (observer-independent), and standard diagnostic measure of plaque burden, allowing for comparison of results between laboratories, throughout longitudinal studies, and across different imaging equipment. In a clinical setting, this system would greatly reduce the diagnostic costs involved in measuring the degree of stenosis and detecting thrombosis-prone plaques. n/a",Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI,6951380,R44HL071470,"['artificial intelligence', 'atherosclerotic plaque', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical automation', 'cardiovascular disorder diagnosis', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'human data', 'image processing', 'informatics', 'magnetic resonance imaging']",NHLBI,ISCHEM CORPORATION,R44,2005,374972,0.03209343892046894
"Reconstruction Hardware for Real-Time Moving Tabel MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall goal of this project is to design and integrate instrumentation allowing the next generation of real-time image formation in MRI. The motivation comes from an existing project for forming MR images during continuous motion of the patient table. When applied to peripheral MR angiography the target is the formation of a moving table angiogram in which the table motion is precisely matched to the transit of the contrast bolus through the patient. However, implementation of this requires that a number of mathematical processes be done at high speed, including: (i) time-resolved 3D MRI of an extended field of view (FOV); (ii) determination of localized time-dependent parameters such as bolus arrival time and bolus velocity; (iii) variable ordering of phase encodings over the course of an MRI scan, allowing optimized local resolution; (iv) gradient warping correction for MR acquisition done using a moving patient table; (v) multi-coil reconstruction using the SENSE technique, allowing improved lateral resolution for a given acquisition time; (vi) MR acquisition done using a variable table velocity When implemented, these methods will allow the formation of peripheral MR angiograms with optimized, patient-specific table motion, maximum efficiency, and high spatial resolution. Specific aims are: 1. Construction of the Next Generation Real-Time Image MR Reconstruction System.

"Automated Plaque Detection and Classification using MRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Acute thrombus formation on disrupted/eroded human atherosclerotic lesions plays a critical role on the onset of acute coronary syndromes and progression of atherosclerosis. Pathological evidence has clearly established that it is plaque composition rather than stenotic severity that modulates plaque vulnerability and thrombogenicity. Therefore, the possibility of detecting and characterizing atherosclerotic lesions would have significant clinical implications. Among the different imaging modalities, MRI seems to be the most promising in terms of discrimination and due to its non-invasive nature. We propose to develop an automated MRI image analysis system for detecting, measuring, and classifying atherosclerotic plaques. The proposed project will be conducted by a highly experienced team of experts in signal processing, pattern recognition, statistics, and product development in close collaboration with key cardiovascular researchers, with specific expertise in MRI imaging and atherosclerosis. Automation would establish a fast, objective (observer-independent), and standard diagnostic measure of plaque burden, allowing for comparison of results between laboratories, throughout longitudinal studies, and across different imaging equipment.

"Reconstruction Hardware for Real-Time Moving Table MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall goal of this project is to design and integrate instrumentation allowing the next generation of real-time image formation in MRI. The motivation comes from an existing project for forming MR images during continuous motion of the patient table. When applied to peripheral MR angiography the target is the formation of a moving table angiogram in which the table motion is precisely matched to the transit of the contrast bolus through the patient. However, implementation of this requires that a number of mathematical processes be done at high speed, including: (i) time-resolved 3D MRI of an extended field of view (FOV); (ii) determination of localized time-dependent parameters such as bolus arrival time and bolus velocity; (iii) variable ordering of phase encodings over the course of an MRI scan, allowing optimized local resolution; (iv) gradient warping correction for MR acquisition done using a moving patient table; (v) multi-coil reconstruction using the SENSE technique, allowing improved lateral resolution for a given acquisition time; (vi) MR acquisition done using a variable table velocity When implemented, these methods will allow the formation of peripheral MR angiograms with optimized, patient-specific table motion, maximum efficiency, and high spatial resolution. Specific aims are: 1. Construction of the Next Generation Real-Time Image MR Reconstruction System. The funding will allow the construction of a system enabling the real-time performance of the mathematical algorithms which perform the above processes.

"Reliable and Robust ECG Gating Signal for MR Imaging The focus of this project is to develop and evaluate a noel and reliable system for ECG triggering during cardiac MR imaging. Understanding the mechanism of heart failure and cardiomyopathy using MRI requires reliable and robust ECG gating (or triggering). To provide effective ECG gating, the first specific aim of this Phase I project is to design and develop an ECG lead system and concomitant signal processing methodology to allow for improved ECG detection with the magnetic. Our preliminary data describing our optimal vector signal set approach , coupled with a dual derivative ECG detections scheme, appear to be effective in reliably detecting the ECG during MR imaging. An improved ECG trigger will provide cardiac MRI imaging without the artifacts of cardiac and respiratory motion. Our second specific aim is to design and develop a wireless (telemetry) infrared (IR) system for ECG trigger transmission to eliminate the need for either wiring or a fiber optic cable during MRI examinations. Additionally preliminary data demonstrates the capability of our IR telemetry system to transmit the ECG in laboratory tests. Our optimal telemetry system will also mitigate against many of the artifacts involved in the development of an effective MRI ECG trigger. During Phase I we will demonstrate the feasibility of our system by evaluating system performance in 20 human subjects undergoing cardiac MR imaging. We believe our approach should provide a reliable and robust ECG gated trigger with minimal delay from the onset of the R-wave. Such a trigger would minimize blurring artifacts from cardiac and respiratory motion and improve MR tagging studies. Should our phase I project be successful, we would develop a real-time implementation of the entire system in an expanded Phase II biomedical engineering and extended clinical study. A successful Phase I and II project would likely receive commercial backing from a major MRI instrument manufacturer.

"METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF TAGGED MR CARDIAC IMAGES DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract):  The aim of this proposal       is to further develop and validate algorithms for analysis of SPAMM MR           cardiac images based on novel spline methods.  MRI is unique in its ability      to non-invasively and selectively alter tissue magnetization, and create         tagged patterns within the deforming tissue such as the heart muscle.  The       resulting pattern defines a time-varying curvilinear coordinate system on        the underlying tissue, allowing for precise and quantitative measurement of      tissue motion and deformation.  The investigators are developing two             frameworks for analysis of SPAMM tagged images, both of these aimed at           providing a more automated and reproducible approach to analysis of SPAMM        data, as well as providing dense 3-D displacement information at all points      within the LV myocardium.

"A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies ABSTRACT More people die every year from kidney disease than breast or prostate cancer. Kidney transplantation is life-saving, yet the donor organ shortage and high organ discard rate contributes to 13 deaths daily among patients awaiting transplant. The decision to use or discard a donor kidney relies heavily on microscopic quantitation of chronic damage by pathologists. The current standard of care relies on a manual process that is subject to significant human variability and inefficiency, resulting in potentially healthy kidneys being discarded and potentially damaged kidneys being transplanted inappropriately. Our team developed the first Deep Learning model to quantify percent global glomerulosclerosis in donor kidney frozen section biopsy whole slide images. We developed a cloud-based platform to apply the Deep Learning model to analyze kidney biopsy whole slide images in under 6 minutes with accuracy and precision equal to or greater than current standard of care pathologists. We have also developed a Deep Learning model to quantify interstitial fibrosis on donor kidney biopsy whole slide images. This innovative approach has the potential to transform donor kidney biopsy evaluation by improving pathologist efficiency, accuracy, and precision ultimately resulting in optimized donor organ utilization, improved patient outcomes, and diminished health care costs. The goal of this project is to establish our Deep Learning automated techniques as the standard for evaluating donor kidneys prior to transplantation. This will be achieved by assembling a team of expert pathologists and computer scientists specializing in machine learning. The proposal will evaluate the accuracy and precision of the interstitial fibrosis Deep Learning model, use the automated quantitation of key microscopic findings to develop an outcome-based chronic damage score that predicts graft outcome, and test the ability of the Deep Learning models to withstand variations encountered using different scanners and processing in different laboratories. The functionality of the Trusted Kidney software platform will be improved beyond the current usable product into a commercially viable solution for multiple laboratories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Before kidneys can be transplanted, they must be examined using a microscope to ensure the kidney is healthy enough for transplant. A limitation of microscopic examination by pathologists is the inherent human variability in quantifying the amount of scar tissue, or chronic damage, present. The result is potentially healthy organs being discarded or damaged kidneys being used inappropriately. This funding will support developing artificial intelligence tools to assist pathologists with quantifying scar tissue in donor kidneys prior to transplantation, resulting in more consistent and objective biopsy evaluations, minimizing discard of potentially healthy kidneys, and optimizing placement of kidneys for transplant.",A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies,10138826,R42DK120253,"['Adoption', 'Americas', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Canada', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Fibrosis', 'Frozen Sections', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Graft Survival', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Midwestern United States', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Organ Donor', 'Organ Procurements', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Personnel', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Slide', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transplantation', 'Trichrome stain', 'Trichrome stain method', 'Trust', 'United Network for Organ Sharing', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'functional improvement', 'glomerulosclerosis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'pathology imaging', 'phase 1 study', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'renal damage', 'shared database', 'standard of care', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NIDDK,"NEWVENTUREIQ, LLC",R42,2020,811695,0.0507982039201902
"Low- and Zero-dose Contrast-enhanced MRI Using Deep Learning Project Summary Motivation: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are used in approximately a third of all MRI scans. The unique relaxation parameters of GBCAs create indispensable image contrast for a wide range of clinical applications, such as angiography and tumor detection. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF can be painful, cause severe disability, and even death. The risk of developing NSF prevents millions of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams. The recent identification of gadolinium deposition within the brain and body has raised additional safety concerns about the usage of GBCAs. Studies have demonstrated increased signal intensity on the unenhanced T1-weighted MR images that is correlated with previous GBCA exposure, and this gadolinium retention is independent of renal function. While initial reports focused on linear GBCAs, more recent reports show that gadolinium deposition occurs with macrocyclic GBCAs as well, albeit at lower levels. FDA has recently issued warnings about gadolinium retention following contrast-enhanced MRI, and required GBCA manufacturers to conduct human and animal studies to further assess the safety of these contrast agents. This project addresses these concerns by developing low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI using artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL). Approach: This fast-track project has two phases and three aims. Aim 1 (Phase I) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using pre-contrast images and contrast-enhanced images acquired with only 10% of standard GBCA dose. A software infrastructure will be constructed to seamlessly integrate the DL software between MR scanners and PACS. Aim 2 (Phase II) is to develop a DL method that can synthesize full-dose contrast-enhanced MR images using GBCA-free acquisitions with different image contrast. In Aim 3 (Phase II), we will clinically validate and evaluate both low-dose and zero-dose DL methods, including on patients with mild- to-moderate CKD. Non-inferiority tests and diagnostic performance of the synthesized full-dose images compared to the true full-dose images will be performed. Significance: This work will lead to safer contrast-enhanced MRI. The low-dose and zero-dose contrast-enhanced MRI method will benefit not only millions of patients with advanced CKD, who cannot currently undergo contrast-enhanced MRI, but many more patients with normal kidney function, who are at the risk of gadolinium retention after contrast-enhanced MRI. Project Narrative Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in MRI exams to create indispensable image contrast for monitoring treatment and investigating pathology and function. However, the usage of GBCAs has been linked to the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, preventing patients with advanced chronic kidney disease from receiving contrast-enhanced MRI exams, as well as potential gadolinium deposition in the body and brain for patients with normal kidney function.

"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position.

"Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by  Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging can provide safe, non-invasive, and whole-brain measurements for large clinical and research studies of brain disorders. However, many disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alterations, which are often difficult to tease out due to limited image quality afforded by the popular 3T MRI scanners (with 20,000+ units available worldwide). Although 7T MRI scanners provide better image quality, these ultrahigh field scanners are not widely available (with only 40+ units available worldwide) and are also not used clinically. Thus, tools for reconstructing 7T-like high-quality MRI from 3T MRI scan are highly desirable. A means for achieving this is by learning the relationship between 3T and 7T MRI scans from training samples. This renewal project is dedicated to developing a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels of 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD. Specifically, (Aim 1) to enhance the image quality of 3T MRI, we will develop a novel deep learning architecture to learn a complex multi-layer 3T-to-7T mapping from training subjects, each with coupled 3T and 7T MRI scans. This mapping will then be applied to reconstruct quality-enhanced 7T-like MRI scans from new 3T MRI scans. (Aim 2) For brain structural measurement (e.g., brain atrophies, and hippocampal volume shrinkage), a crucial step is brain tissue segmentation. We will thus develop a robust and accurate random forest tissue segmentation method, which maps 7T label information to 3T scans. The mapping function is trained using tissue labels generated for 7T scans, instead of 3T scans which often have limited image contrast. (Aim 3) To further quantify local atrophies in ROIs or even sub-ROIs (i.e., hippocampal subfields), we will develop a deformable multi-ROI segmentation method by employing (a) random forest to predict deformation from each image location to the target boundary by adaptive integration of multimodal (anatomical, structural & functional connectivity) information and (b) auto-context model to iteratively refine ROI segmentation results. Note that the adaptive integration of multimodal MRI data, especially resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), is critical to the segmentation of sub-ROIs such as hippocampal subfields, since local functional connectivity patterns can help distinguish boundaries between neighboring subfields that often have different cortico-cortical connections. (Aim 4) Finally, by integrating anatomical features from all accurately segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs and also structural & functional connectivity features between those segmented ROIs/sub-ROIs, we can more effectively detect early-stage brain disorders, i.e., the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD. We will integrate information from different imaging datasets and multiple imaging centers by using our novel multi-task learning approach for jointly learning the respective disease prediction models. Applications. These computational methods will find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormalities associated with various neurological diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia), measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between imaging and clinical scores. Narrative Description of Project The goal of this renewal project is to achieve robust brain measurements from the routine 3T MRI, guided by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI. To this end, we will create a set of novel learning-based methods to transfer image contrast and tissue/anatomical labels from 7T MRI of training subjects to 3T MRI of new testing subjects for 1) image quality enhancement, 2) high-precision tissue segmentation, 3) accurate anatomical ROI (region of interest) labeling, and eventually 4) early detection of brain disorders such as AD.",Development of Robust Brain Measurement Tools Informed by Ultrahigh Field 7T MRI,9977173,R01EB006733,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atrophic', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multi-task learning', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'research study', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,438169,0.012476358923992702
"Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement ABSTRACT This proposal aims to develop deep learning methods to automate the extraction of morphological imaging features relevant to knee osteoarthritis (OA), and total knee replacement. While, quantitative evaluation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a central role in OA research in the clinical setting MR reports often tend to be subjective, qualitative, and the grading schemes utilized in epidemiological research are not used because they are extraordinarily time consuming and do not lend themselves to the demands of todays changing healthcare scenario. The “Big Data” challenge and opportunity facing us makes it necessary to build enabling tools (i) to automate the extraction of morphological OA imaging features, with the aim of evaluating disease progression prediction capabilities on larger sample sizes that have never been explored before; (ii) to discover latent patterns by uncovering unexplored data-driven imaging features by the application of state of the art deep learning approaches (1); (iii) combine multi-modality imaging with clinical, functional, activity, and other data to define the trajectory of joint degeneration in OA. Leveraging the power of these state of the art techniques, and with the extraordinary availability of a large datasets of annotated images; in this project, we propose to develop an automatic post-processing pipeline able to segment musculoskeletal tissues and identify morphological OA features in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), as defined by commonly used MRI grading systems. Automation of morphological grading of the tissues in the joint would be a significant breakthrough in both OA research and clinical practice. It would enable the analysis of large sample sizes, assist the radiologist/clinician in the grading of images, take a relatively short amount of time, reduce cost, and could potentially, improve classification models. The availability of automatic pipelines for the identification of morphological abnormities in MRI would drastically change clinical practice, and include semi-quantitative grades, rather than subjective impressions in radiology clinical reports. In this study, we also aim to develop a complete supervised deep learning approach to obtain data-driven representations as non-linear and semantic aggregation among elementary features able to exploit the latent information hidden in the complexity of a 3D MR images, eliminating the need for nominal grades of selected features. This second aim, while being at high risk has also a potential exceptional high impact; as it departs from the classical hypothesis driven studies, and builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize morphological grading of MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a more quantitative feature driven basis for routine radiological clinical reports. The clinical impact of this proposal lies in the third aim (R33 phase), in which we propose to translate the solutions developed in the R61 phase on images in the UCSF clinical archives (PACS), and plan to include also demographic and clinical data in the electronic health records, to build the models defining total knee replacements. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deep learning is revolutionizing medical imaging by solving challenging problems in disease classification, progression and therapeutic response. In this project, we focus on using deep learning methodology on magnetic resonance images of the knee to study osteoarthritis prevalence, and progression. The usage of features derived from the imaging data, rather than established, and often subjective grading schemes, will have significant impact on clinical radiology, establishing quantitative physician assist tools with an ultimate goal of reducing the economic and healthcare burden of total knee replacement.",Deep Learning for Characterizing Knee Joint Degeneration Predicting Progression of Osteoarthritis and Total Knee Replacement,10193990,R33AR073552,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cartilage', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Models', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economics', 'Edema', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Imaging', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scheme', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Subchondral Cyst', 'Supervision', 'Synovitis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'automated segmentation', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disease classification', 'drug discovery', 'epidemiology study', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'joint destruction', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'novel', 'parallel processing', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R33,2020,403748,0.011484867821556341
"Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy Project Summary/Abstract Diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy (LR) currently relies on a qualitative interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and lacks standardization. This has led to inconsistent treatment and rising costs, while quality of life metrics have remained stagnant. To standardize the diagnosis of LR, the subjective and qualitative radiologic assessment needs to be augmented with accurate measurements of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas, two anatomical structures that are critical to the etiology of LR. However, precise measurements will require manual delineations of these regions on MRI. This is a tedious and time-consuming process that is not feasible on a daily, large-scale basis in the clinic. Deep Learning (DL) is a relatively new machine learning technique, which holds the promise of automating NF and CC segmentation. None the less, there remain several challenges to making DL-based segmentation routine in clinical practice. First, training and validating a DL model for segmentation of a given anatomical structure requires a large amount of expert annotated training data. Expert annotated data is expensive and time consuming to obtain, thus thwarting the development of quantitative imaging diagnostics for LR. To address this, we propose an expert-led manual delineation of NF and CC using de-identified MRI data extracted from UCLA's picture archiving and communications system (PACS). We expect the resulting database to contain data from over 35,000 lumbar MRI scans, with associated clinical history, demographics, and patient outcomes data. In a subset (1000) of these data, NFs and CCs will be annotated by multiple human expert raters. The consensus of these delineations will be used as ground truth segmentations to train, validate and improve our understanding of DL models. Secondly, as a part of this proposal, we aim to address several technical challenges that limit the deployment of automated image segmentation techniques to the clinic. Chief amongst these challenges is the failure of automated methodologies in the face of variation due to factors such as pathology, scanner protocol alterations, and general demographic variation. Additionally, our current understanding of DL does not allow us to categorically state the total number of expert annotated data that will be needed to train a model with a specified level of accuracy. Finally, we do not currently understand how selection of training cases for expert delineation affects generalization accuracy. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose experiments to define the relationship between DL algorithms and the cardinality of training data. We will also explore the use of unsupervised machine learning strategies, namely clustering and reinforcement learning, to understand how training data selection influences algorithmic accuracy. In summary, we propose to address data availability and technical knowledge gaps to the development of accurate DL-based techniques for automated NF and CC delineation, with a broader view to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of LR. Project Narrative Basing radiological diagnoses on a quantitative characterization of neuroforamina (NF) and central canal (CC) areas would greatly improve the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar radiculopathy (LR). Manual measurement of this anatomy on every clinical study is not feasible; however, deep learning- (DL) based automated methods can reliable perform this task if 1) expert annotations to train DL algorithms are available and 2) we can train DL models to work accurately despite image heterogeneity. We address these knowledge gaps by developing 1) a database containing spine MR images with expert annotation of NFs and CCs and 2) intelligent training data selection frameworks to train DL algorithms and assess their robustness to heterogeneity.",Developing Database and Software infrastructure for Quantitative Radiologic Analysis of Lumbar Radiculopathy,9928429,R21EB026665,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Central cord canal structure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Intelligence', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural History', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiculopathy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Diseases', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'demographics', 'experimental study', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'segmentation algorithm', 'software infrastructure', 'theories', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment optimization', 'unsupervised learning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2020,195000,0.005218344497811177
"Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation ABSTRACT  Although the cardiac ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation has a wide adoption rate, it also has a high recurrence of arrhythmia primarily due to the creation of suboptimal lesions. The procedure is also associated with complications including cardiac perforation, tamponade, atrio-esophageal fistulas and thrombus. Repeated and prolonged X-ray exposure for the clinician can also lead to enhanced risk of cancer. A fluoroless approach using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is becoming a more widely adopted imaging option due to the absence of ionizing radiation and the possibility of real-time monitoring of the created lesions. However, the ICE- guided approach suffers from significant shortcomings, which include poor dexterity of the ICE catheter, difficulty in simultaneously manipulating the ICE and ablation catheters, unintuitive image orientation and noisy image quality. There is therefore an unmet need to overcome these shortcomings of the ICE-guided approach to enable better lesion creation and reduced complications associated with the cardiac ablation procedure. The long-term goal of this research is to develop robotic technologies, control and machine learning algorithms to enable ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. The objective is to develop a novel robotic manipulator, a steerable ICE catheter, and machine learning and control algorithms to manipulate the ICE catheter and monitor the created lesions in real-time. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that the robot-assisted steerable ICE catheter with the catheter tracking algorithms will enable simultaneous manipulation of the ICE and ablation catheters. Further, the machine learning algorithms to monitor therapy will reduce the risk of complications, while ensuring the creation of necrotic lesions, thereby reducing the recurrence of AF. In this proposal, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design, develop, and model a steerable 3D ICE catheter with enhanced dexterity. 2) Design and develop a robotic manipulator and associated control algorithms to allow for precise manipulation of the ICE catheter. 3) Develop machine-learning and vision-based algorithms integrated with a navigation system for tracking the ablation catheter, and monitoring therapy. 4) Validate the robotic ICE system in heart phantom and porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation. The proposed research is innovative in that it builds on state-of-the-art robotics technology, machine learning and vision algorithms to enable fluoroless ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study addresses an important and under-investigated area of treating atrial fibrillation using a completely fluoroless approach with ICE imaging.

"Artificial Intelligence to Predict Outcomes in Patients with Acute Kidney Injury on Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects up to half of critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU). In patients with AKI and hemodynamic instability, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the preferred dialysis modality for solute and volume control. ICU mortality in this vulnerable population is high (~75%) but kidney recovery occurs in up to two-thirds of survivors. Fluid overload is a potentially modifiable risk factor associated with these outcomes. However, there are currently no universally accepted approaches for predicting kidney recovery, survival or individual response to fluid removal during CRRT. Due to recent advances in computer science and widespread big data usage, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a valuable approach. DL allows construction of risk prediction models using time-series data that incorporate thousands of variables and dynamic changes in these variables derived from multi-dimensional sources and not only static values of these variables. We propose to develop and validate innovative DL approaches to dynamically predict these outcomes using multi-modal data from electronic health records and CRRT machines. We demonstrated superiority of DL models without a-priori variable selection compared to optimized logistic regression (C-Statistic of 0.72 vs. 0.62) for prediction of RRT liberation. We also showed that mortality prediction improved by incorporating changes in clinical data within 6-hour intervals after CRRT initiation. In addition, we identified distinctive mortality risk according to quintiles of achieved net ultrafiltration rates, after adjustment by patient’s weight, duration of CRRT, and other clinical parameters: OR 8.0 (95% CI: 2.7-25.1) when the highest quintile (>36 ml/kg/day) was compared to the lowest quintile (<13 ml/kg/day). We hypothesize that innovative DL approaches integrating time- series data will generate accurate and generalizable risk prediction models that can impact CRRT delivery. We will utilize a multi-institutional dataset that encompasses clinical data and CRRT programmatic and therapy data (CRRTnet registry, n=1500 patients) for model development and an independent multi-institutional dataset for validation (n=1500 patients) to: 1) continuously predict short-term (7-day) and medium-term (28-day) liberation from RRT due to kidney recovery; 2) continuously predict 24-hour mortality; and 3) identify and validate sub- phenotypes of patients with AKI on CRRT with differing achieved net ultrafiltration rates. This innovative research will assist 1) the development of novel clinical decision support platforms for guiding informed CRRT delivery and promoting kidney recovery; 2) the identification of sub-phenotypes of patients that can benefit from precision- medicine approaches to fluid removal during CRRT; and 3) the design of interventional studies focusing on fluid removal during CRRT to impact patient-centered outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the preferred dialysis treatment for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and hemodynamic instability, yet mortality is high (~75%). Presently, there are no universally accepted approaches for predicting kidney recovery, survival or individual response to fluid removal during CRRT.

"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",9886248,R01EB028146,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Fibrosis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Iron', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'body system', 'deep learning', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'magnetic field', 'magnetohydrodynamic', 'mathematical model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'time use', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,628575,0.04014228929166072
"MRI and Deep Learning for Early Prediction of Neurodevelopmental Deficits in Very Preterm Infants Project Summary/Abstract About 100,000 very preterm infants (VPI; ≤32 weeks gestational age) are born every year in the United States. Up to 35% develop noteworthy neurodevelopmental deficits, thereby increasing their risk for poor educational, health, and social outcomes. Unfortunately, neurodevelopmental deficits cannot currently be reliably diagnosed until 3 to 5 years of age. The imminent challenge lies in early identification of infants that are more likely to develop later deficits. Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and deep learning (DL) provide means to address this challenge. Application of DL to infant brain MRI data can open up new windows into early prediction of neurodevelopmental outcomes in at-risk infants and facilitate the move towards precision medicine. Our objective is to apply DL to MRI acquired at term equivalent age for early prediction of neurodevelopment deficits (cognitive, language, and motor) at age 2 in VPI. Our group has identified three key components necessary for accurate prognostic models of later neurodevelopment. DL analysis of 1) anatomical features derived from structural MRI (sMRI) allowing detection of brain structural abnormalities and tissue pathologies; 2) brain connectivity features derived from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) giving insights into atypical brain connectivity patterns; and 3) integration of anatomical and connectivity features, thus enhancing abnormal neurodevelopment prediction. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts in accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1 and Aim 2, we will develop deepAna and deepConn models analyzing anatomical and connectivity features independently to predict adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. By decoding each model, we will identify, validate and disseminate a series of the most discriminative anatomical and connectivity features to the research community. In Aim 3, we will develop an ensemble deepAnaConn model analyzing both anatomical and connectivity features, together with clinical risk factors, for early prediction of neurodevelopmental deficits. This model will help clinicians to predict later outcomes for those at-risk prematurely born infants before initial neonatal intensive care unit discharge. We will validate the models using both internal and independent external data and will open the ‘black-box’ of DL to aid interpretation of imaging and clinical findings. The techniques we develop are expected to improve the modelling fidelity in medical diagnosis/ prognosis in the same way as DL has revolutionized other fields. The DL models we develop will not only benefit early detection of neurodevelopmental deficits in VPI, but also likely benefit individuals with other neurodevelopmental and neurological diseases. This study will significantly impact public health because it will allow clinicians to target clinical and experimental intervention therapies to the most at-risk infants during periods of optimal neuroplasticity, and thus ultimately improve medical outcomes and patient well-being. Project Narrative Babies born at younger than 32 weeks’ gestation (~100,000 per year in the US) are at high risk for neurodevelopmental problems that can have a lifelong impact on quality of life. Early, targeted intervention while the brain is still malleable is the key, but accurately predicting which children will develop which problems, has not yet been successful. Herein, we propose to use artificial intelligence/deep learning, which works by feeding a computer program with existing imaging, clinical and outcome data, and then generating a template by which clinicians can compare new imaging and clinical data to accurately predict outcomes, thus allowing early, aggressive intervention where appropriate.",MRI and Deep Learning for Early Prediction of Neurodevelopmental Deficits in Very Preterm Infants,10028428,R01EB029944,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Welfare', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Problem', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Series', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computer program', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'neonate', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'risk prediction model', 'social', 'success']",NIBIB,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2020,297504,-0.010357965365358516
"Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI Summary/Abstract In the presence of diseases such as ischemic heart disease (IHD), cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. However, while imaging methods such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can provide high quality images of the moving heart, conventional clinical quantitative analysis of cardiac function is largely limited to global function analysis of the left ventricle (LV), with only qualitative and subjective characterization of regional function. An obstacle to better quantification of regional function is the complex 3D structure and motion of the heart wall, which has typically necessitated time-consuming user-guided processing of the images to carry out the associated 3D-motion analysis.  Recent advances in machine-learning (ML) approaches for image analysis are promising as new means to speed up the processing of cardiac images, as well as to analyze the underlying regional motion patterns. However, current Deep ML (DML) approaches to image analysis largely function as “black boxes”, without clear indications of which features contribute most to the analysis results, thus limiting their clinical utility. In the initial funded period of this research project, we have been developing integrated approaches to the segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and analysis of CMR data, with application to the evaluation of cardiac dyssynchrony. Today, treatment of dyssynchrony in HF with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) leads to improvement in only ~2/3 patients selected with conventional criteria (usually by electrocardiogram [ECG]). Our initial results show encouraging results of correlation between MRI evaluation of dyssynchrony and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) outcomes. In the new proposed research, we will further develop these methods, with the goal of automating the cardiac analysis methods. This will include the introduction of new ML-based methods, which will incorporate information on the specific cardiac motion factors that lead to classification of different disease states in dyssynchrony. Our Hypothesis is that by using these new ML-based methods for cardiac motion analysis, we will discover and evaluate significant quantitative correlations between different cardiac dyssynchrony motion patterns and CRT outcomes. Also, late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) provides images for infarction visualization. Incorporation of tissue characterization into the motion-pattern analysis could lead to increased understanding of how infarcted areas affect regional motion in concert with dyssynchrony. The unearthing of these findings will allow us to validate them in future clinical studies. The project will also disseminate our novel, coupled DML and model-based methodology for quantifying and classifying cardiac motion in diseases affecting regional wall motion. Other research groups can then apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases affecting LV motion. Project Narrative A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), as the current clinical selection criteria do not take into account regional cardiac function. We will develop improved methods for 4D-analysis and -visualization of both global and regional cardiac function from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data, including novel deep learning methods that will provide additional information on the salient features that contribute most to characterization of cardiac dyssynchrony. These new methods will be applied to the analysis of CMR data from both a stratified sample of normal subjects and patients with cardiac dyssynchrony (with and without infarction), with correlation with therapeutic results following CRT, potentially leading to improved clinical guidelines and clinical outcomes, as well as increased understanding of cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.",Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI,10052934,R01HL127661,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pump', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Selection Criteria', 'Speed', 'Sweden', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visualization', 'Width', 'base', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2020,763531,0.042954272227169354
"Non-invasive Evaluation of Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease Using Hemodynamic Biomarkers The proposed study will be based on a multimodal approach using 4D flow MRI, perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI), diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and high-resolution vessel wall imaging (VWI) together with patient information (demographics and clinical factors) to predict the risk of recurrent stroke of patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) stenosis. This will allow integrating the vulnerability of the stenosis as well as the patient by assessing the hemodynamic impact, plaque stability, and stroke lesion pattern together with patient information into a prediction model. PWI will provide tissue perfusion, VWI will provide plaque stability, DWI will provide stroke lesion pattern and 4D flow MRI will provide macroscopic hemodynamics of the circle of Willis (CoW). We will concentrate on the following innovative developments: 4D flow MRI: In order to allow 4D flow MRI scanning with a high dynamic velocity range (necessary to measure slow and fast velocities simultaneously), we recently developed dual-venc 4D flow MRI. However, this method suffers from extended scan tome of an already long acquisition. We, therefore, aim to minimize scan time for dual-venc 4D flow MRI scan while using the required spatial resolution and volume coverage, targeting 5-10 minutes so that this sequence can be added to clinical protocols. We aim to achieve this by integrating compressed sensing acceleration. Rigorous testing of the sequence will be done in phantom experiments as well as in a healthy test-retest control study. Data Analysis and Outcome Prediction: Currently, the multi-modal information that can be acquired with MRI has not been combined and used for comprehensive prediction of recurrent stroke risk in ICAD. Information that can be acquired from different MRI modalities may be critical in characterizing ICAD patient status. We will develop a new analysis tool that combines all data into a single network graph. All imaging data will be reported relative to supplying the intracranial artery of the CoW by using the vascular territory region of interest analysis. This will allow gathering all imaging parameters in a network graph. In a cross-sectional patient study, we will use combined data to see if it enables differentiation between healthy subjects, ICAD subgroups. Patient Study: In Aim 3, we will develop a machine-learning algorithm to predict which of the patients are at risk of experiencing a recurrent stroke. In order to achieve this, we will enroll a total of 150 ICAD patients from two institutions (Northwestern Memorial Hospital and San Francisco General Hospital). The combined data from the four different MR modalities and all other patient information will be used to identify only the discriminative features. This will be realized by using support vector machine recursive feature elimination to rank features associated with the risk of an ischemic event. The SVM will be trained and tested using information from the patient's clinical follow-up as outcome measure. The outcome (ischemic event or death yes/no)) will enable the development of the SVM classifier to predict outcome. Project Narrative (2 – 3 sentences) In the proposed study, we will develop an advanced intracranial MRI protocol together with a comprehensive image processing pipeline allowing full characterization of intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD). Imaging biomarkers together with clinical and demographic factors will enable the identification of patients at risk to suffer recurring stroke. Machine learning methods will be used to predict risk. Successful completion will allow for better identification of patients who could benefit from endovascular stenting to reduce stroke recurrence.",Non-invasive Evaluation of Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease Using Hemodynamic Biomarkers,10052508,R01HL149787,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Angioplasty', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Infarction', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Circle of Willis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Control Groups', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Coupled', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Death Rate', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drops', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Flowmeters', 'Gender', 'General Hospitals', 'Graph', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Arterial Stenosis', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Perfusion Weighted MRI', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'San Francisco', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Stenosis', 'Stents', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'cerebrovascular', 'comorbidity', 'demographics', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'hypoperfusion', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'intracranial artery', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'pressure sensor', 'prognostic significance', 'stroke patient', 'stroke risk', 'supervised learning', 'support vector machine', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,486172,-0.05907418453372546
"Artificial intelligence-enabled, real-time communication software for optimizing clinical decision making during the allocation, procurement, and transplantation of donated organs Project Abstract for HealthTech Solutions Kidney transplantation is a clinically effective and cost-effective treatment for patients suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and diabetes. Twenty-two patients die each day waiting for a transplant and 30% of all deaths in the US could be prevented by organ transplant. Despite the obvious clinical and cost-effective advantages of kidney transplantation, there has been a decades-long rise in the kidney discard rate from 5.1% in 1988 to 19.2% in 2015. During a successful Phase I grant and to address the need for a dedicated communications system to help improve transplant patient outcomes and achieve greater donated organ utilization, HealthTech Solutions (HTS), Inc. developed a proprietary mobile application for secure team communication tailored specifically for kidney transplant teams. To further improve communication efficiency and augment critical decision making in healthcare, specifically for surgeons, HTS will employ machine learning (ML) powered clinical decision support. Clinical decision support (CDS) may significantly increase access, increase quality, and reduce the cost of kidney transplantation. The proposed project is designed to further test and quantify the improvement of the donor management, coordination process, and kidney utilization outcomes using the company’s CDS and communication infrastructure for medical team communication. The aims are; 1) Develop CDS models specifically for transplant professionals aimed at improving decision times and decision confidence. Develop the CDS infrastructure capable of handling medical data and serving insights safely, securely, and rapidly; 2) Asses usability by working with a test group to exceed usability criteria and ensure that CDS meets clinician needs through user feedback iterations. Verification of utility from a diversified testing group (n=10) that represent every type of professional involved in transplant cases. 3) Measure the effects of TXP Chat enhanced with CDS after live clinical implementation in the kidney offer and procurement processes for more than 3,000 offers (1,500 with CDS and 1,500 control) over a period of 365 days with multiple partner institutions (n=3). TXP Chat and CDS will demonstrate to be reliable, secure, trustworthy and useful by the clinical/technical community, increase kidney acceptance practices resulting in an increase in kidney transplants, reduction in cold ischemic time, and reduction in time from offer to transplant. Ultimately, these metrics have been demonstrated in the literature to improve patient outcomes, reduce expensive chronic treatment costs (e.g. dialysis), reduce patient deaths from lack of kidney availability, and significantly improve human health and productivity. Study results will be disseminated via publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Aim 1 will lay the foundation for further development to enable wider CDS in the Phase IIB. Aim 2 will prove physician support and steady adoption trend as we roll into commercialization. Aim 3 will provide multi-center pilot study data used to prove increased efficiency of the process in terms of time, money, and total number of kidneys transplanted. Project Narrative Despite the obvious clinical and cost-effectiveness advantages of kidney transplantation for many patients, nearly 1 in 5 kidneys authorized for donation are discarded. This project addresses the need for an efficient communications software technology enhanced with clinical decision support tailored for organ procurement organizations and transplant centers. Combined with enhanced communication efficiency, clinical decision support powered by machine learning may significantly improve donated kidney utilization and increase the number of viable, but currently unused organs that could otherwise be successfully transplanted, reducing waste and saving lives.","Artificial intelligence-enabled, real-time communication software for optimizing clinical decision making during the allocation, procurement, and transplantation of donated organs",10017295,R44LM012575,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asses', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Direct Costs', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Journals', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Multiple Partners', 'Organ', 'Organ Procurements', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Renal Glycosuria', 'Reporting', 'Savings', 'Secure', 'Surgeon', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Cost', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'burnout', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical implementation', 'cohesion', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'mobile application', 'operation', 'prevent', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'transmission process', 'transplant centers', 'trend', 'usability', 'wasting']",NLM,ORGANIZER,R44,2020,975104,0.035446974322519545
"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9923450,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'kidney dysfunction', 'machine learning method', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'predictive test', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'random forest', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,334508,0.045280414968393426
"A new approach to predict graft outcome from histology in children undergoing kidney transplantation using machine learning methods Abstract Although the overall renal graft survival has dramatically improved over the last several decades, almost half of pediatric patients lose their transplant within 10 years. Epidemiology, immunology and histology are all key elements in understanding post-transplant complications and in predicting clinical outcomes, however accurate prediction of transplant outcomes remains challenging and understudied among pediatric kidney transplant recipients. Machine learning technology is rapidly advancing and has demonstrated remarkable predictive accuracy surpassing classical predictive models in several biomedical applications. The goal of this research proposal is to develop machine learning methods to improve prediction of transplant outcomes through analysis of histology, assemble data sufficient to describe the incidence of different types of rejection and histological findings on pediatric kidney transplant biopsies, and to assess their impact on graft outcome. To achieve these goals, we will assemble an international multicenter cohort of over 700 pediatric kidney transplant recipients and develop and validate machine-learning models combining clinical, immunological and histological data for predicting short-term pediatric graft outcomes. This study will enable accurate, reproducible, and standardized assessment of histopathological findings in pediatric transplant recipients and provide a new method to predict graft outcome. This will pave the way to future large, prospective study assessing the feasibility and potential impact of machine-learning methods in transplant biopsy analysis, with the goal of improving clinical management and resource utilization by identifying patients with high risk of graft loss. Finally, this study will provide critical information for efficient and effective design of clinical trials focused on improving outcomes of pediatric kidney transplant recipients, with an emphasis on individualized treatment. Project Narrative: Accurate prediction of graft outcome in pediatric kidney transplant patients is critical to individualize patients' management and treatment and to design efficient and effective clinical trials focused on improving outcomes of these patients. Our long-term goal is to improve the assessment of histopathological findings in pediatric transplant recipients and create a new systematic methodology to predict graft outcomes that can be applied nationally and internationally.

"Machine learning for fast motion compensated quantitative abdominal DCE-MRI Project Summary: Functional imaging with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) provides important physiological markers of permeability, perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), a measure of kidney function, without exposing patients to ionizing radiation. DCE-MR images are at the same time used for evaluation of anatomy. Functional markers from DCE-MRI, if computed accurately, would play a critical role in diagnosing and assessing the progression of a number of pediatric diseases including those compromising kidney function, liver diseases, tumors, and Crohn's disease. One of the most important applications of DCE-MRI is assessing kidney function (GFR) in hydronephrosis patients with obstruction. In the absence of GFR information, children who stand to benefit from immediate surgical reconstruction might be overlooked or delayed in receiving treatment, and those who might benefit from a more conservative approach (i.e., “watchful waiting”) might receive an unnecessary surgical intervention. While the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3), yields some useful diagnostic information, it is slow, provides low resolution, does not offer anatomic detail, and delivers potentially harmful ionizing radiation. There is a clinical need for accurate computation of quantitative functional markers. Unfortunately, current methods of DCE-MRI in neonates and children are less than optimal, and therefore, DCE-MRI is underutilized in clinical practice. The technical challenges include insufficient temporal resolution to capture fast arterial input function (AIF) dynamics (which are required for accurate computation of quantitative markers), unavoidable respiratory motion and bulk motion (which reduce image quality and significantly lower the accuracy of parameter estimates), and a lack of robust, fast, automated post processing techniques for accurate computation of markers. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need to develop a motion-compensated, high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI method addressing these challenges. The primary objective of this exploratory, three-year study, is three-fold: first, to develop and evaluate a new bulk and respiratory motion-compensated, high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI technique for accurate estimation of functional markers; second, to further improve the robustness and speed of DCE-MRI using a fast, deep learning (DL) technique with integrated temporal prior for the reconstruction of motion-compensated, higher quality, high temporal resolution images; and third, to develop an automatic quantitative analysis pipeline including segmentation and tracer kinetic model-fitting using DL techniques for fast, robust and accurate quantification of functional markers. The successful completion of these aims will provide new, clinically important abdominal imaging capabilities, with real-time, motion-compensated image reconstruction and reliable real-time parameter estimation from high temporal and spatial resolution DCE-MRI. This work will extend the usefulness of DCE-MRI to pediatric patients who are unable to remain still in the scanner, and eliminate the need for repeated scans and sedation in infants. ! !

"Enhanced Diagnosis of Antibody-Mediated Kidney Rejection by Machine Learning and Hybrid Targeted-Shotgun Proteomics Kidney transplantation offers the best quality of life for patients with chronic kidney failure. Antibody and T-cell mediated rejection (ABMR and TCMR) are key factors that determine graft survival. Currently, the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of rejection relies on histopathologic examination which has known limitations such as subjective interpretations, limited reproducibility, and the need for expert transplant pathologists. There is an unmet need to develop more specific and quantitative molecular tests that can complement and enhance conventional histologic assessment. Among the molecular assays, proteome profiling is more attractive than genomic and transcriptomic profiling which are subjected to numerous post-translational and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Moreover, morphologic changes form the basis of classifying different allograft diseases. Therefore, the transplant community needs to invest in biopsy-based assays in addition to the blood/urine-based assays that are being developed by others. This study is aimed to fully map the proteomic changes in routinely processed formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies using a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) platform. To meet the needs of personalized medicine, this platform uses a novel strategy and machine learning to simultaneously measure the absolute expression levels of a panel of targeted biomarkers as well as thousands of untargeted proteins. The central hypothesis is that LC-MS/MS can be used to define disease-specific biomarkers using a discovery data set, which can then be followed up by a validation data set to determine if LC-MS/MS based tests can be implemented in clinical practice. In the current project, we will focus on developing molecular assays for ABMR since antibody contributes to graft loss in 60% of patients. Two Aims are proposed. In Aim #1, quantitative proteomic strategies will be used to map proteome-level changes in a discovery set of biopsies with ABMR and its mimics, such as acute tubular injury (ATI), TCMR, BK virus nephropathy (BKVN), interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), and stable renal function (STA). The goal is to identify potential protein biomarkers that can distinguish ABMR from its mimics. In Aim #2, the potential ABMR biomarkers obtained in Aim #1 will be validated and optimized in an independent validation data set. Using a hybrid proteomic platform combing targeted, shotgun proteomics and machine learning, information on absolute quantitation of potential protein biomarkers and thousands of other proteins will be collected to build a kidney transplant Protein Atlas for assay development. Successful completion of this study has great potential to be translated into clinical tests that will enhance the diagnosis of ABMR from other diseases that can mimic that pathology. It will also serve as a model for developing a new generation of clincal diagnositc tests that will use routinely fixed biopsy materials. This will eliminate the need for intense biobanking efforts, which have hampered the more widespread implementation of molecular diagnostics into the transplant clinic. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is aimed at devising more accurate and reliable tests for diagnosing rejection of transplanted kidneys. Better tests will lead to more effective treatment, prolong graft life, and improve the quality of life for patients with chronic kidney failure.",Enhanced Diagnosis of Antibody-Mediated Kidney Rejection by Machine Learning and Hybrid Targeted-Shotgun Proteomics,10055012,R21AI148776,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Atlases', 'Atrophic', 'BK Virus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Comb animal structure', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fibrosis', 'Formalin', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft Survival', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hybrids', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Quality of life', 'RNA', 'RNA analysis', 'Reaction', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shotguns', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'assay development', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'burden of illness', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'complement C4d', 'cost', 'design', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'histological specimens', 'histopathological examination', 'improved', 'interstitial', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular diagnostics', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein expression', 'proteomic signature', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'synthetic peptide', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'targeted biomarker', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2020,234008,-0.006119058249523904
"Reconstruction of robust, high SNR functional brain images using machine learning and oscillatory steady state MRI Project Summary/Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an important tool both clinically and in scientific research, with broad applications ranging from cognitive neuroscience to presurgical planning. FMRI can generate whole brain neuronal activation maps, yet it is an inherently low signal to noise ratio (SNR) method due to the relatively small changes in activation signal relative to the baseline signal. The overarching goal of this project is to develop and validate robust, high SNR fMRI by using a novel acquisition method, oscillating steady state (OSS) fMRI, along with machine learning (ML) techniques, to reconstruct high-quality images of the OSS fMRI data. OSS fMRI can increase SNR by >2x compared to the current state-of-the-art in fMRI acquisition methods, and this boost is roughly equivalent to the SNR gain going from a 3T MRI scanner to a 7T MRI scanner. The SNR increase is a direct result of the steady state approach. However, with a more complex, oscillating acquisition, OSS fMRI can be more susceptible to common MRI artifacts than traditional methods if left uncorrected. Two of the most common sources of MRI artifacts are changes in the main magnetic field (B0) due to physiological noise (such as respiration) and patient motion. This project will develop robust, high SNR fMRI at 3T by incorporating the effects of (1) B0 changes and (2) patient motion into the OSS signal model and image reconstruction algorithms. A new image reconstruction that incorporates neural networks will correct for B0 fluctuations and remove B0 induced artifacts. We will train a neural network to generate B0 field maps using data from a conventional, physics-based two echo field mapping technique to implicitly incorporate prior information of the physics into the reconstruction, while also providing a fast, ML-based field mapping method. To correct for subject motion, we will develop a neural network that estimates rigid-body motion parameters from sequential image frames in the fMRI scan. These motion parameters will be used in an iterative image reconstruction to produce high-quality resting-state and task-based fMRI, even in the presence of subject motion. The technology developed in this proposal will result in improved functional MRI that has the potential to significantly advance both the study of the human brain and the treatment of neurological disorders. The University of Michigan is one of the top research universities in the US, and provides an ideal environment and infrastructure to complete the proposed research strategy. The Functional Magnetic Resonance Laboratory and the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at UM have all the necessary hardware and computational resources needed for this project, including two state-of-the-art GE 3T MRI scanners and extensive GPU hardware for the machine learning components of the project. Furthermore, Drs. Jeffrey Fessler and Douglas Noll have proven expertise in fMRI image acquisition and reconstruction, as well as extensive mentorship experience, that will help guide this project and my training. Project Narrative Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to measure brain function, and it has revolutionized our understanding of cognitive processes during the last 25 years and has also been used as a tool for presurgical mapping of language and other sensitive brain regions. More recently, fMRI is being used as a biomarker for the progression of neurologic and psychiatric diseases, for example, in Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and major depression. In this project we will improve fMRI techniques by developing new methods that are more robust to common sources of MRI image degradation, which will improve the sharpness of the fMRI images without increasing instrumentation costs.","Reconstruction of robust, high SNR functional brain images using machine learning and oscillatory steady state MRI",10067072,F32EB029289,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dictionary', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Left', 'Length', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic Process', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'experience', 'functional MRI scan', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'instrumentation', 'magnetic field', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'progression marker', 'reconstruction', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F32,2020,64926,0.0004955009172437143
"DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation Contact PD/PI: Fereidouni, Farzad Abstract Kidneys, like other organs, have an inherent capacity to recover from acute injury; however, severe or recurrent injury can result in chronic kidney disease (CKD), the sequelae of which result in 82,000 deaths annually in the US alone. Regardless of the etiology of the initial injury, the common final pathway leading to- end stage renal disease is closely connected to fibrosis(excess or aberrant collagen distribution), one of the most important determinants of renal disease severity and prognosis. Histology is the gold standard for evaluation, typically through the use of histochemical stains such as trichrome and PAS that highlight the presence of collagens and basement membrane, respectively. Nevertheless, these stains are not completely specific, can be technically challenging to perform well and reproducibly, and thus contribute to interobserver variability and a concomitant decrease in diagnostic precision. Moreover, they also require the preparation of extra slides and additional staining procedures, and thus increase cost and can prolong the diagnostic process. We propose to optimize, deploy and test a new kind of microscope, DUET (DUal mode Emission and Transmission microscopy), developed at UC Davis, that will be a low-cost and very rapid solution for detection and digital characterization of the presence and distribution of collagen and other macromolecules, directly from standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Specifically, we will finalize the design of the hardware and software components of the instrument itself, validate imaging performance against standard histology and immunohistochemical stains for collagen and other components, and with the assistance of scientists at our partnering institutions (John Hopkins University and University of Buffalo) develop robust tools for analysis and quantitation of fibrosis. DUET instrument hardware will be shared with JHU to ensure that the methods are technically reproducible across multiple sites. The application leverages the expertise across three institutions in optics, biomedical engineering, renal pathology and novel artificial intelligence approaches. The goal of the project is development and validation of DUET, which promises to be a robust, inexpensive and practical approach for the rapid and accurate evaluation of fibrosis, extensible to other renal pathologies, and indeed across other organs systems, with significant positive impact on disease research, clinical practice, and patient outcomes. Page 6 Project Summary/Abstract Project Narrative Evaluation of fibrosis and tubular atrophy from chemically stained kidney biopsies are essential for diagnosis and disease-severity assessment, but current techniques are time-consuming, somewhat non-specific and contribute to interobserver variability and imprecision, affecting care. We propose to optimize and test a new kind of microscope (“DUET”) that can visualize fibrosis (scarring) and other tissue abnormalities directly from standard slides to enable high-quality reproducible fibrosis scoring and evaluation. This multi-site project will also provide a unique opportunity to perform a retrospective study from hundreds of existing H&E slides with associated months to years of clinical follow-up data, and to create a method with demonstrated utility in more than one institution.",DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation,10261643,R56DK124873,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Basement membrane', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Buffaloes', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrillar Collagen', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Natural History', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirius Red F3B', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Trichrome stain method', 'Tubular formation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'follow-up', 'histological stains', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney fibrosis', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'software development', 'stem', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R56,2020,91725,0.003812639147833336
"Multi-modal and Extreme PET/MRI Reconstruction Methods Project Summary / Abstract  Hybrid PET/MRI systems are very advantageous for a variety of clinical applications by combining the soft tissue contrast of MRI with the functional and metabolic information of PET. These systems have found success for oncology studies, particularly in head and abdomen/pelvis, as well as for epilepsy, neurological diseases, heart disease, and pediatrics for dose reduction. However, the PET resolution and SNR is typically worse than MRI, and suffers from the loss of feature and data due to motion as well. PET/MRI systems offer the potential to create more accurate, higher resolution PET reconstructions, including correction of artifacts, motion, and im- proved localization, by performing synergistic reconstructions that leverage the simultaneous data acquisition. In particular, this fellowship proposes to develop novel physics-constrained machine learning models for informa- tion sharing between PET and MRI for enhanced spatial localization, estimation of attenuation and activity, and motion. We propose to develop a deep maximum-likelihood estimation of attenuation and activity (MLAA) that can compensate for artifacts and improve PET reconstruction accuracy. We also propose a motion-enhanced joint PET/MRI reconstruction to capture arbitrary motions and reduce dose requirements for chest and abdomen studies. Together, these models aim to improve the PET spatio-temporal resolution, SNR, and quantiﬁcation for a broad range of clinical applications, and will be evaluated for cancer assessment in the pelvis, liver, and lung.  This fellowship will be performed in the Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging at UCSF under the guidance of Prof. Peder Larson, who leads a research program on advanced imaging methods development, and Dr. Thomas Hope, a radiologist and nuclear medicine physician who leads multiple PET/MRI projects. The Department is one of the leading centers in biomedical imaging research, and has been at the forefront on translating PET/MRI systems into clinical practice. The UCSF PET/MRI scanner has dedicated research time, which is also available on other MRI and PET/CT research systems, and extensive computational resources to support the proposed project. The applicant, Dr. Abhejit Rajagopal, has a background in computational imaging and machine learning, will be jointly mentored by this engineer/physician team. He will be trained to become a biomedical imaging scientist by participating in formal coursework on medical imaging systems, training on the PET/MRI system, grant writing, and performing clinical research, supporting his development into a creative, independent biomedical researcher. Project Narrative  Hybrid positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) imaging systems cur- rently aid in diagnosis and prognosis of numerous types of cancer and disease, but are not always precise enough to accurately measure and track a patient’s response to therapy, particularly in organs and tissue that are sub- ject to motion. There is an unrealized potential here to synergistically combine complimentary PET-MRI data to dramatically improve the spatial resolution and SNR of PET, as well as to create motion-resolved 4D (x,y,z,t) imagery by combining information across modalities and time-frames to combat severe undersampling. These methods will be evaluated in human studies of cancer to capture ﬁne structure and micro-features on moving organs (e.g. lung nodules, liver metastases), ultimately aiding in quantitative characterization of disease.",Multi-modal and Extreme PET/MRI Reconstruction Methods,10069132,F32EB030411,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Chest', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Fellowship', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Implant', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metals', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Oncology', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Writing', 'attenuation', 'bioimaging', 'bone', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'combat', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging modality', 'imaging scientist', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'information model', 'lung imaging', 'method development', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'programs', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'soft tissue', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'systems research', 'uptake']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2020,69426,0.01645551527005515
"Deviceless and Autonomous Prospective Cardiac CT Triggering PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. An estimated 3.8 million men and 3.4 million women die each year from CHD. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive imaging modality used for diagnosing CHD and for planning therapeutic interventions. Cardiac CT exams are still challenging to perform due to the beating heart and the need to carefully time the scan based on cardiac phase and based on when the peak iodine contrast enhancement is reached. The overall exam duration and the complexity of performing these exams (contrasted with limited reimbursement levels) have limited patient access to cardiac CT to academic hospitals and specialized cardiac imaging centers. As compared to other CT exams, cardiac CT exams require additional patient preparation time, additional CT scans to track the bolus, and additional contrast agent to avoid missing the peak enhancement.  The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus. Initial results show that it is possible to extract cardiac gating information from a few CT projection measurements prior to the diagnostic CT scan, without reconstruction. This is made possible by an innovative combination of fast X-ray tube pulsing and deep learning raw data analysis. This project builds on GE Research's experience with cardiac CT technologies, deep learning algorithms and X-ray tube physics, as well as the strong clinical cardiac CT expertise at the University of California San Diego.  The outcome of this project will be a clinical feasibility study of the autonomous triggering approach, which has the potential to simplify and increase patient access to cardiac CT, while reducing exam time, reducing con- trast agent volume, and ensuring robust image quality. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus. The result will be a patient-friendly and technologist-friendly cardiac CT exam with reduced exam time, minimal contrast agent volume and radia- tion dose, and robust image quality.",Deviceless and Autonomous Prospective Cardiac CT Triggering,10029731,R01HL153250,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Bolus Infusion', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Ensure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Iodine', 'Measurement', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preparation', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'standard of care', 'temporal measurement', 'time interval']",NHLBI,GENERAL ELECTRIC GLOBAL RESEARCH CTR,R01,2020,1060608,0.018670560715960183
"Quantitative MRI of Multiple Sclerosis - Resubmission - 1 Project Summary  In this project, we propose a novel T1 and T2 quantification method that generates quantitative T1 or T2 maps from weighted MR images. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used as a tool to diagnose Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and track lesional changes over time. Because MRI has various contrasts that display different information about the underlying tissue microstructure and physiology, it can potentially be used as a tool to predict MS disease progression and even disability. However, there is no known measure derived from MR images of MS that correlates well with clinical disability as described by the Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS). Previous efforts to correlate MRI features and EDSS have included calculating total lesion load on T1- and T2-weighted images, measuring the variations in the magnetic transfer ration of normal-appearing brain tissues, and calculating cerebral atrophy, each with a varying level of success. Yet, there has been little study of the evolution of relaxation times of the lesions over time and how it relates to disability. Because changes in the T1 (spin-lattice) and T2 (spin-spin) relaxation times of a tissue can reflect pathological changes in that tissue over time, quantitative T1 and T2 maps derived from MR images may be more indicative of microscopic changes that manifest as disability in MS patients.  The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) develop and validate novel T1 and T2 quantification method on spin-echo MR images, (2) extend the novel quantification method to common MS imaging sequences, and (3) apply the novel quantification method to MS datasets to predict EDSS using machine learning. Aim 1 will involve the validation of the quantification pipeline on both T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo MR images in vivo, resulting in a range of acceptable parameters for the novel quantification method. Aim 2 will extend the quantification pipeline to include commonly used and more complicated MS imaging sequences, again resulting in a range of acceptable parameters for the quantification method. Aim 3 will use the quantification pipeline to compare machine learning algorithms with and without quantification to determine the added value of quantification in the imaging of MS. Additionally, Aim 3 will result in a predictive machine learning model utilizing multiple imaging contrasts for the prediction of disability in MS. These results will provide a more thorough understanding of the role of MR quantification in the evaluation of neurological diseases, such as MS, and will offer a scientific foundation to extend the use of MR quantification as a potential imaging biomarker for other diseases and pathologies. Project Narrative The proposed research aims to develop and validate a T1 and T2 quantification method using internal reference values derived from T1- or T2-weighted MR images. This method will be applied to weighted images of patients who have been diagnosed Multiple Sclerosis and input into various classification algorithms to determine which method is most predictive of worsening clinical disability as described by the Expanded Disability Status Score. By doing this, we will determine the impact of this novel quantification method as a tool for both the analysis of patients with Multiple Sclerosis as well as a tool for the normalization of big MR datasets before being input into machine learning algorithms.",Quantitative MRI of Multiple Sclerosis - Resubmission - 1,10154293,F31NS118930,"['Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Attenuated', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demyelinations', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neuraxis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Recovery', 'Reference Values', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'brain tissue', 'cerebral atrophy', 'classification algorithm', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'data harmonization', 'digital', 'disability', 'gray matter', 'healthy volunteer', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2020,45520,0.007247741761480888
"Prediction of Major Adverse Kidney Events and Recovery (Pred-MAKER) in COVID-19 Patients PROJECT SUMMARY  Major adverse kidney events (MAKE) are common in individuals hospitalized with COVID-19, particularly in the United States. Our data from Mount Sinai show that ~40% of hospitalized patients develop acute kidney injury (AKI); 20% of those need renal replacement therapy, and the mortality rate in patients that experience COVID-19 associated AKI is several-fold greater than patients without AKI. Furthermore, we have seen that the rate of non-recovery is also significantly higher compared to those observed in non-COVID AKI, highlighting the potential long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2-associated kidney damage. We propose to utilize the highly coordinated tissue and biospecimen collection machinery that has been initiated at the Mount Sinai Health System. As the largest hospital system at the epicenter of the crisis, Mount Sinai treated and discharged nearly 10,000 COVID-19 patients and created a central IRB approval and data coordination system under the auspices of the newly formed Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center. As part of biospecimen and clinical data collation efforts, we have consented and obtained blood, urine or clinically indicated kidney biopsy samples from over 700 patients at the time of admission.  Using these samples, we propose (1) to use a multipronged approach to determine the biomarkers that are associated with MAKE; (2) to develop a machine learning-based predictive algorithm using a combination of multiplexed biomarker expression levels and clinical metrics; and, (3) to determine cellular pathways that are responsible for COVID-associated AKI by combining multiomics interrogation of SARS-CoV-2 positive patient urine and kidney biopsies as well as the time-dependent transcriptomic signatures of in vitro primary proximal tubule cells.  First, our results will have an immediate translational outcome, which will help focus clinical efforts on high risk patients and triage low risk patients quicker. In addition, our proposal will lead to improved understanding of the complex disease mechanisms that cause the unique kidney injury signatures in COVID-19 and may lead to development of novel biomarkers and therapeutics that may prove beneficial during post-COVID clinical care. Our rigorous approach is innovative, and it is supported by established complementary assays. We have assembled an experienced multidisciplinary team encompassing bioengineers, nephrologists, basic scientists, informaticians and virologists that will help improve the understanding of the landscape of kidney outcomes during COVID-19 hospitalizations. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Kidney podocytes play an important role in kidney filtration. In order to perform this key biological function, the podocyte has to maintain a specialized structure that depends on a number of proteins. We identified a previously unknown protein, called nebulette, as a key component of the podocyte filtration machinery, and we propose to test its role in maintenance of the specialized structure of podocytes during health and disease. Our results will improve our understanding of podocyte biology and may identify new drug targets to treat kidney diseases such as diabetic nephropathy.",Prediction of Major Adverse Kidney Events and Recovery (Pred-MAKER) in COVID-19 Patients,10216732,R01DK118222,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coca', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Consultations', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Health system', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'In Situ', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nephrology', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteinuria', 'Proteomics', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scientist', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Triage', 'Tubular formation', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Vaccines', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'coronavirus disease', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'kidney biopsy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'podocyte', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'proteomic signature', 'renal damage', 'response', 'sample collection', 'spatiotemporal', 'transcriptomics', 'translational impact', 'urinary', 'virology']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,468762,0.049528021371247094
"Optimizing Acquisition and Reconstruction of Under-sampled MRI for Signal Detection PROJECT SUMMARY Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a versatile imaging modality that suffers from slow acquisition times which is a challenge for both time sensitive applications and for patient throughput. Accelerating MRI would benefit patients both by reducing the time they need to be in the scanner and in reducing the cost of healthcare. This project is part of a larger scientific effort to accelerate MRI while maintaining the diagnostic quality. Acceleration, even by a factor of two would result in a major advance for public health. Two of the current approaches to accelerate MRI rely on collecting less data (under-sampling) and constrained or deep learning reconstruction. These approaches can lead to images with diagnostic quality with significant under-sampling but may suffer from artifacts which are hard to characterize. Specifically, this project will optimize the performance of constrained reconstruction and deep learning on detecting subtle lesions in acquiring and reconstructing under-sampled MRI. To carry out this optimization, we will first develop the methods required for detection of lesions by machine and human observer models. Then the models will be validated by psychophysical studies where humans perform the detection task. In the first aim of this project, we will optimize constrained reconstruction based on the ideal linear observer. We will consider under-sampled acquisition strategies in 2D MRI including one and two dimensional subsampling methods with constrained reconstruction using both wavelet and total variation constraints. We will perform simulations using anatomical backgrounds both for lesions which match the prior information of the constraints and those which do not to better understand how choices in acquisition and reconstruction affect ideal detection. While the ideal linear observer approximates the best possible detection, typically the signal detection is carried out by a human. In the second aim, we will optimize constrained reconstruction using human observer models and validate the models using human observer studies. A recent approach to reconstruction of under- sampled images is based on deep learning. In the third aim, this work will optimize deep learning reconstruction based on ideal and human observers. Due to the complexity of the deep learning approach, having this task-based approach to optimization is particularly relevant. This project will optimize a network using signal detection to better understand how training and architecture choices in the neural network affect detection of lesions which are not included in training images. This research project will help to strengthen the research environment at Manhattan College by involving students in biomedical research incorporating applied mathematics, statistics and data science.

"Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival  Chronic kidney disease affects about 10% of adults in the United States and 7-12% of the population worldwide. It may lead to irreversible loss of kidney function, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For patients with ESRD, kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment compared to dialysis in terms of patient survival, quality of life and cost. Despite the advantages of kidney transplants, most patients with ESRD are treated with dialysis primarily because there exist an insufficient number of compatible donors for patients. The human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) of the organ donor and recipient are known to be a significant contributing factor to transplanted organ survival times due to immunogenicity, the immune response of the recipient to the transplanted organ. Mismatches between donor and recipient HLAs are associated with shorter survival times; however, it is extremely rare to identify donors that have a perfect match with recipients, so most transplants involve mismatched HLAs. Our main objective is to accurately predict survival times for kidney transplants by incorporating both data- driven models of HLA compatibility based on outcomes of past transplants and biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity. Accurate prediction of survival times can improve patient transplant outcomes by enabling more efficient allocation of donors and recipients, particularly by reducing the number of repeat transplants due to graft failure with a poorly matched donor. We propose to estimate HLA compatibilities using high-dimensional variable selection techniques applied to outcomes of past transplants and through a novel donor-recipient latent space model for the HLA compatibility network. We then propose to incorporate these predicted compatibilities along with biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity using amino acid sequences and epitopes into a multi-task classification-based survival prediction algorithm. Our proposed approach for learning integrated data- and biologically-driven models of transplant survival generalizes broadly to organ transplantation (liver, heart, pancreas, lungs) and possibly to bone marrow transplantation. Finding better methods for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient may redefine and improve clinical outcomes for organ and tissue transplants. In fact, new approach may revolutionize the selection of donors with recipients, thereby producing significantly improved long-term organ and tissue transplant survivals.",Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival ,9985180,R01LM013311,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens', 'Anus', 'Biological', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Donor Selection', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epitopes', 'HLA Antigens', 'Heart', 'Immune response', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ Donor', 'Organ Survival', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Science', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'base', 'cost', 'discrete time', 'graft failure', 'hazard', 'high dimensionality', 'human model', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'learning network', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'survival prediction', 'transplant model', 'treatment comparison']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO,R01,2020,277764,0.03789384031985989
"Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an invaluable tool for studying the early development of the brain and can resolve diagnostic ambiguities that may remain after routine ultrasound exams. Unfortunately, high levels of fetal and maternal motion (1) limit fetal MRI to rapid two-dimensional (2D) sequences and frequently introduce dramatic artifacts such as (2) image misorientation relative to the standard sagittal, coronal, axial planes needed for clinical assessment and (3) partial to complete signal loss. These factors lead to the inefficient practice of repeating ~30 s stack-of-slices acquisitions until motion-free images have been obtained. Throughout the session, technologists manually adjust the orientation of scans in response to motion, and about 38% of datasets are typically discarded. Thus, subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of MRI for answering clinical and investigational questions in the fetus. The overarching goal of this project is to overcome the challenges posed by motion by exploiting innovations in deep learning, which have enabled image-analysis algorithms with unprecedented speed and reliability. We propose to integrate these into the MRI acquisition pipeline to unlock the potential of fetal MRI. We will develop practical pulse-sequence technology for automated and dynamically motion-corrected fetal neuroimaging without the need for external hardware or calibration. We hypothesize that this will radically improve the quality and success rates of clinical and research studies, while dramatically reducing patient discomfort and cost. We propose as Aim 1 to eradicate (2) the vulnerability of acquisitions to image-brain misorientation with rapid, automated prescription of standard anatomical planes. In Aim 2, we propose to address (3) motion during the scan with real-time correction of fetal-head motion. An anatomical stack-of-slices acquisition will be interleaved with volumetric navigators. These will be used to measure motion as it happens in the scanner and to adaptively update the slice tilt/position. We propose as Aim 3 to develop a 3D radial sequence and estimate motion between subsets of radial spokes for real-time self-navigation. Adaptively updating the orientation of spokes and selectively re-acquiring corrupted subsets at the end of the scan will enable 3D imaging of the fetal brain (1). Since the applicant has a physics background, the proposed training program at MIT and HMS will focus on deep learning and fetal development/neuroscience during the K99 phase to develop the skills needed for transitioning to independence in the R00 phase. The applicant’s goal is to become a fetal image acquisition and analysis scientist acting as bridge between deep learning, MRI and clinical fetal-imaging applications to shift the boundaries of what is currently possible with state-of-the-art technology. Fulfilling the research aims will promote this, as it will result in a practical framework for automation and motion correction, applicable to a wide variety of fetal neuroimaging sequences. PROJECT NARRATIVE Subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging, as it frequently produces images with dramatic artifacts. The goal of this project is to exploit innovations in deep learning and integrate them into the acquisition pipeline to overcome the challenges posed by motion in fetal neuroimaging studies.

"Development of advanced cardiac SPECT imaging technologies Project Abstract Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) continues to play a critical role in the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease (CAD). While conventional SPECT scanners using parallel-hole collimators are still the foundation of cardiac SPECT, recently our field observed an exciting growth of new developments of dedicated cardiac scanners. Such dedicated scanners, such as the GE Alcyone 530/570c systems and the D-SPECT systems both with CZT detectors, typically have multiple detectors collecting photons emitted from the heart simultaneously, leading to dramatically improved sensitivity (2-5 X). In addition, the GE systems use pinhole collimators and can achieve much higher resolution. These dedicated scanners opened doors to new applications with significant clinical impact, including ultra-low-dose imaging, absolute quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), high resolution molecular imaging, multi-isotope imaging, motion correction, and many more. Most of these new applications are uniquely achievable only using dedicated scanners. While the dedicated cardiac SPECT systems can improve clinical practice and lead to numerous new clinical applications, such systems are far from being optimized to fully realize their great potentials. In this grant, we propose to systematically develop and optimize innovative imaging technologies for the GE 530/570c systems to further improve its clinical efficacy in a variety of significant ways. In Aim 1, we will develop and optimize methods for static cardiac SPECT imaging. We will develop various deep learning methods and investigate approaches to increase angular sampling to reduce noise, and improve resolution and quantitative accuracy. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate methods for dynamic SPECT imaging, particularly involving direct parametric image reconstruction. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate methods for dual-isotope SPECT. Monte Carso simulation and deep learning based methods will be developed for tracers with different spatial distributions and fast kinetics. In all three aims, large animal studies and human subject data will be used for optimization and validation.

"Understanding the role of the Complement Proteome in progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT There is a critical need to identify novel mechanisms of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) that will provide targets for new interventions. Chronic inflammation is one plausible mechanism. Using untargeted high-throughput aptamer proteomics, our recently published study has shed new light on specific, key inflammatory drivers of DKD. This was a large prospective three-cohort study that identified a novel and extremely robust circulating signature (KRIS) associated with risk of ESRD in diabetes. Our pilot study points to the data-driven connection between circulating KRIS and urinary profiles of the Complement pathway. Our hypothesis is that the Complement involvement in the kidney is a downstream effect of the systemic inflammatory processes mediating an increased DKD risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide a high-resolution view of the involvement of the Complement proteome in progressive diabetic kidney disease. Aim 1 will comprehensively evaluate the etiological role of the urinary Complement proteome in progressive DKD leading to ESRD. This evaluation will leverage a prospective two-cohort population of Joslin Kidney Study (JKS) participants with an overt DKD at baseline followed for 10 years (primary outcome – incident ESRD). Measurements will utilize an aptamer proteomic technology (SOMAscan). Aim 2 will extend generalizability of the urinary Complement proteome to earlier DKD stages. The proposed study will be conducted in participants of the Preventing Early Renal Loss (PERL) clinical trial with predominantly normal renal function at baseline followed for 3 years (primary outcome - renal slope). Aim 3 proposes to gain direct insight into the intra-renal Complement proteome by targeted and untargeted protein studies in diabetic kidney tissue (Susztaklab Biobank). This project focuses on a significant public health problem, leverages the progressiveness of the disease, employs an innovative proteomic technology and stems from strong preliminary data. Advances in this project will pinpoint missing key components of DKD etiology, thereby accelerating drug development strategies for patients with diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetes accounts for approximately 45% of prevalent ESRD cases in the United States, therefore new interventions to prevent or decelerate development of kidney failure are critical in order to improve the health of patients with diabetes who comprise a large sector of the US population. This study will advance our knowledge regarding the etiology of diabetic kidney complications evaluating specific components of systemic (KRIS) and local, kidney inflammation (Complement).

"Osteoarthritis: Quantitative Evaluation of Whole Joint Disease with MRI Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is an enormous clinical problem and worldwide cause of disability. Development of new therapies for OA is hampered by a lack of sensitive imaging tests that respond to changes in disease status. Recently FDA and CE approved clinical knee 7T MRI has the potential to add sensitivity and specificity to advanced MRI biomarkers of OA progression. This project will compare changes seen at 3T and 7T across two different vendors systems and assess the potential for 7T MRI to improve our ability to study and develop new disease- modifying therapies. This study will enhance future studies and clinical exams at 7T and can be used to improve routine 3T MRI though machine learning reconstruction and enhanced understanding of OA disease mechanisms. Understanding the relative strengths of 3T and 7T MRI in this important clinical application is critical to developing new disease-modifying treatments for patients with OA. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for development of disease-modifying treatments.

"Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging and automated textural radiomics for assessment of human placenta accreta spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY  Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) disorder is a condition in which the placenta fails to separate partially or totally from the uterine wall, resulting in significant intrapartum maternal morbidity and mortality at delivery. Depending on the extent of the placental invasion into surrounding tissue, hysterectomy may be lifesaving. Assessment of PAS severity prior to delivery is crucial for multidisciplinary surgical planning and patient counseling. However, there is an unmet clinical need for quantitative, objective measures of abnormal placentation that can serve as predictors of risk of invasion and hysterectomy. The overall goal of the proposed project is to prospectively assess PAS in high-risk women across gestation using quantitative multi-parametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and automated textural radiomics and to correlate findings with surgical outcomes.  Coming from a highly interdisciplinary background of MR chemistry, biology, and physics, the candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with in-depth knowledge and skills to conduct translational placental imaging research. The candidate's short-term goal is to complete a pilot study under the mentorship of an interdisciplinary advisory committee to evaluate PAS in women with high-risk pregnancies using multi-parametric MRI and textural radiomics.  To meet these goals, the following research aims are proposed: 1) Evaluate placental invasion across gestation using multi-parametric MR imaging and deep learning based novel quantification tools in PAS high- risk pregnancies, and 2) Extract the radiomic pattern across gestation of high-risk PAS placenta and determine its association with clinical surgical outcome. These research aims will serve as the platform for the career development plan and training aims which include: 1) Gain knowledge in translational prospective research design, 2) Improve technical skills in advanced clinical MR acquisition development, 3) Acquire applied statistical and data analysis skills, and 4) Develop mentorship and leadership skills while under training.  Together, the research and training aims will provide the training, experience and preliminary data for an R01 application. The future R01 will develop a clinical and surgical outcome prediction model for high-risk PAS pregnancies, potentially improving maternal and fetal outcomes. The training will position the candidate to become a leader in translational placental imaging research. PROJECT NARRATIVE After a woman has had a cesarean delivery, if the placenta implants on the surgical scar in a subsequent pregnancy, there is a risk for invasion, referred to as placenta accreta spectrum (PAS); depending on its severity, a cesarean hysterectomy may be required with significant morbidity. Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have shown promise in defining characteristics that alert the obstetrician to the severity of PAS. We will explore the vascularity and tissue characteristics of the placenta with MRI and identify quantitative predictive markers of disease severity and hope to better understand the pathophysiology of placenta accreta spectrum.",Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging and automated textural radiomics for assessment of human placenta accreta spectrum,10105139,K25HD104004,"['Abnormal placentation', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cellularity', 'Cesarean section', 'Characteristics', 'Chemistry', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Risk Woman', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Human', 'Hysterectomy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Perinatal', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Accreta', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Spin Labels', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uterus', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'fetal', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'implantation', 'improved', 'interest', 'intrapartum', 'maternal morbidity', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'recruit', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NICHD,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K25,2020,114184,-0.056982215917147944
"8th International CEST workshop (CEST2020) Project Summary/Abstract The 8th International Workshop of chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI in November 2020 (CEST2020) brings together an international community of experts in CEST imaging. CEST MRI has gained tremendous interest from the research community, and many leading institutions have joined forces to optimize CEST MRI and develop new applications in a host of diseases including acute stroke, epilepsy, and, most importantly, tumor imaging. Recently, machine learning and neuron networks have been explored for CEST imaging. The CEST 2020 forges research and learning opportunities for students and young researchers in a dedicated forum unmatched by other meetings. CEST 2020 is being organized by Phillip Zhe Sun, Ph.D. (Emory University), in conjunction with the CEST Workshop steering committee of well- established scholars in the CEST MRI field. It will run November 8-11, 2020, at the Emory Conference Center Hotel located on the Emory University campus in Atlanta, Georgia. The goal is to bring together researchers from varying backgrounds and clinicians from related disciplines and to provide a forum for communication among these multi-disciplinary groups. The workshop will feature a blend of plenary sessions, invited scientific presentations, manuscripts, poster presentations, and panel discussions.

"In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging ABSTRACT Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology, a primary protein abnormality in the rare diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is now recognized as a common age-related neuropathology, detected at autopsy in approximately 50% of older persons. According to recent evidence, TDP43 pathology in aging is associated with more rapid cognitive decline and higher odds of dementia, above and beyond contributions from Alzheimer’s and other age-related neuropathologies. In spite of its high frequency and deleterious effects, TDP43 can only be diagnosed at autopsy, and there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging by combining multimodal MRI and pathology in the same older persons from large community cohorts. Specifically, we propose to a) train TDP43 classifiers using machine learning based on ex- vivo MRI measurements of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical brain characteristics of older persons, b) translate these classifiers in-vivo, and c) test them in-vivo using longitudinal clinical, in-vivo MRI, and pathology data on older adults enrolled without dementia. We have generated a unique ex-vivo and in-vivo multimodal MRI-pathology database within the infrastructure of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG17917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), two longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical- pathologic cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates and high autopsy rates. Using our database, we have produced compelling preliminary results in support of our aims. First, we have demonstrated that ex-vivo brain MRI data can be linked to in-vivo MRI data. Second, we show that TDP43 pathology is related to specific brain MRI characteristics independent of other age-related pathologies. Third, we show high TDP43 classification performance (AUC=0.81) based on ex-vivo MRI features in persons with as well as without comorbid Alzheimer’s pathology (a common coexisting pathology). Fourth, we demonstrate that the confidence score obtained from ex-vivo MRI classification is linked to the progression of deposition of TDP43 pathology (i.e. TDP43 stages). Finally, we translated a preliminary ex-vivo TDP43 classifier for use in-vivo and demonstrated in a small sample that it has high in-vivo classification performance, and is independently associated with lower cognition. We propose to further develop and test this promising in-vivo MRI classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology is now recognized as a common and deleterious age-related neuropathology, however, there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging, and diagnosis is only possible at autopsy. The objective of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in older community- dwelling persons with and without dementia, based on a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical characteristics of the brain. Successful completion of the proposed work will have broad immediate implications in refining participant selection in clinical trials, as well as long term implications in the advancement of translational research and targeted disease-specific therapeutic approaches.",In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging,9993218,R01AG064233,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Autopsy', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'follow-up', 'frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'in vivo', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'recruit', 'religious order study', 'response']",NIA,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,655533,-0.013969734722659789
"Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred or fibrotic heart tissue plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive, multifaceted imaging modality and is the clinical gold standard for scar and fibrotic cardiac tissue imaging with use of gadolinium-based contrast injection. However, administration of such gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired kidney function? a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. Until recently, GBCA was presumed to be safe in patients with normal kidney function; however, there are emerging data on long-term GBCA retention in the body. We aim to develop two complimentary approaches to reduce GBCA use in myocardial, or cardiac muscle, scar imaging. Initially, we will develop a quantitative risk-benefit model to identify NICM patients with a low chance of having scarred myocardium. Concurrently, we will develop a GBCA-free cardiac MR myocardial tissue probe platform based on AI (MyoProbe.ai) to quantify scarred regions of the heart. To accomplish this, we will develop and evaluate an individualized, patient-specific scar prediction model to reduce GBCA use in NICM patients with different etiologies by training the model to learn to identify whether the patient is likely to have scarring based on non-contrast images. If it is unlikely that a patient has scarring, contrast administration can be avoided. To develop and evaluate MyoProbe.ai for GBCA-free quantification of myocardial scar in CHD patients, we will use AI to integrate signal intensity and heart motion data from MRI images to accurately locate and quantify scar tissue. This information can then be used by cardiologists to diagnose and treat the patient. We will rigorously validate our risk-benefit model and AI myocardial probe platform using retrospectively and prospectively collected cardiac MRI images from multiple healthcare centers, MRI vendors, and magnetic field strengths. Our dataset will include different types of NICM and CHD patient populations to ensure that our work is applicable to patients with many different types of NICM and CHD. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred/fibrotic heart tissue with gadolinium- based contrast agents (GBCA) plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). However, administration of GBCAs prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, contaminates surface and drinking water, is retained in the body long-term, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired renal function– a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. The goal of our study is to reduce or eliminate GBCA use in cardiac MR scar imaging using artificial intelligence (AI) by concurrently developing a quantitative model to identify NICM patients with a low likelihood of scarring and a GBCA-free cardiac MR AI platform to quantify scar tissue.",Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis,10072898,R01HL154744,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Fibrosis', 'Fostering', 'Gadolinium', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired Renal Function', 'Impairment', 'Injections', 'Ischemia', 'Kidney', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reference Standards', 'Relaxation', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surface', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drinking water', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'radiomics']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,946194,0.07657212284222974
"Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates 7. Project Summary This K23 proposal will provide Xingxing S. Cheng, MD, MS with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to become an independent clinical investigator. Dr. Cheng is a board-certified nephrologist and accredited transplant nephrologist, with a long-term vision of improving the effectiveness of health care for kidney transplant patients. She seeks to combine patient-oriented research and decision science to find innovative solutions to clinical problems. Skills she will acquire in this grant, under the guidance of a strong mentorship team, include 1) integration of patient-oriented research and decision analytic models; 2) assessing the heterogeneity of response in different patient subgroups; and 3) advanced modelling skills. This grant proposes to refine the process of screening of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease on the wait-list awaiting kidney transplantation. Currently, patients undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, few of which result in interventions. These tests impose a high treatment burden on patients and potentially delay time to transplant, while bringing unclear benefit to the patient. This grant proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients with diabetes mellitus). It will examine strategies that vary the frequency of cardiac testing and risk stratification for cardiac testing based on a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive test that can be performed in routine clinical settings, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). This project will achieve this broad aim by three specific aims: 1) to characterize the 6MWT in identifying low-risk patients who do not additional cardiac testing; 2) to model strategies varying the frequency of cardiac testing and use of 6MWT; 3) to design strategies personalized for specific patient subgroups and model them in the entire kidney transplant candidate population of the United States (US). The first two aims will arise from a well-characterized cohort of patients at Dr. Cheng’s institution. Machine-learning systems will be used to identify which patient subgroups are best served by which strategies (i.e. the heterogeneity of response). The third aim will leverage the US Renal Data System, which Dr. Cheng’s mentors and institution has a track record of leveraging for innovative research. The proposed work has high potential to make a significant clinical impact. Its completion will enable the identification and characterization of rational strategies for pre-transplant screening of coronary artery disease that may be incorporated into clinical practice or pave the way for a future multi-center comparative effectiveness trial. The proposed work is realistic and feasible within the award period, and will allow Dr. Cheng to build research skills, advance and disseminate scientific knowledge, create additional collaborative networks, and compete for R01 or equivalent funding. In summary, the K23 award will provide the support to enable Dr. Cheng to become a successful independent clinical investigator. 8. Project Narrative Currently, patients on the kidney transplant waitlist undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, but relatively few interventions result. This project proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients without diabetes mellitus), by examining strategies that reduce the frequency of cardiac testing and use performance-based risk stratification to reduce the number of patients who need cardiac testing.

"Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The inability of non-invasive techniques to quantify disease progression has limited understanding of the pathogenesis of OA. While numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been proposed for imaging OA, sensitivity to bone metabolism has been limited. We propose to develop advanced three-dimensional PET-MRI methods for bone and soft tissue metabolism to study the response of the tissues in the joint to changes in knee load. This work will lead to a new understanding of OA pathogenesis by revealing relationships between changes in cartilage and bone metabolism over time. This project aims to develop PET-MRI methods to sensitively track changes of OA in response to biomechanical loading. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop accurate, reproducible and dose-optimized kinetic models of dynamic 18F-NaF PET-MRI for quantitative bilateral whole joint imaging using deep learning and advanced MR coil technology, (2) Study the relationship between resting state bone metabolism and biomechanics using PET- MRI and (3) Perform a longitudinal study to assess the response of our new imaging methods to changes in joint biomechanics from gait retraining. The innovation of this work lies in the development of novel imaging techniques that simultaneously offer quantitative measures of tissue physiology in cartilage and bone using PET-MRI. The significance of this work is that we will be able to sensitively and quantitatively track changes in bone metabolism and soft tissue microstructure due to changes in biomechanical loading in the knee joint over time. This will provide new and more sensitive imaging tools to assess the responses of the joint to biomechanical interventions to treat OA such as gait retraining, bracing, or high tibial osteotomy. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for assessment of disease-modifying treatments such as bracing or gait modification. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using positron-emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health during mechanical treatment of osteoarthritis. !",Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis,9997783,R01AR074492,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Arthralgia', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Matrix', 'Bone Spur', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone remodeling', 'Canes', 'Cartilage', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fluoride Ion', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Needs Assessment', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteotomy', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sclerosis', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone', 'bone metabolism', 'cartilage metabolism', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'flexibility', 'gait examination', 'gait rehabilitation', 'imaging approach', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'joint loading', 'kinetic model', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'mineralization', 'molecular marker', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'soft tissue', 'subchondral bone', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,435694,0.026892621392424307
"Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI PROJECT SUMMARY It was long taken for granted that obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is the primary driver of angina and major adverse cardiac events. However, recent landmark studies have shown that up to 50% of the patients referred for diagnostic testing have ischemia with no obstructive CAD (INOCA). A large proportion of INOCA patients have coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), which even in the absence of flow-limiting stenoses can lead to myocardial ischemia and carries a high risk of adverse events. The reference standard for assessment of CMD is the functional coronary reactivity (CR) test, which is invasive. Despite key studies showing value of stratifying therapy based on CR testing, the practical utility of CR testing in the INOCA population is limited by its invasive nature, which carries serious risks even at experienced centers. Hence, a noninvasive approach that can detect and stage the severity of CMD would be invaluable for managing INOCA patients. Driven by this unmet need, prior studies have employed imaging approaches to index myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) against CR; however, the association shown to date between MPR and CR impairment has been weak, likely due to the suboptimal sensitivity of MPR to subendocardial myocardial blood flow (MBF) deficits which is a hallmark of CMD. Studies using invasive microsphere-based methods have established a stress subendocardial-to-subepicardial (endo-epi) MBF gradient of larger than 1.0 in healthy animals, and shown that it decreases well below 1 under abnormally elevated microvascular resistance. However, noninvasive detection of endo-epi MBF gradients using existing imaging strategies is challenging because of the need to resolve MBF transmurally. We have developed new MRI strategies aimed at overcoming key barriers for accurate evaluation of endo-epi MBF gradients and applied them in preliminary animal and patient studies. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in the setting of CMD, impaired microvascular CR manifests as a stress-induced endo- epi MBF gradient, and the magnitude of this gradient significantly correlates with CMD severity. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a free-breathing artifact-free MRI technique optimized for high-resolution imaging of endo-epi MBF gradients, combined with a machine learning approach for fully-automated objective quantification of MBF gradients. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity can be staged on the basis of MRI-derived stress MBF gradient in a pig model of CMD. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity in INOCA patients is highly correlated with MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. This project brings together multiple interdisciplinary investigators with a strong collective track record in developing cardiac imaging strategies to advance a noninvasive approach for determining CMD severity based on the MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. Hence the proposal is a major step towards improving the management of INOCA patients and towards imaging-guided evaluation of novel therapies aimed at CMD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent landmark studies have provided evidence that “small vessel” coronary dysfunction in patients with otherwise normal coronary arteries is a major cause of heart disease and can lead to poor health outcomes including heart failure. This research proposal seeks to develop a noninvasive approach for diagnosis and monitoring of small-vessel coronary dysfunction by developing innovative and reliable magnetic resonance imaging strategies. Our proposal has the potential to improve patient care in this population by providing a noninvasive alternative to the established invasive testing procedure, which carries a risk of complications and is only available at highly specialized medical centers.",Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI,10037606,R01HL153430,"['Animals', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family suidae', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microspheres', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Nature', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Systole', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vasodilator Agents', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'recruit', 'sequence learning']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,699398,0.0006319281076197273
"In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones OVERALL SUMMARY  The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and inefficient emergency department visits that typically include repetitive exposure to ionizing radiation from diagnostic imaging, and will significantly reduce the often lengthy (days to weeks) wait time patients must endure before procedures for stone removal can be scheduled and performed. As the proposed therapy system is entirely noninvasive, patients will be treated on an outpatient basis. Further, as the system is designed to efficiently and painlessly break stones of any size and expel the fragments from the kidney, the treatment of both symptomatic and asymptomatic stones using this technology will reduce the high retreatment and stone event recurrence rates associated with current surgical interventions for stone removal.  In this effort, we will combine stone breakage by burst wave lithotripsy (BWL), clearance of fragments by ultrasonic propulsion (UP), and stone-specific ultrasound imaging (S-mode) into an integrated system in which exposure strategies are adapted during treatment in response to real-time acoustic feedback to enhance comminution efficiency and patient safety. We will tailor treatment by investigating numerically and in lab tests the primary mechanisms - cavitation and elastic waves - involved in the comminution process over a broad parameter space. We will develop acoustics-based feedback including model- based, machine learning and passive acoustic mapping (PAM) of the bubble field to signal the need to adjust the energy output. We will investigate the morphological and functional response of the kidney in living animals and in ex vivo perfused porcine kidneys, and pursue tissue protective treatment strategies such as power ramping.  These studies will include the first in-human test of BWL in which we will compare the comminution effectiveness and safety of treatment with and without adaptive output control in response to acoustic feedback. In addition, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of the benefits and risks of fragmenting and expelling symptomatic and asymptomatic stones in the clinic. Toward application of the system for use in humans, we will refine and validate the use of UP and S-mode together to improve stone and fragment detection. With our eye on the future of stone management, we will develop and validate in vivo an extracorporeal acoustic tractor beam to grasp and carry fragments through the complex three- dimensional path of the urinary space and out of the kidney. OVERALL NARRATIVE Urinary stone disease, which affects 1 in 11 Americans, is one of the most painful diseases and also the costliest non-malignant urologic disease, because current management is limited to observation for the stone to pass or performing surgery. The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based, handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and temporizing emergency department visits and radiation exposing imaging while the patient waits in pain for days to weeks for the stone to pass or be surgically removed.","In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones",10005352,P01DK043881,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Bowman&apos', 's space', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lithotripsy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Non-Malignant', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Painless', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Publications', 'Radiation exposure', 'Ramp', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Tissue', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retreatment', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Wait Time', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'calcification', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'grasp', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individualized medicine', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'response', 'safety study', 'simulation', 'structured data', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P01,2020,1567293,0.009092131511796055
"Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI Project Summary We propose a technical feasibility study seeking to develop methods for quantitative kinematic proﬁling of moving joints using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the context of this study, a kinematic proﬁle is deﬁned as a collection of joint characteristics computed and tracked during the course of movement. This project is motivated by the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. At a high level, it is envisioned that the proposed kinematic proﬁles could ﬁt into clinical management workﬂows much in the same way as blood biomarker panels.  While kinematic imaging of joints can be performed using plain-ﬁlm (PF) X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound (US) methods, MRI is the gold-standard for advanced orthopedic assessment and is an appealing option for accessory kinematic analysis. A set of relatively fast kinematic proﬁling acquisitions could feasibly be added to routine orthopedic MRI exams, thereby providing optimal diagnostic imaging in both static and kinematic contexts within a single visit.  Though several preliminary studies have hinted at the potential diagnostic value of kinematic imaging data, such data is difﬁcult to interpret and cannot easily be quantiﬁed or captured in clinical records. In this study, we seek to establish fundamental methods that can provide simple and easily digestible kinematic imaging reports with data acquired in a short scan interval using conventional clinical MRI equipment.  As a preliminary feasibility investigation of these methods, kinematic imaging of the wrist will be studied. Dysfunction of the scaphoid and lunate bones in the wrist is a well-studied kinematic problem of diagnostic signiﬁcance. Novel 4D zero-echo-time MRI of the wrist will be used to capture the kinematic imaging using for proﬁling of the scaphoid-lunate mechanics during two established wrist movement patterns.  The goal of this project is to establish and demonstrate methodological components required for MRI kinematic proﬁling. Data collection on a modest-sized cohort of 100 healthy control subjects is proposed for this purpose. Novel MRI pulse-sequence and post-processing development components are introduced and tasked for analysis of this normative data. Using the acquired MRI data, kinematic parameters for each dynamic dataset will be extracted and curated into a multi-parametric proﬁle for each subject.  Aim 2 of the study proposes the use of external sensor motion capture methods to validate the MRI-based kinematic parameter measurements on 50% of the study cohort.  Finally, Aim 3 of the study seeks to use machine-learning clustering approaches to develop a kinematic proﬁle normalization procedure using the acquired control dataset. Such normalization is a crucial milestone in the translation of kinematic proﬁling to the clinic and will establish a baseline for future translational studies of symptomatic cohorts. Project Narrative We seek to develop and demonstrate fundamental methods in quantitative kinematic proﬁling using clinical diagnostic imaging equipment. This technical development project is constructed under the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. Using currently available advanced magnetic resonance imaging technology, data collected from a controlled subject cohort will be used to develop and test the proposed kinematic proﬁling technology on the moving wrist.",Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI,9893679,R21AR075327,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Process', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Film', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Scaphoid bone', 'Semilunar Bone', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Wrist joint', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'blood perfusion', 'bone', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'heart function', 'high resolution imaging', 'human subject', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'joint mobilization', 'kinematics', 'motion sensor', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'soft tissue', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'translational study', 'volunteer', 'water diffusion']",NIAMS,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2020,214720,0.04651842505839964
"CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI Renewal CARDIA Y35 Brain MRI Renewal Ancillary Study Abstract Many studies have established strong relationships between cerebrovascular disease (CEVD), morphological and physiological brain changes, including stroke, and cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer disease and related disorders (ADRD). New physiological and functional MRI (fMRI) methods allow non- invasive measurement of regional cerebral blood flow, vascular reactivity and physiological brain connectivity. These techniques provide the means to evaluate the morphology, pathophysiology, and brain dysfunction related to CEVD and ADRD. The CARDIA Year 25 and Year 30 Brain MRI Substudies were designed to incorporate state-of-the-art MRI technology into the relatively younger population of CARDIA in order to determine MRI correlates of CVD risk factors and detect early CEVD. These studies documented early MRI changes of CEVD with strong correlations to CVD risk factors, particularly hypertension. The CARDIA Year 35 MRI Ancillary Study is intended to extend these earlier studies into the late middle age population of CARDIA. Most biomarkers of CEVD and ADRD are weakly expressed until approximately age 55, when they begin their precipitous rise to the steep slope evident in the 6th and 7th decades of life. Correspondingly, subclinical disease becomes clinically evident, reflected by increasing physiological changes and cognitive deficits. However, confounding the effects of CEVD are age, lifestyle, and co-morbidities, including ADRD. CARDIA, with its lengthy and rich historical data, is well-positioned to dissect the intricacies of CEVD and putative relationship to ADRD in the transition from middle age to seniority, starting at ages with few comorbidities and low medication use. Approximately 1044 participants will be enrolled in the Ancillary Study from the four participating Field Centers. MRI participants will be recruited from previous CARDIA Brain MRI participants and receive brain MRI scans and cognitive testing as defined for Y25 and Y30. Computer analysis of MRI data will be reported quantitatively by anatomic regions-of-interest. The primary objectives are to: 1) enhance statistical power to better document previously described and newly defined associations between demographic measures, risk factors and brain MRI findings, 2) define MRI parameters most strongly associated with clinical events and cognitive changes, and 3) identify early MRI biomarker patterns that inform disease pathophysiology and progression at an individual level. CARDIA Y35 Brain MRI Renewal Ancillary Study Project Narrative The CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI ancillary proposal will study the long-term associations between cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease risk factors, brain MRI findings, clinical events, and cognitive changes in young and mid adulthood as reflected in the CARDIA population. Early-onset and mid-life clinical events and cognitive changes in conjunction with a third brain MRI study and cognitive testing will allow us to define MRI pattern subtypes better reflecting pathophysiological variants reflective of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. The primary objectives are to: 1) enhance statistical power to better document previously described and newly defined associations between demographic measures, risk factors and brain MRI findings. 2) define MRI parameters most strongly associated with clinical events and cognitive changes reflective of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, and 3) identify new, early MRI biomarker patterns that inform disease pathophysiology and progression at an individual level.",CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI Renewal,10017840,R01AG062819,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Ancillary Study', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Analysis', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'aging population', 'blood pressure regulation', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain volume', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive testing', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'early onset', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'men', 'middle age', 'neuroimaging', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'sex', 'study population', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,1444766,0.01904460094902963
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease,9903426,R01HL115828,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Common Ventricle', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Sex Differences', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'adverse outcome', 'analysis pipeline', 'aortic valve', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical translation', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data archive', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'shear stress', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue degeneration', 'tool', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,747084,0.07508820479849071
"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantification is crucial for clinical management of these children. This work will develop accurate and automated pediatric MRI for quantification of kidney function and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction.",Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification,9852445,R01EB026136,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac Output', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Cone', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Obstruction', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Reflux', 'Regimen', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Plasma Flow', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Urinary tract', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Work', 'antimicrobial drug', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney imaging', 'loss of function', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pressure', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'urinary', 'urinary tract obstruction', 'urologic']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,662001,0.07665253751559727
"Identifying Resident and Immune Cell Injury Responses in the Human Kidney Kidney function, both under normal conditions and in the setting of injury or disease, is predominantly controlled by the amount, localization and activation state of proteins in specific cells at specific sites and under specific spatial influences that in turn regulate cell differentiation, division, metabolism, morphology, membrane polarization, secretion and transport. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) takes advantage of laser ionization and time of flight mass spectrometry to simultaneously identify >40 metal ion-conjugated antibodies from tissue sections at 1micron resolution with essentially no background signal. By mixing cell specific antibodies and activation state-specific antibodies in the same cocktail, IMC produces a spatially preserved analysis of the location and activation state of multiple cell types from the same tissue section. We have developed a panel of 21 antibodies for simultaneous kidney section hybridization and IMC analysis, and a machine-learning based analysis pipeline that has allowed us to provide the first quantitative atlas of the number and location of the tubular, endothelial, glomerular and interstitial cells in the normal human kidney (Singh et al., JCI-Insight, in press). We now propose to validate an additional 22-29 antibodies for an expansion of this panel so as to provide information on the immune activation state and resident epithelial and endothelial cell injury, survival and death pathway responses predicted to be important in the injured human kidney. We will first perform in vitro validation of antibodies that detect cell injury/dedifferentiation states, survival pathways (autophagy, unfolded protein response, proliferation), and cell death/senescence pathways (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, senescence, Specific Aim 1), as well as immune cell populations and their activation states (Specific Aim 2). We will then perform IMC/Kidney-MAPPS based validation of the composite panel using carefully characterized human kidney biopsies from patients with defined clinical insults and morphologically quantified tubular and endothelial injury (Specific Aim 3). The end product of this proposal will be to provide a validated set of antibodies that can be used to accurately quantify cell injury states and subsequent responses across a spectrum of human kidney diseases. These antibodies can then be used by investigators who perform multiplexed imaging of the kidney, including IMC, IONpath MIBI cytometry, Tissue Cytometry and Repeated Fluorescent Imaging to mechanistically interrogate human AKI. Acute Kidney Injury is an important cause of in-hospital morbidity and mortality. While we have a great understanding of the biological events in animal models of kidney injury, we have much less understanding of the events that cause human kidney Injury. This proposal is designed to develop the resources needed to study human kidney injury and thus inform better clinical trials of treatments to both prevent kidney injury and improve recovery.",Identifying Resident and Immune Cell Injury Responses in the Human Kidney,9954680,R21AG067335,"['Ablation', 'Acute', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Activation', 'Apoptosis', 'Atlases', 'Autophagocytosis', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Cytometry', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Development', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Female', 'Formalin', 'Grant', 'Heavy Metals', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Interstitial Nephritis', 'Intervention', 'Ions', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nephrectomy', 'Paraffin', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Tissues', 'Tubular formation', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'analysis pipeline', 'antibody conjugate', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical referral center', 'cell injury', 'cell type', 'clinical diagnostics', 'design', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'eosinophil', 'fluorescence imaging', 'human imaging', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'injured', 'insight', 'interstitial cell', 'ionization', 'ischemic injury', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney cell', 'kidney imaging', 'living kidney donor', 'macrophage', 'male', 'mast cell', 'mortality', 'multiplexed imaging', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenome', 'predicting response', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'quantum', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'response to injury', 'screening', 'senescence', 'time of flight mass spectrometry', 'tumor']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,251250,-0.007081476519332102
"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism,9999688,K23NS105944,"['Affect', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical assessments', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Red nucleus structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Subjects Selections', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning classifier', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromelanin', 'neuron loss', 'nigrostriatal system', 'novel', 'pars compacta', 'patient screening', 'putamen', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,192564,0.026297427307144555
"Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in ~20% of cardiac surgical patients. Several cohort and registry studies have reported that AKI defined by rise in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery associates with development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events. However, it is unclear which patients will develop long-term adverse kidney events, adverse cardiovascular events, or both. In recent years blood and urine AKI biomarkers have been identified that reflect different aspects of AKI biology and that detect serum creatinine defined AKI earlier than rise in serum creatinine or detect subclinical AKI that is not revealed by traditional serum creatinine assessment. Clinical outcomes and biomarker research has focused mainly on detecting cardiac surgery- associated AKI itself, but not on predicting which patients are at greatest risk for long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after AKI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that perioperative blood and urine AKI biomarkers significantly associate with increased long-term (2 to 5 years) postoperative major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MAKE is defined as the composite of dialysis, death, renal hospitalization, or ≥ 30 day postoperative eGFR decline >25% from preoperative baseline. MACE is defined as the composite of death or hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, arrhythmia, or stroke. We propose a prospective observational cohort study of 610 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years following cardiac surgery. Based on preliminary data we will assess plasma NT-pro- B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma intact fibroblast growth factor 23, serum cystatin C, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 AKI biomarkers preoperatively and at 5 postoperative time points. This proposal will address three specific aims: 1) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MAKE during long-term follow-up; 2) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MACE during long-term follow-up; and 3) To develop clinical prediction models for long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional regression modeling, we will use machine learning that leverages detailed perioperative data including time-varying intraoperative and intensive care unit clinical data and blood and urine AKI biomarker data to create high performing prediction models. Our proposal is significant because knowing what blood and urine AKI biomarkers and clinical parameters accurately predict long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after cardiac surgery provides the foundation for clinical trials that will identify effective short and long-term interventions for patients at highest risk. Our proposal is innovative because clinical and biomarker data has not been leveraged in this way to predict long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because combining blood and urine acute kidney injury biomarkers and clinical data to identify cardiac surgical patients at highest risk for long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes will allow interventional studies to better individualize clinical management to prevent these outcomes. While acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is associated with increased long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (~25% incidence), it remains unclear which patients with postoperative acute kidney injury are at highest risk. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that can be applied to enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability.",Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery,9930135,R01HL148448,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Anesthesiology', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Applications Grants', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain natriuretic peptide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Science', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Foxes', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nephrology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasma', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Transfusion', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'health record', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'post gamma-globulins', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rat KIM-1 protein']",NHLBI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,797215,0.03177288592440823
"Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), resulting from drug exposure, infection or autoimmune disease, is the cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in up to 20% of patients who undergo a kidney biopsy. Even though we currently have 2 clinical interventions available to treat patients with AIN (withdrawal of the offending drug and corticosteroids), 40-60% of patients with AIN go on to develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) even when appropriately treated. Kidney damage in AIN is believed to result from immune-mediated tubular injury that eventually leads to fibrosis and permanent kidney damage.  The recent dileniation of the immune underpinnings of multiple autoimmune diseases and cancers has led to the development of targeted therapies that exhibit improved efficacy and less toxicity compared to corticosteroids. Therefore, an analysis of the immune infiltrate and resulting resident cell (tubular and vascular) responses that provides pathogenic understanding of the specific immune events that initiate and propogate AIN should lead to development and/or repurposing of targeted therapies that are more effective at resolving AIN and preventing the progression to CKD, as well as potentially less toxic.  Data from several groups, including our own, suggest that CD4+ T-helper cells (particularly the TH2/TH9 subsets) are potential drivers of AIN. We have found that TH2/TH9 cytokines IL-5 and IL-9 and some cells of type 2 immunity, mast cells and eosinophils, are higher in the urine or kidneys of patients with AIN. Based on these data, it is our hypothesis that TH2/TH9 T-helper cells in the kidney itself play an important pathogenic role in promoting tubular or vascular injury in AIN. We will test this hypothesis by performing a quantitative evaluation of the kidney immune infiltrate and accompanying tubular and vascular response in humans with AIN. We will use existing kidney biopsies, adjudicated by 3 nephropathologists as exhibiting AIN, from two university health centers (Yale and Johns Hopkins), as discovery and validation cohorts for this study. To perform the quantitative analysis we will use an imaging technique called Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) that supports the simultaneous, spatially-preserved quantification of up to 42 antibodies on a single tissue section. We have an existing library of 27 validated kidney and immune antibodies and have developed a machine learning protocol to rapidly and accurately quantify and localize all cells in the human kidney identified using IMC.  We will first increase our validated antibody panel and optimize our IMC protocol for use in the study of AIN (SA 1). We will then use IMC to identify, quantify and localize the immune and resident cell responses in 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN control biopsies from Yale (discovery cohort), followed by 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN controls from JHU (validation cohort, SA 2). Finally, we will define the relationship between cellular determinants of AIN and recovery of kidney function as well as response to steroids (SA3). Our findings will not only lead to identification of novel druggable targets in AIN, but also lead to improving clinical histological diagnosis of AIN. Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) is an important cause of kidney dysfunction, and can lead to chronic kidney disease in many patients. We know that AIN occurs as an immune response in the kidney to certain drugs or infections, but do not have a clear understanding of the cell sources of the inflammation or the tubular and vascular responses. This proposal is designed to define these immune events in human kidney biopsy samples left over after clinical diagnosis has been completed, and to determine how they relate to the development of chronic kidney disease.",Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis,10096452,R01DK126815,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Archives', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Delayed Hypersensitivity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Fibrosis', 'Formalin', 'Health', 'Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-5', 'Interleukin-9', 'Interstitial Nephritis', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Neighborhoods', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Renal function', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Steroids', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Preservation', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Tubular formation', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Withdrawal', 'adjudicate', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'eosinophil', 'exhaust', 'improved', 'injured', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney dysfunction', 'mast cell', 'multiphoton imaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'renal damage', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'vascular injury']",NIDDK,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,564483,0.03176184758319413
"Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee Project Abstract Motivation: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful disease that affects tens of millions of Americans, but is poorly understood, resulting in a lack of treatments. Enabling low-cost approaches for widespread study of risk factors, onset and early progression of OA will enable better understanding of OA mechanisms, treatment development, and triage of patients to different treatments based on speciﬁc disease phenotypes. Multiple systemic factors, biochemical factors, and other risk factors are associated with OA, but causes are difﬁ- cult to isolate and study during slow progression. Currently OA is diagnosed as joint-space narrowing using X-ray radiography, at a stage well beyond when interventions can be effective. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of- fers sensitivity to morphologic and biochemical changes, but most methods are impractical for widespread clinical or research use. Usually MRI exams study only one knee, precluding the opportunity to compare knees. Sim- ilarly, biomechanics assessment typically requires numerous tests using advanced and rarely-available equip- ment and time-intensive analysis by skilled personnel, making this a challenge for widespread use. We have shown rapid, simultaneous 3D scanning of both knees with quantitative relaxometry and diffusion map- ping of connective tissues, combined with novel visualization of longitudinal change validated in a population with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. We have developed fully-automated cartilage and meniscus seg- mentation to simplify post-processing. (Our automated cartilage segmentation variability approaches that of reader-to-reader variability.) We now propose to combine MRI acquisition, reconstruction and analysis tech- niques with simple measures of kinematics into a widely applicable low-cost imaging and biomechanical test, which we will validate in subjects with ACL-injury and subjects with varying Kellgren-Lawrence grades of OA. Approach: We will begin by developing a robust 5-to-8-minute bilateral knee MRI exam, using an efﬁcient 3D isotropic acquisition and novel deep-learning based image reconstructions. This will be followed with automated cartilage segmentation and quantitative analysis (thickness, T2, diffusion) of all 3 knee plates and automated semiquantitative scoring approaches for synovitis, bone marrow and cartilage lesions. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) will be used to measure kinematics, and gait asymmetries. We will continue our studies in ACL pa- tients to validate techniques and to develop asymmetry analyses for both imaging and biomechanical measures. Finally, in subjects with varying OA grade, we will evaluate the potential of the overall low-cost approach to relate asymmetry and longitudinal change measures to progression and OA grade. Signiﬁcance: This project will develop an acquisition and analysis pipeline to quantify knee changes and left/right asymmetries that precede OA. We will characterize methods in idiopathic OA subjects and ACL- injured subjects at risk of post-traumatic OA. The very low target cost, under $120/subject, will ultimately enable widespread study of early onset and progression of different OA types, leading to earlier and better treatments. Project Narrative Osteoarthritis remains the leading cause of disability, and effective treatment will require efﬁcient assessment of disease risk-factors, onset, and progression, both for development and personalization of minimally invasive interventions. We propose a 5-minute 3D MRI exam of both knees without radiation or contrast injection, that will be combined with low-cost measures of knee motion and fully automated analysis methods to provide quan- titative measurements of cartilage, tendon, ligament, bone and ﬁbrocartilage health and asymmetries between knees. This low-cost, rapid, bilateral assessment will enable research studies in large populations, as well as adding quantitative bilateral information to clinical scans to dramatically improve understanding of onset of dif- ferent types of osteoarthritis.",Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee,10032904,R01AR077604,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anterior Cruciate Ligament', 'Articulation', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Spur', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cost Measures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Fibrocartilages', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammatory', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kellgren-Lawrence grade', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Left', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Slice', 'Surface', 'Synovitis', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'analysis pipeline', 'anterior cruciate ligament injury', 'anterior cruciate ligament rupture', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'gait examination', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'learning classifier', 'meniscus injury', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'sensor', 'societal costs', 'therapy development', 'tissue biomarkers']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,658342,0.038408918513455834
"Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records Project Summary A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr.Ozrazgat Baslanti, with the necessary protected time and additional training and resources to develop her skillset on quantitative methods and understanding of underlying mechanism of progression of kidney disease and facilitate her transition to an independent translational researcher in health care. The long-term career goal is to become an independent data scientist, with a focus on hospital care for acute disease and complications arising from that care. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of the analytical approach for identifying patients’ health trajectories during episode of acute hospitalization and quantifying the transitions in health states that can be applied to any acute illness. Our central hypothesis is that using kidney health as a paradigm for this approach we can determine individual states of change in kidney health during hospitalization using longitudinal, highly granular temporal data in electronic health records, determine transition probabilities to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease, and improve understanding of the underlying processes influencing these transitions. Current diagnosis and risk evaluation for acute kidney injury (AKI) are focused on determination of severity of AKI episode and an integrated framework for assessing renal recovery does not exist. There is a clear lack of research on estimating transition probabilities among different states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using longitudinal electronic health records data. The complexity of underlying processes influencing the transition probabilities from renal risk to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease requires application of advanced computational models in sufficiently large and granular datasets. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1- Expand and validate computable phenotypes of kidney health in large-scale medical data. Aim 2- Determine the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of changes in kidney health. Aim 3- Develop and validate probabilistic graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health and identify risk factors for progression. The proposed research is significant as we will have phenotyping algorithms of kidney health, validated in multi-center study, that can enhance their inter-institutional sharing and that enable to study epidemiology and outcomes of changes in kidney health. The approach is innovative because it implements technological advances in data science and statistics in innovative steps to develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm that determines computable phenotypes of changes in kidney health and graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using highly granular electronic health records. This will provide foundation for changes in the care of patients with AKI, through identification of those patients at risk of developing AKI and progressing to acute and chronic kidney disease. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and a diagnosis and prognostication tool for kidney health. Project Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complication among hospitalized patients and is central to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Besides the severity of an initial episode of acute kidney injury, the timing and duration of renal recovery are required to characterize the natural history of this complex condition and its effect on overall kidney health. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health, since our research may provide diagnosis and prediction tools for changes in kidney health using electronic records data that contain wealth of clinical data that could be used to identify all dimensions of AKI episode as well as key determinants of undesired outcomes.",Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records,9891542,K01DK120784,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Network', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Preventive therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adjudication', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'computable phenotypes', 'data warehouse', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prognostic tool', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2020,130488,0.04385909063776002
"Skeletal Myopathy in Systemic Sclerosis: Devising a Classification Schema Predictive of Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY Skeletal myopathy in systemic sclerosis (SSc) is associated with increased disability and mortality. There is no consensus classification of SSc-associated myopathy that can be utilized to lay the groundwork for understanding muscle disease in scleroderma. We know that there is pathological, serological, and outcome heterogeneity that may be informative in defining distinct subsets of myopathy in SSc. Our preliminary data demonstrate that (1) muscle histopathology is heterogeneous in SSc, (2) patients with a fibrosing myopathy have poor outcomes, in particular cardiac death, and (3) there is intense signal uptake on advanced MRI imaging such as diffusion weighted and tensor imaging and T2 mapping in SSc-associated myopathy which may indicate early disease related changes when compared to conventional muscle MRI. This K23 proposal will first establish a Myopathy cohort (Aim 1), devise a classification schema and test its utility in predicting long term outcomes such as trajectory, cardiopulmonary disease, disability, mortality, and treatment responsiveness(Aim 2), and detect and quantify early disease related muscle changes on advanced muscle MRI (Aim 3). This application is for a K23 award for Julie Paik, MD, MHS, Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology at the Johns Hopkins University. Her long term career goal is to become a leading clinical investigator in scleroderma muscle disease in the context of observational cohort studies, state of the art imaging biomarkers, and clinical trial methodology. Her short term goal of devising this classification schema will provide a new gold standard for the validation of external myopathy cohorts in SSc and lay the framework for future studies directed at understanding biological mechanism and developing a therapeutic trial using measurable outcomes such as quantitative muscle MRI. This proposal takes advantage of the rich resources and infrastructure at the Johns Hopkins Scleroderma Center, a recently designated Precision Center of Excellence in 2018. Her mentoring team includes Dr. Laura Hummers and Dr. Fredrick Wigley, both renowned experts in SSc and clinical epidemiology, Dr. Andrew Mammen is an internationally recognized myositis expert, and Dr. Scott Zeger a leader in bio statistical and epidemiological research. Dr. Paik has recruited vital members to her Advisory Committee, composed of mentors and collaborators who have specific expertise relevant to the proposal and are fully supportive of Dr. Paik’s research and career goals. These include Dr. Michael Jacobs (advanced radiological imaging), Dr. Laura Fayad (musculoskeletal radiology), Dr. Andrea Corse (muscle histopathology), Dr. Tom Lloyd (classification schemas in inclusion body myositis), and Dr. Ami Shah (scleroderma translational research). This K23 award will allow Dr. Paik to gain the skills needed to analyze and develop a classification schema of skeletal myopathy in scleroderma, develop expertise in advanced muscle MRI analysis, and build her clinical trial skill set to ultimately support a future R01 proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will establish a comprehensive, prospective myopathy cohort in systemic sclerosis (SSc or scleroderma) to ultimately devise a novel classification schema for SSc-associated myopathy that is predictive of outcomes such as treatment response, disability, cardiopulmonary disease trajectory, and death. Advanced muscle MRI techniques include diffusion weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and T2 mapping will also be used to detect and quantify early muscle disease related changes in SSc associated myopathy.

"Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study Project Summary/Abstract The developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood is marked by a mix of potential and vulnerability. A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during this critical period, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and the first signs of emotional disorders. It is important to understand detailed patterns of typical development, so alterations can be identified and rectified as early as possible. As an entirely noninvasive and quantitative imaging method, arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for functional brain development in both healthy populations and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, there remain significant challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying neurodevelopment, including: 1) a coarse spatial resolution of ~4x4x4mm3, 2) susceptibility to head motion with segmented 3D acquisitions, and 3) potential confounding effects of age dependent variations in arterial transit time using a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan. Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) or multiband (MB) is a new accelerated imaging technology that simultaneously excites multiple slices and recovers each slice with parallel imaging techniques. Preliminary studies combining MB with ASL showed that MB can reduce T1 relaxation of the label, improve spatial coverage and/or resolution compared to those of standard 2D ASL. MB imaging may also overcome the limitation of 3D ASL acquisitions in terms of head motion and spatial blurring. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing MB ASL is inferior to that of 3D ASL. This project builds on two recent innovations from our lab: 1) a constrained slice-dependent (CSD) background suppression (BS) technique that improves the SNR of 2D MB pCASL to be comparable to that of 3D pCASL; and 2) a single-shot 3D GRASE pCASL method with 2D CAIPIRINHA accelerations that improves the imaging speed of 3D pCASL. The goal of this R01 project is to develop and evaluate cutting-edge MB pCASL protocols that are able to offer a high spatial resolution of isotropic 2mm or higher, resistance to head motion and multi-delay capability for accurate perfusion quantification in pediatric populations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoising algorithm for multi-delay MB pCASL will be further developed. The developed suite of MB pCASL protocol and post- processing algorithms will be evaluated in 40 typically developing children and adolescents. The successful completion of this R01 project will lead to a robust multi-delay MB pCASL protocol that is highly valuable as potential biomarker for both neurodevelopment research and pediatric clinical care. To maximize the scientific and clinical impact, we will continue disseminating the pulse sequence and associated post-processing software as we have been doing in the past decade. Relevance to Public Health A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during the developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and emotional disorders.

"Development and Dissemination of Clinical CEST MRI Acquisition and Analysis Methods for Cancer Imaging Applications This research plan will continue our development of Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI acquisition and analysis methods for imaging patients with cancer. AcidoCEST MRI with an exogenous contrast agent is an innovative variation of this technique that measures extracellular pH in solid tumors. We have also developed an exceptionally innovative method that acquires endogenous CEST MR images with multiple powers, which can measure the chemical exchange rate of endogenous proteins that can assess relative differences in pH. We will improve our CEST MRI acquisition methods by accelerating the imaging speed, reducing and eliminating complications due to patient motion, eliminating complications caused by fat signal, and expanding to 3D imaging methods. We will also improve image analysis methods that are required for CEST contrast from endogenous proteins and exogenous contrast agents.  Our research has strong impact because acidoCEST MRI can track changes in tumor acidosis in response to chemotherapy and chemoradiation therapy in patients who have breast cancer and head & neck cancer. Endogenous CEST MRI can improve the diagnoses of brain tumor recurrence vs. pseudoprogression, and evaluations of lung cancer vs. lung infection. We will perform clinical studies with our endogenous and exogenous CEST MRI methods to image patients with brain, breast, lung, and head & neck cancers.  To amplify the impact of our research, we will develop versions of our CEST MRI acquisition methods for the many versions of the 13 Siemens hardware platforms and software operating systems at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. We will also develop user-friendly CEST analysis methods for many researchers at MD Anderson. We will leverage our unique research environment and expertise with intra-institutional dissemination to provide inter-institutional dissemination, by sharing share these acquisition and analysis tools with other CEST MRI researchers. We will collaborate with NIST to provide the first CEST MRI phantom that can standardize the development and implementation of intra- and inter-institutional CEST MRI methods.  Our team of outstanding investigators includes experts in CEST saturation methods, CEST MR image analysis, clinical contrast agents, rapid MRI acquisition methods, high field 7T MRI, clinical radiology, biostatistics, histopathology and oncology. Based on our expertise and years of productivity in clinical CEST MRI, we have developed an exceptional research approach. As the world's largest cancer center and a health destination, the MD Anderson Cancer Center has the patient population that provides very strong institutional support for our clinical studies.

"Serial evaluation of cardioprotective effects of exercise training in heart failure using cardiac diffusion tensor MRI Project Summary / Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is accounts for 1 in 9 deaths in the United States and currently affects ~6 million with a prevalence of 250,00-400,000 and incidence of 70,000-120,000. Current therapy does not address the underlying loss of functional heart muscle and adverse structural remodeling. One novel potential treatment of HF is exercise (aerobic) therapy that has demonstrated various cardioprotective properties to halt and potentially reverse adverse structural remodeling. However, dosing of exercise therapy remains a challenge due to each individual's inherent differences and consequentially, serial non-invasive monitoring of the therapy would be necessary to evaluate the change on structural remodeling. Furthermore, current non-invasive technologies characterize structural remodeling with surrogate measures and thus, there is no consensus on a single clinical gold-standard. Without a tool to monitor and characterize the degree of structural remodeling, the evaluation of the therapeutic potential of exercise therapy in HF patients cannot be fully realized representing an unmet need in ultimately improving therapy. The proposed project aims to improve the therapy monitoring of exercise training to cardioprotect against HF by revealing its effect on microstructural remodeling with cardiac diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI). DT-MRI is a unique, non-invasive technology capable of characterizing myocardial fiber orientation and directly reflecting microstructural remodeling. However, despite major advances, there are fundamental challenges that limit the capability of current cardiac DT-MRI methods to be applied robustly in a clinical setting. In this project, an innovative 5-min “push button” DT-MRI method will be developed that overcomes such limitations. We also leverage institutional strengths to further quantify the accuracy of in vivo DT-MRI in revealing myocardial microstructure using novel tissue cleared 3D histology. The central hypothesis is that addressing these major technical challenges will allow for clinical translation of cardiac DT-MRI to serve as a tool to monitor the therapeutic effects of HF on microstructural remodeling. This is achieved by extending previously developed technologies used for myocardial fibrosis detection with diffusion-weighted MRI. The proposed project is designed to systematically develop an innovative and robust clinical DT-MRI methodology and rigorously validate in a pre-clinical setting the effects of exercise therapy on the microstructural remodeling of HF thereby laying the groundwork for potential optimization of dosing exercise therapy. Project Narrative This project ultimately aims at optimizing the non-invasive monitoring of exercise therapy in heart failure patients to potentially improve outcome. The research strategy is designed to systematically develop an innovative cardiac diffusion tensor MRI method that overcomes major shortcomings of the conventional methods and aims at immediate clinical translation. Successful completion of this project will result in a clinically robust cardiac diffusion tensor MRI method that can effectively monitor the efficacy of exercise therapy and potentially improve treatment of heart failure.",Serial evaluation of cardioprotective effects of exercise training in heart failure using cardiac diffusion tensor MRI,9946164,R01HL151704,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Aerobic', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Exhibits', 'Family suidae', 'Fiber', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Histology', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Pacemakers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevalence', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'RNA marker', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Pathway', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Tachycardia', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'cardioprotection', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'cohort', 'coronary fibrosis', 'denoising deep learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exercise training', 'functional loss', 'heart function', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'preservation', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'reconstruction', 'sedentary', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,673600,0.013514789901342436
"Accurate quantification of kidney function with non-sedated motion-compensated pediatric MRI Project Summary: Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is an impairment of urine flow from the renal pelvis into the proximal ureter and is the most common cause of hydronephrosis in neonates. This disorder is detected in up to 7% of all maternal ultrasound scans, and an estimated 10% of these newborns have hydronephrosis, which, if left untreated, may result in early failure of functional renal development in these patients. Current methods of assessing kidney function in neonates and children are less than optimal, however. While the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3), yields some useful diagnostic information; it is invasive, slow, provides low resolution, does not offer anatomic detail, and delivers potentially harmful ionizing radiation. Thus, there is an urgent, unmet need to develop a method for functional imaging of kidneys that is non-invasive, safe, accurate, reproducible and radiation-free. The primary objective of this exploratory, two-year study, therefore, is two-fold: first, to develop advanced methods of motion-compensated, high spatial and temporal resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the improved quantification of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), an important marker of renal function; and second, to demonstrate the superiority of this method over the current reference standard, nuclear renography (MAG3). Our application in response to PAR-18-743 is specifically aimed at developing, and evaluating motion-robust, high spatiotemporal resolution dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) for quantifying GFR (MR-GFR) as well as creating new automated analysis software to enable the robust and reproducible assessment of differential renal function in newborns eliminating need for sedation, and in older children. Our method will overcome the technical challenges of current DCE-MRI techniques providing high temporal resolution to capture fast arterial input function dynamics required for accurate computation of GFR, compensate for unavoidable respiratory and bulk motion to reconstruct high quality images and will provide robust, fast, automated post processing techniques for accurate GFR computation. As a non-invasive, motion-robust, radiation-free imaging technique that can depict renal structures at much higher resolution, MR-GFR will offer, for the first time, a level of diagnostic information that is unattainable with MAG3. The critical importance of understanding the extent and severity of UPJO (and resulting hydronephrosis) cannot be understated; for in the absence of this information, children who stand to benefit from immediate surgery might be overlooked or delayed in receiving treatment; and those who might benefit from a more conservative approach (i.e., watching waiting) might receive an unnecessary surgical intervention. Indeed, this novel imaging approach is expected to substantially improve clinical decision-making. The successful completion of our aims will enable 1) assessment of renal function accurately; 2) predicting the likelihood of functional decline; and 3) determining whether surgery is indicated. DCE-MRI is expected to have rapid translational impact for several diseases effecting kidney function once it is introduced into clinical practice. Project Narrative: This project addresses the need to develop advanced methods of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess kidney function in newborns and in older children who have been diagnosed with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), an impairment of urine flow that is the most common cause of hydronephrosis (inability to void urine). Unfortunately, severe hydronephrosis, left untreated, can result in permanent damage to the child's kidneys and our novel method of assessing kidney function, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), promises to evaluate the extent of this disorder in a way that is highly accurate, non- invasive, safe, reliable, and radiation-free and will eliminate the need of repeated scans, sedation and anesthesia when imaging newborns with congenital hydronephrosis. Most importantly, this approach will enable the clinician to confidently and quickly refer children for corrective surgery based on imaging results; and likewise, recommend other children for more conservative “watchful-waiting”, effectively reducing the number of unnecessary surgeries.",Accurate quantification of kidney function with non-sedated motion-compensated pediatric MRI,9877232,R21DK123569,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age-Months', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drainage procedure', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Free Will', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gadolinium', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Hospitalization', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Infection', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Liquid substance', 'Lower urinary tract', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Nephrectomy', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nuclear', 'Obstruction', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pain', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pentetic Acid', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Reference Standards', 'Renal function', 'Renal pelvis', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sedation procedure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Ureter', 'Ureteropelvic junction obstruction', 'Urine', 'Urology', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bulk motion', 'care costs', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep neural network', 'functional decline', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney imaging', 'kinetic model', 'neonate', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'renal artery', 'respiratory', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'translational impact', 'urologic']",NIDDK,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,221250,0.05064201035336252
"Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization Project Summary: Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization A recent White House initiative titled Advancing American Kidney Health outlines the current administration's plans to increase the supply of kidneys in the US, along with other measures that attempt to correct the imbalance between supply and demand for kidneys. In alignment with this White House initiative, the principal investigator (PI) of this project will develop algorithms to assist Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) make donor disposition decisions with the goal of increasing the supply of transplantable organs. The PI will harness the vast amount of data collected by OPOs, and customize as well as develop new Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify good donors. These algorithms will reduce case coordinators workload and improve the accuracy of their decisions. The PI's objective is to quantity the impact of AI-assisted decision-making on increasing the supply of kidneys by ﬁnding missed opportunities on account of the current manual processes. Even a few more potential donors per OPO will help reduce the organ shortage problem when scaled to all 58 OPOs across the country.  This project will leverage unique data sets to generate and test hypotheses concerning which fac- tors aﬀect donor disposition decisions, and which information processing protocols produce greater referral-to-donor conversion rate. It will also customize classiﬁcation algorithms to assist case co- ordinators make donor disposition decisions. The focus will be on improving both the accuracy and speed of such decisions. As a follow up of this project, the PI will conduct a broader study involving at least ﬁve additional OPOs. The ﬁve OPOs will be selected to represent the diversity in size, population, and geography among the 58 OPOs across the country. Results of this and the follow-up study will be shared freely with all OPOs. The proposed research has the potential to increase the number of donors, free up staﬀ time, and lower OPO labor costs.  The potential impact of this project lies in the formulation and testing of hypotheses that can beneﬁt OPO decision-making and people on transplant wait list, customization of existing machine learning algorithms and computational techniques for sequential decision-making in a novel setting, and laying the groundwork for the development of new methods in the future.  The PI has the necessary disciplinary expertise, and management and leadership experience to succeed in the proposed eﬀorts. He has access to advanced computing resources and administrative help from the University of Texas. Finally, he has obtained the necessary IRB approval to proceed with this project. 1 Project Narrative: Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization The widespread use of electronic medical record systems by hospitals, and electronic capture of referrals data by the organ procurement organizations (OPOs) makes it possible to harness large amounts of data to augment human decision-making and ask whether this can increase the supply of organs, speciﬁcally kidneys. The PI in this project will focus on improving the speed and accuracy of case coordinators' donor-disposition decisions by developing and testing customized machine learning and sequential decision-making algorithms using data from two OPOs. These eﬀorts will help quantify the potential beneﬁt of leveraging OPO data to increase kidney supply and pave the way for a larger study focusing on multiple OPOs.",Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization,10042096,R03HS027671,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2020,41981,0.018672579491812974
"Risk Assessment of Cerebral Aneurysm Growth with 4D flow MRI PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to determine the contribution of hemodynamic factors to risk assessment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) and calculate these factors from enhanced in vivo 4D flow MRI data. Even though most UIAs are stable, the majority of UIA patients are offered interventional treatment due to the grave risk presented if an aneurysm ruptures. Previous studies indicated that in addition to clinical (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities) and morphological (e.g., location and size) factors, UIA progression is affected by local blood flow dynamics. Hemodynamic factors associated with UIA growth can be obtained from computational and experimental models or from 4D flow MRI measurements; however, each approach has limitations. The previous NIH-funded project focused on developing image-based computational methods for predicting postoperative flow following interventions. The goal of this renewal is to use the developed framework to improve risk stratification of UIAs using image-based flow analysis. The proposed project will develop multi-parametric predictive models that combine clinical and morphological factors with hemodynamic factors calculated from augmented 4D flow MRI data. The UIA growth predicted by different models will be compared to outcomes observed in longitudinal imaging studies. The aims of the proposed project are, therefore, to: (1) determine the probability of UIA growth by utilizing morphological and clinical factors together with hemodynamic factors obtained from computational and experimental flow models by a) performing statistical analysis based on morphological and clinical factors obtained from longitudinal imaging, and b) extending statistical model by including hemodynamic factors computed from patient-specific models; (2) Enhance 4D flow MRI data by a) determining 4D flow reproducibility and variability with in vitro studies, and b) applying advanced data augmentation methods to improve the accuracy of calculated hemodynamic factors affecting aneurysm growth; (3) determine the probability of UIA growth based on multi-parametric analysis utilizing hemodynamic factors calculated from enhanced 4D flow MRI. Successful completion of the project will resolve the controversy regarding how hemodynamic factors affect aneurysm growth and establish 4D flow MRI as a diagnostic tool for UIA risk stratification. This collaborative project engages the cardiovascular engineering group at Purdue University and neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists and MRI physicists at Northwestern University, University of California San Francisco and Barrow Neurological Institute. This cross-disciplinary team will bring together experts in neurovascular surgeries, MRI velocimetry, patient-specific flow computations, experimental fluid mechanics and statistical analysis. Retrospective and prospective UIAs data obtained from these superb clinical centers will be used in this study. The outstanding engineering resources available at Purdue and world-class imaging resources at Northwestern, UC San Francisco and Barrow, as well as existing the data sharing agreements between these institutions and ongoing collaborations between the PIs, will ensure the project's success. PROJECT NARRATIVE The majority of brain aneurysms are treated, despite the fact that most of them have very low risk or rupture. Studies indicated that brain aneurysm risk factors include a range of clinical (e.g., patient’s age, sex, family history) and anatomical (e.g., aneurysm location, size and shape) parameters, as well as local blood flow dynamics. The proposed studies will determine the specific contribution of blood flow variables for improving the risk assessment of brain aneurysms and examine whether these variables can be reliably calculated from flow velocities measured with phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging.",Risk Assessment of Cerebral Aneurysm Growth with 4D flow MRI,10052679,R01HL115267,"['4D MRI', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Angiography', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Aneurysms', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cerebral Aneurysm', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Postoperative Period', 'Probability', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'San Francisco', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Velocimetries', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical center', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'data sharing', 'enhancing factor', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neurovascular', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'residence', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'shear stress', 'success', 'tool']",NHLBI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,707635,0.018419700836442735
"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,9850978,R01EB016695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,569563,0.012242823039784249
"Enabling the Next Generation of High Performance Pediatric Whole Body MR Imaging Project Abstract Motivation: We aim to develop and implement a new approach to transform pediatric MRI. The ultimate goal is ultra-fast and motion-robust imaging in a dedicated child-friendly environment to enable more children undergo MRI without anesthesia. For those who still require anesthesia, it will be briefer and lighter, and performed in a safer environment. This project leverages a small compact magnet, designed for adult brain MRI, with gradients that enable very fast imaging. With this magnet as an outstanding starting point, we will tailor our deep experience and multiple successes in developing new MRI approaches to high-density receiver coils, fast imaging sequences, and new image reconstruction methods to set a new standard for pediatric MRI. Approach: Although the compact scanner is designed for adult heads, with a 37 cm inner diameter, it can accommodate children under eight to ten years of age to image any body part. To transform this system for ideal pediatric scanning, three development aims will be pursued. The ﬁrst is to enable optimal signal reception. This will be accomplished through creating new receive chain electronics that are matched to the gradient capabilities, for ultra-high bandwidth imaging. This will be coupled to very thin and formed receive arrays that maximize the size of the patient that can be accommodated in the small bore of the scanner. The second aim is to develop methods of obtaining the highest performance out of the system by characterizing and correcting for its imperfections. This will be coupled to a bespoke approach to peripheral nerve stimulation, enabling maximal use of the gradients on each patient. These two developments will then be leveraged for high efﬁciency and motion robust noncartesian scanning. The ﬁnal aim is to develop a full environment and infrastructure that is well suited to pediatric imaging. Patient preparation and acclimation to MRI will be enhanced by virtual reality. Support equipment for anesthesia, new physiological sensors, and a novel child-friendly audiovisual system will be created. Signiﬁcance: The result of this project will be a revolutionary change in the way that MRI is used and per- formed for children. MRI will be more available, cheaper, safer, and have markedly improved image quality. Project Narrative We will leverage the outstanding magnet and gradients of a unique small bore MRI scanner to create a new standard for unprecedented whole-body pediatric MR imaging. We will develop, integrate, and validate a set of technologies speciﬁcally for pediatric imaging. These include ultra-high bandwidth MRI signal reception from thin form-ﬁtting hardware, high-speed image data acquisition and image reconstruction, and environmental support appropriate for children.",Enabling the Next Generation of High Performance Pediatric Whole Body MR Imaging,9944392,U01EB029427,"['10 year old', '8 year old', 'Acclimatization', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cone', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Flare', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Immersion', 'Infrastructure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Nerve Stimulation', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Support System', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Vendor', 'base', 'commercialization', 'contrast imaging', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pediatric patients', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual reality', 'whole body imaging']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,887058,0.044178580176302946
"Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children Progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in childhood is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic bone disease, and death. Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), including posterior urethral valves, account for 50-60% of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children and are the most common cause of ESRD in this age group. In children with CAKUT, kidney injury is often already established at birth due to renal dysplasia. Some children, however, maintain preserved kidney function into adulthood while others progress to ESRD in childhood. Our ability to effectively implement therapies to slow CKD progression is limited by our lack of understanding of which patients are at greatest risk for CKD progression and therefore would be most likely to benefit from early intervention. Thus there is a need for biomarkers that can identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression. To identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression, we will develop novel computational methods to derive clinically informative biomarkers from ultrasound (US) imaging data using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and effectively integrate them with established clinical measures for early prediction of CKD progression. To achieve reliable and accurate kidney segmentation, Aim 1 develops an automatic kidney segmentation method by adopting fully CNNs, conditional random fields, and active contour models to simultaneously learn informative high-level image features and inter-voxel relationship under shape regularizations to improve the segmentation accuracy and robustness to imaging noise. To achieve improved prediction of CDK progression based on US imaging data, deep CNNs will be adopted to learn informative imaging features in a multi-instance learning framework to predict which children with CAKUT will develop CKD progression and their timing of progression in Aim 2. These techniques will be applied to a dataset of patients followed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, in order to derive individualized predictive indices of CKD progression. The proposed new techniques will allow us to early differentiate patients with distinct disease progression patterns.

"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia. After considerable progress reducing the depth and duration of anes- thesia, this work aims to reduce the frequency of anesthesia through a synergistic combination of fast, quiet, motion-robust, automated, and adaptive scanning. This will make MRI safer, cheaper, and more widely available to children, reducing the population risk of radiation from CT.",Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI,9927622,R01EB009690,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body part', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Breathing', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'community setting', 'compliance behavior', 'contrast enhanced', 'data quality', 'design and construction', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient tolerability', 'pediatric patients', 'programs', 'radiation risk', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,664041,0.05025667689630807
"Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract The applicant Udo Hoffmann MD MPH is a Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and the Chief of the Division for Cardiovascular Imaging in the Department of Radiology at MGH. Dr. Hoffmann has established a patient oriented research (POR) program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research methods to demonstrate the value of advanced cardiovascular imaging. Dr. Hoffmann has published approximately 380 peer reviewed papers, among them many in premier medical journals and has received continued independent, peer-reviewed POR NIH funding since 2005. He is among the very few faculty members at Harvard Medical School who are both the PI and Director of a highly successful NHLBI funded T- 32 program (Cardiac MR and CT Research) and a recipient of a K24. Dr. Hoffmann has successfully mentored more than 60 clinical investigators, most of which currently hold faculty positions in major academic centers and actively perform POR. Moreover, Dr. Hoffmann has successfully accomplished all mentoring and scientific goals of the first K24 award period. Overall, these achievements document Dr. Hoffmann's long standing passion and commitment to POR. His excellent publication, funding, and mentoring record together with his current and planned research support provide an excellent foundation to accomplish the aims of this competitive renewal of the K24 Award “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. Dr. Hoffmann proposes a mentoring and research plan that utilizes the synergies of past, ongoing, and future highly innovative independent research projects with educational and training opportunities offered by the cardiac MR CT PET Program, the T32 training program in cardiovascular imaging, the Harvard CTSA, and the Harvard School of Public Health. The specific aims addressing the charge of the K24 Award are to enable Dr. Hoffmann to: 1) dedicate 25% of his time to mentor clinical investigators based on NIH or equivalent funded projects in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”, 2) to mentor junior and mid-career clinical investigators with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants, and 3) to continue to expand a POR program that combines translational, clinical, and outcomes research to develop future leaders in clinical research in cardiovascular imaging and beyond. The research plan encompasses four specific aims: 1) To determine the effects of statin treatment on coronary atherosclerosis in HIV patients in 800 patients with HIV randomized to statin therapy vs. placebo, 2) To determine whether high risk coronary plaque predicts cardiovascular events in 4600 patients with clinical suspicion of CAD, 3) To determine the cost effectiveness of CT FFR in patients with stable and acute chest pain, and 4) To use Radiomics to identify novel imaging markers predicting cardiovascular events in participants of the Framingham Heart Study.

"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Total kidney volume (TKV) has become the main image-based biomarker for following ADPKD progression. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming and costly.
