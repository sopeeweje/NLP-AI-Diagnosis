"SCH: INT: VOLI: Voice Assistant for Quality of Life and Healthcare Improvement in Aging Populations   According to the latest US Census Bureau predictions, by 2035 older people are projected to outnumber children for the first time in US history. This brings significant societal challenges based on their unique living and health-related conditions stemming from reduced sensory, motor, and cognitive capabilities, as wen as multiple chronic conditions. We propose a personalized and context-aware voice-based digital assistant to improve the quality of life and the healthcare of older adults. VOLI will leverage the growing capabilities of existing technologies, such as mobile devices and smart speakers, and go well beyond the basics of weather reports, news services, and simple games, to provide more complex voice-based services and to focus on the healthcare domain with its many challenges and constraints. We will pursue three parallel research aims: 1) Our technical aim will investigate how digital assistants, natural language processing, and machine learning can produce meaningful health-related conversations by leveraging population- and patient-level data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs); 2) Our social, behavioral, and cognitive aim will focus on designing services for older adults based on their needs to support independence and investigate the acceptability of digital assistants for the aging population; and 3) Our clinical aim will investigate how digital assistants can detect new symptoms and correlate them with medication side effects and interactions, worsening of existing conditions, or onset of new illnesses. Using our VOLI voice-assistant, older adults will be able to get medication reminders and instructions based on prescriptions and clinical notes from EHRs, notify their family/caregiver about their well-being status, interact with their healthcare provider, request an Uber/Lyft car or other third-party services, engage in cognitive games, report symptoms as they occur throughout the day and over the counter medications they are taking, ask questions about symptoms and medications, and so on. VOLi integrates information from EHRs, clinical ontologies, and patient-level terminology. This work will be supported by innovations in natural language understanding, deep learning, and human-computer interfaces. Our work is guided by both clinicians and researchers in human-centered computing. Our team has a history of successful interdisciplinary work in healthcare, expert systems in clinical care, EHR integration, patient monitoring and self-report, ubiquitous computing, data analytics, and field studies. This research directly supports the mission of NIA by addressing the needs of older adults to be independent in their homes and to optimize their healthcare based on the context of their symptoms and medications. VOLI will also reduce caregiving burden and optimize the interactions with healthcare and service providers. The research can be extended to monitor recovery after surgery and reduce length of stay in the hospital, identify onset of new illness, or Identify when to refer a patient to hospice.",SCH: INT: VOLI: Voice Assistant for Quality of Life and Healthcare Improvement in Aging Populations  ,10017366,R56AG067393,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data Analytics', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Expert Systems', 'Family Caregiver', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Instruction', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Time', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Voice', 'Weather', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'care giving burden', 'clinical care', 'deep learning', 'design', 'electronic data', 'field study', 'handheld mobile device', 'hospice environment', 'human centered computing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent personal assistant', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'news', 'postoperative recovery', 'service providers', 'side effect', 'social', 'stem', 'ubiquitous computing']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R56,2019,299957,0.08454665403510318
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing,9739350,R01AG055337,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Anesthetics', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Records', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Perioperative', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peer', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2019,426737,0.06807730693189654
"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this application is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smart phones, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to perform health assessment and detection of health events (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to support sustainable improvement of brain health (Aim 3). Finally, we train machine learning algorithms from the clinical observations to automate assessment of health and intervention impact (Aim 4). The use of these technologies is expected to improve and extend the functional health and wellbeing of older adults, lead to more proactive and preventative health care, and reduce the caregiver burden of health monitoring and assistance. By understanding situational factors that impact prompt adherence, adherence situations can be increased. The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new machine learning techniques for activity learning and health assessment based on clinical ground truth. These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home technology to automatically identify health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smart home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions,9693819,R01NR016732,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Financial Hardship', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Nursing', 'Research', 'Self Management', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Work', 'aging in place', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain health', 'care costs', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'design', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health care delivery', 'health management', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'personalized intervention', 'physical conditioning', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'smart home', 'social', 'technology validation', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'usability']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,356218,0.07325099120903916
"Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging Project Summary. Among older adults, sudden and unexpected financial losses as a result of fraud can have devastating consequences. A rapidly aging population, combined with age-related changes in decision-making processes, means that fraudulent activities targeting older adults is a growing public health problem that requires surveillance, education, and intervention. Motivated by theories of cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological aging, this proposal investigates behavioral and neural decision-making mechanisms associated with fraud risk in older adulthood. In a more globally connected and computerized world, older adults may constitute particular at-risk targets for highly effective forms of online financial fraud, such as through social engineering in the form of emails containing malicious links or attachments (phishing). Susceptibility to financial deception in aging has been investigated primarily in the context of age-related cognitive decline, while socioemotional and neurophysiological parameters have been largely understudied. Further, there are few effective approaches to characterize, monitor and detect, and eventually prevent, financial deception. The objectives of the proposed research are threefold: Aim 1 will determine financial deception risk across the adult life span. This aim will seek to confirm that age is associated with greater susceptibility to financial deception, online and in person. Aim 2 will characterize cognitive, socioemotional, and neurophysiological mechanisms associated with deception risk. Specifically, this aim will uncover the extent to which cognitive and socioemotional dysfunction, age-related dampening in neurophysiological reactivity, and structural and functional brain changes contribute to increased susceptibility in aging. Aim 3 involves the development and psychometric validation of a novel risk assessment interview and the development of an automated deception warning tool to alert older adults about potential online fraud. Our research design will span three data collection phases comprising healthy young, middle-aged, young-old, and old-old individuals. Leveraging infrastructure developed in our lab, a behavioral field experiment will determine real-life susceptibility to financial fraud via simulated phishing email attacks (Phase I). A comprehensive in-lab assessment of cognitive/socioemotional and neurophysiological mechanisms will follow (Phase II and III, respectively). A data-analytic Phase IV will integrate data collected across Phases I-III using statistical and machine-learning methods. This multidisciplinary approach, encompassing psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and engineering will lay the foundation for building an integrated approach to risk detection and the provision of financial decision-making supports in older adulthood. Findings and methodologies developed as part of this project have the potential to inform real-life decision-supportive interventions that adopt an age-targeted approach towards the long-term goal of financial risk reduction in older individuals. Project Narrative A rapidly aging population means that financial deception of the aged is an emerging public health problem that requires surveillance and intervention. An increasingly common form of financial fraud is conducted online as older adults more and more manage their assets online. The project goal is to determine cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological risk factors for financial deception in older adults and validate risk assessment and develop detection tools toward a long-term goal of identifying individuals who are particularly susceptible to financial fraud and facilitating prevention and decision-supportive intervention efforts.",Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging,9766171,R01AG057764,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'American', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Deception', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Educational Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Foundations', 'Fraud', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Structure', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Transact', 'Validation', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cyber security', 'decision-making capacity', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'financial decision making', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'learning strategy', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'phishing', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2019,322824,0.16381434974478587
"Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] needed for older adults to maintain optimal physical function is unknown. Institute of Medicine and Endocrine Society have publicly debated on 20 ng/mL or 30 ng/mL, respectively, as targets for skeletal health, but both groups agree that stronger evidence is needed to identify target concentrations for extra-skeletal outcomes, e.g., falls and physical function. The problem is significant: >25% of older adults have poor physical function, 50% have 25(OH)D concentrations between 20 and 30 ng/mL. Identifying 25(OH)D targets for older adults will have immediate impact by informing design and analysis of vitamin D supplementation trials. Namely, targets serve as inclusion/exclusion criteria or baseline subgroups and as secondary outcomes. Our solution is to empirically identify and validate sex-specific (possibly stratified by other factors; e.g., race, genetic variants) 25(OH)D targets in older adults (= 65 years) related to lowe risk of falls and better physical function using existing NIH-funded datasets. A critical challenge is that 25(OH)D cannot be randomized; therefore observational data are a crucial part of the solution. Conventional statistical methods are ill-equipped for this problem; thus, we will develop novel statistical methods by adapting and refining structural modeling and machine-learning methods, and apply them to our aims. We will carry out the aims using 4 prospective cohort studies comprising >12,500 older adults: Health, Aging, and Body Composition, Invecchiare in Chianti, Osteoporotic Fractures in Men, and Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. We will: 1) identify and validate 25(OH)D targets for falls reduction, mobility, activities of daily living, and instrumental activities of daily living (functional outcomes); and gait speed, muscle strength, and frailty (proximal conditions) (aim 1); 2) characterize the joint impact of 25(OH)D and serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations on functional outcomes/proximal conditions (aim 2); and 3) quantify mediation of 25(OH)D on functional outcomes/proximal conditions by endocrine and metabolic factors (PTH, serum alkaline phosphatase, aklotho, fibroblast growth factor 23) (aim 3). We will write code in SAS and R statistical languages and disseminate it to the scientific community for use in additional research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aging of the population is expected to lead to an increased burden of poor physical function and loss of independence. Low concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] are common in older adults and may be one reason for deficits in physical function. Since 25(OH)D can easily be increased by sunlight exposure, diet, and supplements; identifying and validating a target 25(OH)D for functional outcomes in older adults can have a significant impact on public health.",Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults,9701092,R01AG048069,"['25-hydroxyvitamin D', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Body mass index', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Elderly', 'Endocrine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gait speed', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Living', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intake', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'PTH gene', 'Phosphorus', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Sun Exposure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D supplementation', 'Woman', 'Writing', 'analytical method', 'bone', 'bone health', 'calcium intake', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic variant', 'improved mobility', 'inclusion criteria', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sarcopenia', 'secondary analysis', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'skeletal', 'ultraviolet']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2019,320457,0.12305412919844659

"Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease Resubmission 1 R01 AG058687-01 PI: Adriana Seelye, Ph.D. Project Summary. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease and their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and to reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. Project Objectives. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to objectively assess high-level IADL functioning in a new way that will more effectively identify the earliest subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence. The specific aims for this research are: Aim 1 will establish the most robust remotely monitored IADL variables and combinations of variables to discriminate between MCI and intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC using cross-sectional analyses. Aim 2 will determine the discriminatory ability of the new remotely monitored IADL variables compared to available IADL questionnaires to differentiate those with MCI relative to those with intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC in cross-sectional analyses. Aim 3 will identify and characterize the longitudinal trajectories (slopes) of remotely monitored IADL functioning over time between those with intact cognition and those with MCI using generalized linear mixed effects models, with person-specific IADL distributions and their changes as outcomes. Project Methods. The proposed project will apply innovative computing and ambient sensing technologies directly in participants' home and community environments to objectively assess IADL performance and variability among older adults with and without MCI in multiple clinically relevant functional domains for up to 4 years. Study involvement will also include annual neuropsychological and clinical testing. Machine learning computational approaches will be used to examine a large number of sensor-based IADL candidate variables generated through this study to determine the relative importance of these variables for discriminating between MCI and intact cognition groups, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Project Impact. The approaches used in this study will allow researchers, physicians, and caregivers to proactively identify and monitor increasing risks for deteriorating cognitive function (progressing from normal aging to MCI and from MCI to AD) in a way that is not currently possible, transforming AD prevention trials and significantly reducing the cost and consequences of functional decline in our aging population. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease, their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults with who are at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and the reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to assess day-to-day functioning in a new way which will more effectively identify the subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence.",Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease,9762804,R01AG058687,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caregivers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Prevention', 'Prevention trial', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'disease diagnosis', 'functional decline', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'normal aging', 'pre-clinical', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'time use']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,540842,-0.009439915675117434
"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9696812,R01DA045705,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alprazolam', 'American', 'American Medical Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Baby Booms', 'Beer', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elderly', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicare', 'Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Portraits', 'Poverty', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Dependence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'beneficiary', 'benzodiazepine misuse', 'care providers', 'clinical candidate', 'cohort', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indicated prevention', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'older patient', 'overdose risk', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'selective prevention', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,388353,0.1464981257538209

"Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study Project Summary Over 100 million Americans will be over age 65 years by 2060 (representing 25% of the U.S. population), with an increasing proportion of African-Americans. Understanding which Americans exhibit “exceptionally healthy aging”—an older life free of illness, disability, or functional limitation—is central to efforts to improve quality of life and resource utilization. Current investigations on “healthy aging” focus on systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-6) or composite indices of organ/metabolic function (the “healthy aging index,” HAI), both lim- ited by a (1) lack of sensitivity for early changes in metabolism; (2) lack of specificity for molecular pathways involved in these changes; (3) absence of investigation early in adulthood (when “aging” may be reversible); (4) few studies of African-Americans, at high-risk for age-related morbidity. In preparation for this application, we applied metabolite profiling in a pilot study of nearly 300 African-American males in Health ABC, a biracial NIA study of elderly Caucasians and African-Americans, identifying metabolites associated with HAI (oxidative stress, nitric oxide signaling, gut microbial metabolism), some of which may be unique to African-Americans. Here, we hypothesize that circulating metabolites associated with multi-dimensional aging phenotypes and outcomes in older adults will define pathways of “exceptional healthy aging” that may be race-specific and dysregulated in youth at risk for “premature” aging. To address this hypothesis, we will harness two well- characterized, biracial American cohorts that span life (elderly: age 73±3 N=1312; young: CARDIA, age 32±4 N=2376; R01-HL136541). In Aim 1, we define metabolic pathways implicated in race-specific healthy aging, based on association between metabolites and validated age-related phenotypes heterogeneous by race (physical, neurocognitive function, vascular structure, body composition). We will assess determinants of iden- tified pathways, including dietary quality, physical activity, and psychosocial stress (poorer in African- Americans). In Aim 2, we identify metabolites related to “exceptionally healthy aging” in the elderly (freedom from disability, dementia, cancer, cardiovascular disease), their pathways, race-specificity, and overlap with pathways identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we apply machine-learning techniques to metabolites to derive a classi- fier for exceptionally healthy aging in Health ABC and apply this prediction rule to young adults in CARDIA to identify young adults at risk for unhealthy aging. We then investigate whether individuals marked for premature aging develop adverse aging phenotypes decades later (neurocognitive, physical, vascular, clinical outcome). This proposal addresses a core mission of the NIA (directly responsive to PA-17-088) by defining a metabolic basis for “exceptional healthy aging” across race and at the extremes of life. We leverage rich phenotypes within Health ABC, funded efforts within CARDIA, and a team experienced in aging epidemiology, metabolic research, and data science approaches. Successful completion of this project will furnish a rich molecular phe- notypic resource to the aging community for investigation of mechanisms and biomarkers of biological aging. Project Narrative Nearly 100 million Americans will be >65 years by 2060. Current clinical-biochemical metrics of aging do not capture accelerated aging, specifically the clinical observation that African Americans are at especially high risk of age-related morbidity. Here, we perform metabolite profiling in the Health ABC study to identify metabolic pathways central to healthy aging across race and examine these pathways in a separate longitudinal study of young adults (CARDIA), redefining aging as a systemic metabolic disease impacting function and outcomes in Caucasian and African-Americans across life.",Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study,9750581,R01AG059729,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caucasians', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Diet', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Freedom', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Premature aging syndrome', 'Preparation', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'ST14 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'biracial', 'caucasian American', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'disability', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fitness', 'healthy aging', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'male', 'mental state', 'microbial', 'middle age', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sarcopenia', 'walking speed', 'young adult']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,559078,0.056875536236769574
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9785384,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2019,158220,0.11217519482963846
"Improving patient and caregiver engagement through the application of data science methods to audio recorded clinic visits stored in personal health libraries PROJECT SUMMARY    Forty to eighty percent of clinic visit information is forgotten by patients immediately post visit, a significant  barrier to self-­management leading to poor health outcomes. Visit summaries can improve recall, yet patient  uptake is limited and clinicians report significant burden in creating summaries for laypeople. Patients are  beginning to audio record visits and clinics are now offering this service. When patients receive a clinic  recording, 71% listen and 68% share it with a caregiver, resulting in improved understanding and self-­ management. Yet, unstructured recordings are difficult to navigate. Personal health libraries (PHLs) may help  patients organize health information;; yet current PHLs do not facilitate clinic-­recordings. The objective of this  project is to develop a PHL that integrates clinic audio-­recordings (Audio-­PHL), using data science methods to  link medical terms from the recording to trustworthy patient resources, which can be retrieved, organized,

strategies of older adults with multimorbidity and caregivers;; Aim 2 Develop an Audio-­PHL using data science  methods to securely analyze clinic visit recordings and make this information accessible and understandable  for patients;; and Aim 3 Demonstrate the usability and use of an Audio-­PHL in older adults with multimorbidity  and caregivers. Applicants hypothesize: (1) The Audio-­PHL will surpass acceptable usability metrics in older  adults and caregivers and (2) natural language processing (NLP) methods developed for the Audio-­PHL will  accurately identify key visit information (e.g. medication) and connect it to credible patient resources. The  development of the Audio-­PHL follows a user centered design model. In Aim 1, the applicants will use  participatory design activities with 48 end-­users to inform Audio-­PHL design. In Aim 2, the Audio-­PHL will be  created in iterative cycles informed by findings from Aim 1. In Aim 3, extensive usability evaluation will be  conducted in human computer interaction (HCI) laboratory settings to ensure Audio-­PHL surpasses acceptable

"A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults Abstract  People aged 65+ will represent 21% of the U.S. population and increase to about 80 million by 2040, and the oldest old (age 85+) will number ~ 14.1 million. Population aging presents both opportunities and challenges for our healthcare, the economy, and existing social support systems. Many older adults especially the oldest old, minorities and those of lower Socio-Economic status (SES) are particularly vulnerable to social isolation, poor diet, and decreased levels of physical activity each of which influence morbidity and mortality. Mobile-based, tablet-based, and in-home technologies provide an excellent opportunity for projecting behavior- change interventions and social support into the everyday life of older adults at great economies of scale. The objectives of this study are to examine the usability and efficacy, for diverse older adults, of a new tablet-based dynamic system: the Fittle Senior System (FSS) that will provide: (1) personalized behavior-change programs for improved diet and increased physical activity and (2) online social interaction and support from small teams pursuing similar goals. The system builds on two technology-based systems developed by the investigative team: (1) the computer-based PRISM system, designed for older populations to support social connectivity and well-being, and (2) the Fittle+ mobile platform designed to support positive health behavior change through integrated online social support and personalized coaching based on artificial intelligence (AI). The study will be conducted in two phases. During Phase 1 we will develop and pilot test the FSS with representative samples of older adults. Phase 2 will involve a two group randomized trial where participants will be randomized to the Fittle Senior System (FSS, an adaptive coaching and social support system using mobile technology) or to a paper-based psycho-educational (BPE) control condition following a baseline assessment. The duration of the intervention phase will involve an active 12-week intervention phase followed by a 12-week maintenance phase. We will recruit and randomize 180 community dwelling adults aged 65+ years, who live alone and are at risk for social isolation (90 per condition - 30 White Caucasians, 30 Black/African Americans and 30 Hispanic Americans). We will recruit males and females commensurate to the gender proportions represented in this age group and work to ensure that we have sufficient representation from the “oldest old” cohort. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3mths post active intervention and 3mths post maintenance (6mths following active intervention) on clinically significant measures of health and health behaviors and indices of social support. We will also gather information on potential moderating (e.g., ethnicity, age) and mediating variables (e.g., health self-efficacy), which will be examined using multilevel modeling techniques guided by current theories of behavior change and technology acceptance and use among older adults. Project Narrative This proposed project is addressing a critical public concern. The population is aging and chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are common among older adults especially ethnic minorities. This study will develop and evaluate a mobile technology-based intervention designed to support positive health behavior change among diverse older adults through integrated online social support, personalized coaching and goal setting.",A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults,9791132,R01AG053163,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caucasians', 'Chronic', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Industry', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Jordan', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Older Population', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Self Efficacy', 'Social Interaction', 'Social isolation', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Support System', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'active method', 'age group', 'aged', 'aging and technology', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinically significant', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'dynamic system', 'education research', 'efficacy trial', 'ethnic minority population', 'family structure', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'low socioeconomic status', 'male', 'medical schools', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'nutrition', 'programs', 'psychoeducational', 'psychoeducational intervention', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,587119,0.12250430798267131
"Robot-Assisted Cognitive Training for Socially Isolated Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment This project will develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) to provide cognitive training, in the form of learning to play the piano, to improve cognitive functioning and reduce feelings of loneliness in socially-isolated older adults. The SAR will administer cognitive training via guided practice on a set of standard piano lesson tasks designed to reflect particular cognitive functions: memory, attention, language, and social acuity. The goals of this project are that the SAR will (1) engage the persons with mild cognitive impairment (PMCI) in skill-building cognitive music training; (2) enhance cognitive functioning, in particular verbal and visual memory, reasoning ability, and complex attention; and (3) reduce feelings of loneliness. This SAR can be used as both a personalized social companion and an interactive tutor to deliver customized training for cognitive functioning and social engagement. We have assembled a strong multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, roboticists, engineers, human factors specialists, neuroscientists, and gerontologists, well suited to achieve goals. Dementia is a costly chronic disease; an estimated $259 billion was spent in 2017 for health care, long-term care, and out-of-pocket expenses. Furthermore, social isolation is a problem many older adults face, with 1 in 3 older adults reporting loneliness in the United States. Socially assistive robotics (SARs) have the potential to provide mental and social engagement – especially for those older adults who may lack social connections. In particular, SARs can utilize machine learning to provide customized and socially-engaging cognitive training for lonely older adults with MCI.",Robot-Assisted Cognitive Training for Socially Isolated Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment,9980524,R42AG060800,"['Adoption', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Esthetics', 'Face', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Loneliness', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Music', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Reporting', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social Concepts', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Specialist', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Uninsured Medical Expense', 'United States', 'aged', 'body language', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive training', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'preference', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'robot assistance', 'robot interface', 'sensory integration', 'skills', 'social', 'social assistive robot', 'social engagement', 'tutoring', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'visual memory', 'web app']",NIA,APPLIED UNIVERSAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION,R42,2019,1999103,0.10068656597919655
"Multimorbidity and Treatment-Related Outcomes in Older Heart Failure Patients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF) is the most common reason for hospitalization in older adults. Over 85% of all patients hospitalized with HF are 65 years of age or older. Multimorbidity, typically defined as the presence of ≥2 chronic conditions, increases the risks of hospitalization and death in older HF patients, and greatly complicates the clinical management of HF. Caution is required in applying national clinical practice guidelines to the care of older adults with multimorbidity, as this could result in undesirable net effects and less than optimal outcomes including adverse interactions between drugs and various concomitant diseases. In response to PA-17-088 (Exploratory Analyses of Existing Cohorts, Data Sets, and Stored Biospecimens to Address Clinical Aging Research Questions, R01), we propose to leverage an existing HF cohort, including data for more than 100,000 patients with HF within the Cardiovascular Research Network between 2005-2012, with follow-up data up to 2017. We will extend our previous efforts by examining treatment patterns and the net benefits versus harms of selected therapies in older adults with HF and a wide spectrum of multimorbidity burden. We will further examine the benefits and adverse outcomes of various therapies focusing on particularly vulnerable subgroups of patients with HF afflicted by two prevalent conditions, anemia or diabetes. Our specific aims are: (1) to examine the effectiveness of selected medical therapies (renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system blockers, beta-blockers, diuretics, and aldosterone receptor blockers) on death, HF hospitalization, and all-cause hospitalizations in a large, community-based population of older adults with HF across a range of levels of multimorbidity burden and left ventricular ejection fraction; (2) to evaluate targeted adverse outcomes, including kidney dysfunction, hyperkalemia, sodium disturbances, bradycardia, and syncope associated with selected HF therapies in older adults with HF, stratified by multimorbidity burden and left ventricular ejection fraction status; and (3) to characterize the potential benefits and adverse outcomes associated with selected HF therapies in older adults with HF and two prevalent comorbidity dyads—HF- diabetes and HF-anemia—that are common and substantially increase the risks of death and morbidity. In addition, we will create novel, validated methods to identify adverse outcomes related to HF therapies from unstructured data in large electronic health record systems through natural language processing technology, along with employing state-of-the-art analytic approaches to evaluate treatment-related outcomes. In that our proposed investigation will take advantage of a large, geographically and demographically diverse cohort of adults with HF receiving care within community-based healthcare delivery systems, we anticipate our findings will be highly generalizable to the broad spectrum of older adults with HF managed in “real-world” practice settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The presence of multiple chronic conditions, or multimorbidity, in older adults with heart failure substantially increases the complexity of their care, and increases the risks of hospitalization and death. In our study, we will examine treatment patterns and the net benefits versus harms of selected therapies in patients with heart failure and multimorbidity.

"Modernizing the Assessment of Financial Decision Making: Development and Evaluation of a Simulated Online Money Management Task in Older Adults The advent of digital finance and online money management (OMM) services has changed the ways in which we conduct everyday transactions. Based on my preliminary F32 survey findings, the number of older adults who use technology is drastically growing and the way they approach financial transactions is certainly changing. Given the increasing number of older adults and corresponding diseases of aging such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), the vulnerability of older adults to financial exploitation, and the pervasiveness of financial decision making in everyday life, it is critical to be able to accurately examine financial decision making using objective, quantifiable, and ecologically valid tasks that are in keeping with the current trends. In 2016, an expert panel working for the US Social Security Administration found a gap between the current assessment of financial decision making and real-world financial performance. The current proposal seeks to bridge this gap by developing and applying simulation technology-based OMM task to assess financial decision making in individuals across the spectrum of cognitive aging. Accordingly, the first two aims (K99/Mentored phase) of the current proposal are to establish the reliability and validity of a novel, simulated OMM credit card statement review task in cognitively healthy older adults via psychometrically rigorous approaches. The third and fourth inferential aims (R00 phase) are to use: (i) a longitudinal strategy to track OMM over time and in relation to cognitive changes in cognitively healthy older adults, and (ii) a cross-sectional strategy to examine OMM in two clinical groups (mild AD and those judged as financially incapable by Adult Protective Services) versus healthy older adults. To accomplish these aims, I will develop advanced skills to supplement my strong neuropsychological training, by: 1) gaining expertise in developing and conducting functional assessments using state-of-the-art technology; 2) developing a deeper knowledge of psychometric measurement to optimize task design; and 3) enriching my conceptual understanding of financial decision making while learning how to incorporate neuroeconomic principles and metacognitive assessment in financial decision making measurement. I have assembled an excellent and well-rounded mentorship team consisting of a computer scientist, biostatistician, gerontologist, economist, and expert neuropsychologists. Overall, this K99/R00 proposal enables me to lay a foundation for an independent research career focused on using technology to accurately conceptualize financial decision making in cognitively diverse older adults, a goal that is in line with the NIA’s mission to improve “the health, well-being, and independence of adults as they age”. Older adults, a wealthy segment of the population, are known to exhibit compromised financial decision making especially in the context of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease. As the landscape of financial decision making has changed dramatically with rapid technological advances, there is a growing gap between the skills necessary for everyday financial decision making and the way it in which it is assessed clinically. Given the precipitous, ongoing and projected increase in the number of older adults and their use of technology, it is imperative to develop financial decision making measures that approximate real world functioning in the current technological culture that can inform clinical determination of financial decision making abilities, and shape public policies aimed at minimizing financial losses.",Modernizing the Assessment of Financial Decision Making: Development and Evaluation of a Simulated Online Money Management Task in Older Adults,9721902,K99AG062783,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Factor Analysis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Psychologist', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Policy', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Review Literature', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States Social Security Administration', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Writing', 'age related', 'alertness', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive task', 'design', 'digital', 'executive function', 'exhaustion', 'financial decision making', 'financial exploitation', 'financial literacy', 'improved', 'instrument', 'literacy', 'middle age', 'neuroeconomics', 'novel', 'online course', 'preservation', 'rate of change', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2019,132543,0.12876859183065154
"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,9623369,R01NR016423,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Gait', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'active control', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'fitness', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'improved', 'information display', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'preference', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'walking speed', 'wearable device']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2019,100000,0.05785451971571519
"Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality Abstract Older adults struggle to engage in health enhancing physical activity (PA) and spend up to 11 hours a day sitting. Older women, in particular, are at increased risk of chronic disease and disability, and use a high proportion of healthcare resources. Improving both these behaviors has promise for improving several salient aging outcomes, but evidence to inform guidelines on how best to interrupt long periods of sedentary behavior (SB) are lacking. Few laboratory-based trials have included adults over 70 years old, have focused on PA to interrupt SB, and have not tested standing breaks that might be acceptable to older adults. A recent review showed that in the real world, traditional PA interventions do not meaningfully impact SB. In contrast, interventions that focus on standing can reduce SB, up to 2 hours per day. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between self-reported SB and increased risks of death and metabolic outcomes, but very few prospective studies have employed objective measures of SB. Although accelerometer measures can indicate the intensity of movement or lack of it, traditional cutpoints do not accurately classify behaviors such as sitting, standing or walking. While pilot intervention studies, using thigh worn inclinometers, have demonstrated that SB can be greatly reduced, there are no RCTs in older adults with health outcomes. There is much room for improvement in our understanding of SB and healthy aging. The National Institute on Aging conducted a summer workshop series to address this issue in 2013. We have therefore designed a Program project – Sedentary Time and Aging Research (STAR) – to provide more rigorous and comprehensive evidence on how to interrupt sitting time and the consequences for healthy aging. In particular, we are proposing a paradigm shift away from energy expenditure as the primary mechanism for health outcomes to investigating behaviors such as brief sit-to-stand transitions that expend little energy but engage muscles, improve postural blood flow, and may impact physical functioning in older adults. Further, we will study a broader range of outcomes than investigated to date, including targeted novel mechanisms important for healthy aging. The STAR program will include 3 Projects and 2 Cores for study of postmenopausal women at risk for chronic disease. STAR includes 2 randomized trials, in the laboratory (N=86) and in the real world (N=592), with focus on optimizing new computational techniques to apply to existing prospective accelerometer data (n>6000). All projects will investigate the consequences of extended sitting, standing, brief sit-to-stand transitions and PA breaks on mechanisms of healthy aging including glucose regulation, endothelial functioning, and mitochondrial functioning. We will also investigate physical functioning, blood pressure and in Project 3, 5-7 year mortality risk. All Projects will compare effects across age groups. STAR will provide a comprehensive evidence base that can inform public health guidelines on SB and aging. We will coordinate our efforts with a new American Heart Association Center on SB and Latinas.  Narrative Sitting time may be particularly bad for the health of older women. This program grant will provide new and improved evidence to help the public understand how to interrupt sitting in ways that support healthy aging.  ","Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality",9720802,P01AG052352,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Computational Technique', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Endothelium', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Latina', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Mitochondria', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Postmenopause', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'age effect', 'age group', 'attentional control', 'base', 'behavior observation', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'disability', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'exercise intervention', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'older women', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'response biomarker', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'young adult']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",P01,2019,1795436,0.06235700772360702
"High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression Project Summary/Abstract: Depression (target disease of this proposal) affects 34 million Americans including 2 million seniors per year. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (target population of this proposal). The vascular depression hypothesis (proposed in 1998) remains the most salient theory explaining the onset and perpetuation of depression in older adults. This model is based on the observation that in older adults, white matter hyperintensities (a hallmark of small vessel disease, SVD) are associated with depression onset and perpetuation. Progress in understanding the relationship of small vessel disease with late-life depression has been stymied in part by lack of specificity of white matter hyperintensities which can represent components of edema, gliosis, ischemia, and inflammation. Traditional MR imaging is unable to distinguish between these components, and thus the specific mechanisms that contribute to depression remain unclear.  The emergence of ultrahigh field MR imaging allows for greater specificity of the WMH lesions, and other components of small vessel disease. Bringing 7 tesla (T) imaging into mainstream clinical use will be accomplished through 1) having exclusive (over 1.5/3T) application(s) and 2) achieving robust, safe, consistent, and homogenous high-quality images. Through a consortium consisting of experts at University of Pittsburgh combined with collaboration at FDA, University of Minnesota, and Quality Electrodynamics Inc., our goal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. We will achieve this goal through the development of robust radiofrequency methodology, as well as pulse sequences that produce 7T images with the aforementioned necessary attributes. This will be paired with complementary 3T MRI at baseline. We will use our recently developed (as well as a proposed) custom designed 7T radiofrequency coil system and pulse sequences that are already being used in disease/patient studies. Based on our preliminary results, the proposed RF solution will provide unprecedented homogeneity and consistency among different subjects/patients, and therefore excellent signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio for detection of components of small vessel disease. The study will examine two cohorts 1) a group of 30 older adults recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) for developing an MRI to histopathology statistical model of SVD and 2) 60 older adults with late-life depression who will undergo scanning at baseline and after 2 years. The longitudinal 7T MRI and SVD model will be used to help characterize the small vessel changes associated with depression in older adults.  In summary, this study develops an emerging and timely technology (high-performance ultrahigh field MRI) to study a critical pathophysiological process (cerebral small vessel disease) in a clinically relevant population (Late-Life Depression). This project will further advance all of these three domains. Project Narrative: The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. This will be accomplished through the development of radiofrequency hardware, methodology, pulse sequences and protocols using 7 Tesla (T) human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in conjunction with complimentary 3T MRI. The clinical relevance of the proposed tools will be achieved through comprehensive characterization of 1) components of cerebral small vessel disease in individuals with late-life depression and 2) progression of small vessel disease markers over 2 years. One of our overarching goals is to achieve a highly useful 7T clinical utility, which requires high quality, robust, and consistent acquisitions. This could be a potentially exclusive (over other human MRI field strengths) application for 7T imaging.",High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression,9729082,R01MH111265,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Consultations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Edema', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Gliosis', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Heating', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'Work', 'absorption', 'aging brain', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disturbance in affect', 'follow-up', 'geriatric depression', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'radio frequency', 'recruit', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'vascular depression']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,600019,0.08460583172114583
"Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in older adults (≥65y) is rising, and there is limited evidence-based guidance on treating these older adults. In older patients with multi-morbidity, treatment decisions should factor in not only risk of disease complications, but also treatment complications and non-IBD, extra-intestinal complications. Hence, to inform optimal treatment approach, a comprehensive assessment of comparative effects of different therapies on all of these outcomes is warranted. Existing single-center observational studies are limited by small sample size, and missing data due to fragmented health care, whereas administrative claims-based studies are limited by lack of detailed clinical data; these limitations can be overcome by linking the two data sources. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Siddharth Singh proposes to: (Aim #1.1) characterize disease burden and treatment patterns, (Aim #1.2) assess and predict risks of death, disease, treatment and extra-intestinal complications using machine-learning algorithms and (Aim #2.1) compare overall effectiveness and (Aim #2.2) safety of different treatment strategies in older patients with IBD. This will be studied using a highly innovative informatics-based approach in a multi-site, electronic medical record (EMR)-based cohort of older patients with IBD, linked to their corresponding Medicare claims. The EMR-based cohort will facilitate phenotyping and disease severity assessment, and linkage to Medicare claims will augment exposure and outcome ascertainment, overcoming challenges of fragmentation of healthcare and short follow-up. The central hypothesis is that, that older adults have systematically different risk profiles than younger adults, and using biologic monotherapy is a safer and more effective approach to treating IBD, as compared to using long-term corticosteroids alone, non-biologic immunomodulator monotherapy, and combination therapy of biologics and immunomodulators. The access to the advanced infrastructure of pSCANNER (Patient-centered Scalable National Network for Effectiveness Research), one of 13 PCORI-funded Clinical Data Research Networks, and entire Medicare database, in a highly supportive and conducive environment at UCSD, with cross-disciplinary mentorship by a collaborative and experienced team of mentors and advisors from diverse backgrounds (clinical informatics, comparative effectiveness research, IBD therapeutics) is a key strength of this application. Besides directly informing clinical practice on treatment approaches in older patients with IBD, this proposal will enhance the career of the candidate by providing unique skills in applied clinical informatics, privacy-preserving record linkage techniques, predictive analytics, and comparative effectiveness research, and create a multi-institutional, EMR- based cohort of well-characterized IBD patients, linked with Medicare claims. This will ultimately contribute to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career focusing on comparative effectiveness research and population health management using novel informatics-based approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The information on comparative effectiveness and safety of different therapies in the context of patients' risk profile generated using this novel informatics-based approach in a unique linked EMR-Medicare database, will directly inform treatment of older patients with IBD, and enhance comparative effectiveness research methods.",Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,9735225,K23DK117058,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunomodulators', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Steroids', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Thromboembolism', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health management', 'high risk', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optimal treatments', 'patient oriented', 'personalized medicine', 'population health', 'preservation', 'risk minimization', 'skills', 'treatment risk', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K23,2019,203990,0.09394590394893765

Because of the loss of cognitive function and subsequent changes in employment and reduced engagement with social groups and hobbies, AD/ADRD patients often experience loneliness and social isolation, and the considerable challenge of caring for these individuals often causes similar effects in caregivers. If successful, SARA will have significant impact on AD/ADRD patient care and quality of life, reducing loneliness and social isolation.  The specific aims of this two-year pilot study are to: (1) adapt commercial robot and peripheral hardware to create accessible interactions for AD/ADRD patients; (2) design and develop the robot interaction software to provide rich, supportive interaction; and (3) assess the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of SARA with AD/ADRD older adults and their caregivers. SARA employs user-community-driven design processes and evaluations to address key challenges surrounding how to best apply commercial robots and engaging interaction methodologies to improve AD/ADRD patient care. We will develop SARA through an iterative development process that produces and evaluates three versions of the system during the Phase I effort.  SARA is significant in three ways. SARA reduces loneliness by providing robotic social interactions. SARA reduces social isolation by connecting the patient more closely with family, friends, and caregivers, both directly and through social media. SARA provides social assistance in three ways: (1) through automated reminders and question answering for everyday information that is easily and often forgotten by patients; (2) conveyance of health regimens (e.g., What can I have for lunch? Should I still exercise today?); and (3) monitoring for caregivers.  SARA contains three central innovations. First, to create a user experience that is well tuned to the needs of patients and caregivers, SARA is created with significant feedback from AD/ADRD patients and caregivers. Second, to enable us to build on multiple robotic platforms that can meet this user experience, and to provide future extensibility, SARA features a platform-agnostic software and hardware framework that can integrate with a wide range of consumer social robots. Third, to create engaging, believable, and effective interactions with AD/ADRD patients, SARA uses and extends an AI-based architecture, Hap, which is specifically designed to create socially engaging interactive characters and robots that provide enjoyable and stimulating interactions. Project Narrative  As many as 5.5 million Americans may have Alzheimer’s disease, an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, eventually impairing the ability to carry out even the simplest tasks. Socially-Assistive Robots for Alzheimer’s (SARA) is a socially integrative and supportive robot to enhance the connectedness, caregiving, well-being, and quality of life of older adults experiencing early to middle stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD). SARA helps alleviate the social isolation and loneliness that AD/ADRD can have on individuals and their caregivers, improving quality of life, reducing the monetary and social costs of care, and increasing the overall access and impact of care.",Socially-Assistive Robots for AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs (SARA),9909512,R43AG066288,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Brain Diseases', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Health', 'Hobbies', 'Home environment', 'Human Subject Research', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Loneliness', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Services', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Work', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Thinking', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'care burden', 'care costs', 'care systems', 'caregiving', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'early experience', 'experience', 'family support', 'human-robot interaction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'loved ones', 'new technology', 'programs', 'research study', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'social', 'social assistive robot', 'social group', 'social media', 'usability']",NIA,"CHARLES RIVER ANALYTICS, INC.",R43,2019,535315,-0.010332142099345496
"Assessing the effectiveness of oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of underutilization due to dementia, recurrent falls, or poor anticoagulation quality Despite the markedly increased risk of stroke, nearly 50% of older adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) did not follow clinical guidelines to receive anticoagulation therapy. Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementia (AD/ADRD), and other features highly associated with AD/ADRD, including falls, and difficulty in maintaining good anticoagulation quality when receiving warfarin are among the major barriers of oral anticoagulant (OAC) prescribing. These factors also complicate the decisions regarding the optimal choice among specific OACs and appropriateness of switching a warfarin user to receive one of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), which have more predictable pharmacokinetic profiles and cause less intracranial hemorrhage than does warfarin. Despite the seemingly abundant data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and routine-care settings, there was very little data evaluating the effects of OACs specifically in patients with AD/ADRD and its associated high-risk features, leaving large numbers of AF patients with AD/ADRD unanticoagulated without clear guidance. Because RCTs are unlikely to recruit and retain older adults with AD/ADRD that is representative of the patients in routine care, we aim to address these critical knowledge gaps with a combined dataset incorporating rich clinical information from electronic health records and longitudinal claims data covering >3 millions nationally representative Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and above with non-valvular AF from 2011-2018, using state-of-the-art methodologies. Our specific aims include: 1) Determine comparative effectiveness and safety of use vs. non-use of oral anticoagulants in patients aged 65 and above with non-valvular AF and AD/ADRD (stratified by a validated activities of daily living [ADL] score and use of dementia medications), and/or high-risk features associated with AD/ADRD, including poor predicted anticoagulation quality and high risk of falls assessed by a validated algorithms; 2): Determine comparative effectiveness and safety of warfarin vs. specific DOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) in patients aged 65 and above with non-valvular AF and AD/ADRD, and/or high-risk features associated with AD/ADRD; 3) Determine comparative effectiveness and safety of switching to a DOAC vs. continuing warfarin in chronic users of warfarin aged 65 or older with non-valvular AF and AD/ADRD, and/or high-risk features associated with AD/ADRD. Successful accomplishment of this study will provide data to help clinicians estimate accurately the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation therapy in the vulnerable older adults with AD/ADRD and non-valvular AF, which will 1) support optimal use and b) avoid unnecessary withholding of an OAC. Importantly, this research will also produce a novel, generalizable approach to evaluate treatment effect heterogeneity of drug therapy by important clinical factors using both electronic health records and health insurance claims data with optimal validity and estimation precision. The proposed research aims to investigate how treatment effects of warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are affected by presence of Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementia (AD/ADRD), and other features highly associated with AD/ADRD. This study is relevant to public health because it is expected to generate evidence that can help clinicians choose the optimal anticoagulation regimen in the many older adults with AD/ADRD and atrial fibrillation based on readily observable clinical features. Our study will also produce a generalizable analytic approach integrating several advanced methods to evaluate treatment effect heterogeneity by key clinical factors with optimal validity and estimation precision.","Assessing the effectiveness of oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of underutilization due to dementia, recurrent falls, or poor anticoagulation quality",9711944,RF1AG063381,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Guidelines', 'Health Insurance', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'International Normalized Ratio', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medication Errors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Odds Ratio', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patient Representative', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prothrombin time assay', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Stroke prevention', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Warfarin', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care delivery', 'comparative effectiveness', 'dementia risk', 'evidence base', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'frailty', 'health care service utilization', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'novel', 'population based', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'routine care', 'safety net', 'simulation', 'stroke risk', 'treatment choice', 'treatment effect']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,RF1,2019,2150379,0.057103343661502215
"Frailty, Statins, and Cardiovascular Disease Burden in Older Adults Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in older adults. Statins are highly effective cholesterol-lowering medications used for primary prevention of CVD, and are the most commonly prescribed medications. After age 75, data on the effects of statins are limited to guide statin prescribing recommendations. However, even where the evidence is clear, statins remain under-prescribed. Reasons for under-prescribing of proven CVD prevention medications such as statins in older adults are many, and may include competing medical conditions, adverse side effects (e.g., myalgias), and frailty. Frailty is a multidimensional state of decreased physiologic reserve associated with an increased risk of CVD and poor clinical outcomes. The aging population is heterogeneous and a one-size fits all approach may not be appropriate. In particular, understanding the utility of statins for prevention of CVD in individuals who are vulnerable or frail is critical. Therefore, the research activities in this GEMSSTAR award will use a retrospective design to (1) understand patterns of statin use in a large cohort of older US veterans aged 65 and older, over 15 years of follow up, with particular attention to the relationship between frailty, myalgias and statin use; and (2) examine the association between statin use for primary prevention of CVD in pre-frail and frail older veterans and cardiovascular events, health care utilization, and mortality. This work will inform the design of future clinical trials of statins for prevention of CVD in older adults accounting for heterogeneity of aging and frailty. In addition to the pharmacoepidemiologic study proposed, this GEMSSTAR award includes mentorship, coursework, and seminars in advanced epidemiologic and statistical methods, geriatrics, and cardiology. The research and career development activities will prepare the applicant for her long-term goal of a research career in geriatric preventive cardiology and will inform preventive care for the aging population. As the population ages, identifying preventive strategies for heart disease and stroke is a priority. However, proven preventive medications such as the cholesterol-lowering statins remain underused. In this study, we aim to understand patterns of statin use in older adults to shed light on why statins may be underused even where evidence is clear, and to examine whether statins are useful in preventing heart disease and stroke in older adults who are vulnerable or frail.","Frailty, Statins, and Cardiovascular Disease Burden in Older Adults",9753091,R03AG060169,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Event', 'Frail Elderly', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Medical', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myalgia', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive therapy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Probability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Role', 'Smoking Status', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Veterans', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'aging population', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'male', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'prevent', 'research and development', 'side effect', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R03,2019,96525,0.14407384656306263
"Prospective Monitoring of Newly Approved Cardiovascular Drugs in Older Adults with Frailty PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects 70% of older adults and remains the leading cause of morbidity and mor- tality in the United States. Several new drugs have recently been approved for CVD, but not enough is known about their utilization, benefits and risks in frail older patients. Since conducting a clinical trial in frail older adults can be costly and impractical, there is a pressing need for innovative strategies to generate evidence on new CVD drugs in a timely manner. The objective of this application is to establish a near-real-time prospective monitoring program in Medicare data to evaluate the benefit of new CVD drugs for older adults with frailty. A prospective monitoring program seeks to find early effectiveness and safety signals of new drugs by updating the analysis at regular intervals as new Medicare data become available. The investigators will incorporate a novel claims-based frailty index into the monitoring program to generate timely evidence on disease-specific and patient-centered net benefit of new drugs by frailty status. The central hypothesis is that disease-specific benefit and net benefit are determined by a patient's degree of frailty. Disease-specific benefit will be evaluated using clinical trial endpoints of effectiveness (e.g., CVD events) and safety (e.g., bleeding), and net benefit in terms of the number of days alive and spent at home, or “home time”. To conduct this work, the investigators will analyze Medicare data on 6 new CVD drugs approved in 2011-2017: 3 anticoagulants vs warfarin for atrial fibrillation, 2 antiplatelets vs clopidogrel for atherosclerotic CVD, and an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor vs enalapril for systolic heart failure. The validity and reproducibility of the results will be enhanced through the linkage of a subset of Medicare data to electronic health records and a national survey to supplement clinical information, and external validation of the Medicare data analysis in 2 large commercial databases. In the next 4 years, the investigators will accomplish 3 specific aims: 1) evaluate the temporal trends and predictors of new CVD drug use in frail and non-frail older adults with CVD over 2011-2020; 2) determine disease-specific benefit (deaths, CVD and safety events) and net benefit (home time) of 6 new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies; 3) identify patient characteristics that can predict net benefit (home time) with new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies. This proposal's innovative approach, which combines near-real-time prospective monitor- ing, a claims-based frailty score, and the patient-centered outcome of home time, offers a readily scalable and feasible framework for comparative effectiveness and safety studies of newly approved medications. The impact of the proposed research is significant because timely evidence generated from real-world healthcare data can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new CVD drugs based on a patient's frailty and expected net benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to establish a prospective monitoring program for newly approved cardiovascular drugs for older adults with frailty in routine healthcare databases and identify predictors of benefit from the new drugs. This research is relevant to public health because the evidence generated from this work can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new cardiovascular drugs in older adults based on a patient's frailty level and expected net benefit.

"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing,9535033,R01AG055337,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Anesthetics', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Records', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Perioperative', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'base', 'care costs', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peer', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2018,460052,0.06807730693189654
"Deep Learning Gait Analytics for Primary Care Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is the third leading cause of death in older adults in the US. Over 4.7 million Americans aged 65 and older live with AD and this number is expected to climb to nearly 14 million by 2050. However, fewer than 50% of individuals with AD have been diagnosed. and patients who have the condition are unlikely to receive a full diagnostic workup to identify the cause(s) of their impairment. Detection of functional markers is an essential first step toward prevention and early diagnosis of MCI, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and related dementias. Recently, several highly regarded clinical aging studies have demonstrated that subtle changes in gait are early, sensitive and specific, noninvasive risk markers for both cognitive decline and fall risk. The majority of these clinical investigations have used an instrumented mat system (e.g. the GaitRite system) that measures spatio-temporal gait parameters from footfalls. Although the literature is consistent about the potential for spatio-temporal footfall-based metrics as a predictor of MCI and dementia, the technology industry has not delivered an accurate yet affordable solution appropriate for widespread use in a primary care setting. A new and novel approach is required to transfer the significant clinical research findings to clinical practice. The goal of this SBIR is to create an accurate, low cost, simple-to-use primary care clinical screening tool for MCI and dementia and a risk assessment and stratification tool for older adults with normal cognition. This will be accomplished by commercializing recent research in novel software-based deep learning marker-less motion capture and advanced kinematic analysis methods. A secure mobile application and cloud-based big data analytics platform delivers this Software-as-a Service to providers with the low cost and ease-of use required to accelerate adoption. This new approach applies deep learning technology to measure footfall-based gait parameters. It can replicate the level of precision and accuracy of expensive (>$35,000) and space-consuming electronic mats used in previous research studies. In addition, our work will significantly advance the research field by simultaneously measuring, from the same video stream, accurate 3D joint angles, which have recently been shown to be even more specific markers of neurodegeneration compared to footfall parameters. Long Term Goal: All patients will routinely have equal access to advanced gait analytics in primary care practices. By providing a consistent methodology, including integration in the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit, very large population data will be collected and analyzed to provide new insights into early stages of dementia, discover new functional markers from 3D kinematics, improve diagnostic assessments, and identify new preventive strategies for cognitive decline and risk of falls. Alzheimer’s disease continues to be difficult to predict and diagnose in clinical settings and  while advanced imaging, neuropsychological testing and CSF measures may be available to specialized  clinician investigators involved in research and clinical trials, these are not accessible to  general health care providers. Research has clearly demonstrated that quantitative measures of  gait, not routinely assessed in a clinic, can contribute substantially to identifying older adults  at high risk for transitioning to dementia.  Availability of the GaitIQ motion capture system at a  primary care or geriatric clinic will aid the early identification of older adults who need further  clinical evaluation, supportive treatment and rehabilitative care.",Deep Learning Gait Analytics for Primary Care,9622209,R43AG060855,"['Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognition', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Joints', 'Legal patent', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk stratification', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stream', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'cohort', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fall risk', 'gait examination', 'health information technology', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'primary care setting', 'rehabilitative care', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'software as a service', 'spatiotemporal', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'web services']",NIA,"GAITIQ, LLC",R43,2018,459656,-0.0027594944847880226
"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this application is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smart phones, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to perform health assessment and detection of health events (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to support sustainable improvement of brain health (Aim 3). Finally, we train machine learning algorithms from the clinical observations to automate assessment of health and intervention impact (Aim 4). The use of these technologies is expected to improve and extend the functional health and wellbeing of older adults, lead to more proactive and preventative health care, and reduce the caregiver burden of health monitoring and assistance. By understanding situational factors that impact prompt adherence, adherence situations can be increased. The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new machine learning techniques for activity learning and health assessment based on clinical ground truth. These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home technology to automatically identify health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smart home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions,9534766,R01NR016732,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Nursing', 'Research', 'Self Management', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain health', 'care costs', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'design', 'health assessment', 'health care delivery', 'health management', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'learning strategy', 'personalized intervention', 'physical conditioning', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'social', 'technology validation', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'usability']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,357881,0.07325099120903916
"Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging Project Summary. Among older adults, sudden and unexpected financial losses as a result of fraud can have devastating consequences. A rapidly aging population, combined with age-related changes in decision-making processes, means that fraudulent activities targeting older adults is a growing public health problem that requires surveillance, education, and intervention. Motivated by theories of cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological aging, this proposal investigates behavioral and neural decision-making mechanisms associated with fraud risk in older adulthood. In a more globally connected and computerized world, older adults may constitute particular at-risk targets for highly effective forms of online financial fraud, such as through social engineering in the form of emails containing malicious links or attachments (phishing). Susceptibility to financial deception in aging has been investigated primarily in the context of age-related cognitive decline, while socioemotional and neurophysiological parameters have been largely understudied. Further, there are few effective approaches to characterize, monitor and detect, and eventually prevent, financial deception. The objectives of the proposed research are threefold: Aim 1 will determine financial deception risk across the adult life span. This aim will seek to confirm that age is associated with greater susceptibility to financial deception, online and in person. Aim 2 will characterize cognitive, socioemotional, and neurophysiological mechanisms associated with deception risk. Specifically, this aim will uncover the extent to which cognitive and socioemotional dysfunction, age-related dampening in neurophysiological reactivity, and structural and functional brain changes contribute to increased susceptibility in aging. Aim 3 involves the development and psychometric validation of a novel risk assessment interview and the development of an automated deception warning tool to alert older adults about potential online fraud. Our research design will span three data collection phases comprising healthy young, middle-aged, young-old, and old-old individuals. Leveraging infrastructure developed in our lab, a behavioral field experiment will determine real-life susceptibility to financial fraud via simulated phishing email attacks (Phase I). A comprehensive in-lab assessment of cognitive/socioemotional and neurophysiological mechanisms will follow (Phase II and III, respectively). A data-analytic Phase IV will integrate data collected across Phases I-III using statistical and machine-learning methods. This multidisciplinary approach, encompassing psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and engineering will lay the foundation for building an integrated approach to risk detection and the provision of financial decision-making supports in older adulthood. Findings and methodologies developed as part of this project have the potential to inform real-life decision-supportive interventions that adopt an age-targeted approach towards the long-term goal of financial risk reduction in older individuals. Project Narrative A rapidly aging population means that financial deception of the aged is an emerging public health problem that requires surveillance and intervention. An increasingly common form of financial fraud is conducted online as older adults more and more manage their assets online. The project goal is to determine cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological risk factors for financial deception in older adults and validate risk assessment and develop detection tools toward a long-term goal of identifying individuals who are particularly susceptible to financial fraud and facilitating prevention and decision-supportive intervention efforts.",Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging,9523024,R01AG057764,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'American', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Deception', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Educational Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Foundations', 'Fraud', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Structure', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Transact', 'Validation', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cyber security', 'decision-making capacity', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'financial decision making', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'learning strategy', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'phishing', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2018,328606,0.16381434974478587
"Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] needed for older adults to maintain optimal physical function is unknown. Institute of Medicine and Endocrine Society have publicly debated on 20 ng/mL or 30 ng/mL, respectively, as targets for skeletal health, but both groups agree that stronger evidence is needed to identify target concentrations for extra-skeletal outcomes, e.g., falls and physical function. The problem is significant: >25% of older adults have poor physical function, 50% have 25(OH)D concentrations between 20 and 30 ng/mL. Identifying 25(OH)D targets for older adults will have immediate impact by informing design and analysis of vitamin D supplementation trials. Namely, targets serve as inclusion/exclusion criteria or baseline subgroups and as secondary outcomes. Our solution is to empirically identify and validate sex-specific (possibly stratified by other factors; e.g., race, genetic variants) 25(OH)D targets in older adults (= 65 years) related to lowe risk of falls and better physical function using existing NIH-funded datasets. A critical challenge is that 25(OH)D cannot be randomized; therefore observational data are a crucial part of the solution. Conventional statistical methods are ill-equipped for this problem; thus, we will develop novel statistical methods by adapting and refining structural modeling and machine-learning methods, and apply them to our aims. We will carry out the aims using 4 prospective cohort studies comprising >12,500 older adults: Health, Aging, and Body Composition, Invecchiare in Chianti, Osteoporotic Fractures in Men, and Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. We will: 1) identify and validate 25(OH)D targets for falls reduction, mobility, activities of daily living, and instrumental activities of daily living (functional outcomes); and gait speed, muscle strength, and frailty (proximal conditions) (aim 1); 2) characterize the joint impact of 25(OH)D and serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations on functional outcomes/proximal conditions (aim 2); and 3) quantify mediation of 25(OH)D on functional outcomes/proximal conditions by endocrine and metabolic factors (PTH, serum alkaline phosphatase, aklotho, fibroblast growth factor 23) (aim 3). We will write code in SAS and R statistical languages and disseminate it to the scientific community for use in additional research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aging of the population is expected to lead to an increased burden of poor physical function and loss of independence. Low concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] are common in older adults and may be one reason for deficits in physical function. Since 25(OH)D can easily be increased by sunlight exposure, diet, and supplements; identifying and validating a target 25(OH)D for functional outcomes in older adults can have a significant impact on public health.",Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults,9260731,R01AG048069,"['25-hydroxyvitamin D', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Body mass index', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Elderly', 'Endocrine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gait speed', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Living', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intake', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'PTH gene', 'Phosphorus', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Sun Exposure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D supplementation', 'Woman', 'Writing', 'analytical method', 'bone', 'bone health', 'calcium intake', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic variant', 'inclusion criteria', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sarcopenia', 'secondary analysis', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'skeletal', 'ultraviolet']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2018,320160,0.12305412919844659
"Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease Resubmission 1 R01 AG058687-01 PI: Adriana Seelye, Ph.D. Project Summary. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease and their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and to reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. Project Objectives. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to objectively assess high-level IADL functioning in a new way that will more effectively identify the earliest subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence. The specific aims for this research are: Aim 1 will establish the most robust remotely monitored IADL variables and combinations of variables to discriminate between MCI and intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC using cross-sectional analyses. Aim 2 will determine the discriminatory ability of the new remotely monitored IADL variables compared to available IADL questionnaires to differentiate those with MCI relative to those with intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC in cross-sectional analyses. Aim 3 will identify and characterize the longitudinal trajectories (slopes) of remotely monitored IADL functioning over time between those with intact cognition and those with MCI using generalized linear mixed effects models, with person-specific IADL distributions and their changes as outcomes. Project Methods. The proposed project will apply innovative computing and ambient sensing technologies directly in participants' home and community environments to objectively assess IADL performance and variability among older adults with and without MCI in multiple clinically relevant functional domains for up to 4 years. Study involvement will also include annual neuropsychological and clinical testing. Machine learning computational approaches will be used to examine a large number of sensor-based IADL candidate variables generated through this study to determine the relative importance of these variables for discriminating between MCI and intact cognition groups, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Project Impact. The approaches used in this study will allow researchers, physicians, and caregivers to proactively identify and monitor increasing risks for deteriorating cognitive function (progressing from normal aging to MCI and from MCI to AD) in a way that is not currently possible, transforming AD prevention trials and significantly reducing the cost and consequences of functional decline in our aging population. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease, their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults with who are at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and the reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to assess day-to-day functioning in a new way which will more effectively identify the subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence.",Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease,9612858,R01AG058687,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caregivers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Prevention', 'Prevention trial', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'disease diagnosis', 'functional decline', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'normal aging', 'pre-clinical', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'time use']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,565060,-0.009439915675117434
"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9496395,R01DA045705,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alprazolam', 'American', 'American Medical Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Baby Booms', 'Beer', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elderly', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicare', 'Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Portraits', 'Poverty', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Dependence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'beneficiary', 'benzodiazepine misuse', 'care providers', 'clinical candidate', 'cohort', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indicated prevention', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'older patient', 'overdose risk', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'selective prevention', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,618216,0.1464981257538209

"Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place SUMMARY This proposal is for an NLM sponsored K01 Mentored Career Development Award. The research I propose involves the development of a smart mobile application combined with commercially available sensors, to capture actionable information about behavior pattern changes in both patients with dementia and their primary caregivers. Through continuously collected physiological sensor data, I will build data models that can learn the behavior patterns of both the patient with dementia and his/her caregiver. My research plan involves three stages. The first stage involves instrument validation and generating context-specific ground truth or the baseline for each participating couple. The second stage will involve longitudinal observational study using the system built in the first stage in an assisted living facility. The final stage will involve deploying our system for a longitudinal study in the homes of our participants. This study merges well with my short term goals to learn more about the challenges faced by older adults as they battle physical and cognitive decline. As a computer science researcher, my long term goal is to work on building technologies that allow older couples to live independently in their homes for a longer time, and to have more control over their quality of life. I have experience working in eldercare research as a part of my doctoral studies in University of Missouri's Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology. I plan to continue working in this field and develop my independent research program that facilitates aging in place through the use of low cost sensors and machine learning analytics. Currently as an Instructor and Research Assistant Professor at Wright State University's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I have strong mentors both in the technical and clinical areas that will allow me to grow in this highly interdisciplinary area. My career development plan includes coursework, regular meetings with mentors and collaborators, and practical clinical study experience that will facilitate my development of an independent research program that will enrich and improve the lives of older adults for years to come. NARRATIVE With the spread of smartphones and wearable sensors in the fitness industry, there is a great opportunity for personalized digital health, especially for chronic conditions like dementia. As an increasing cohort of older adults suffer from dementia, there arises a strong need to extract relevant patient symptoms collected using sensors to provide actionable information for timely intervention. The objective of this application is to map data collected from physiological sensors with the behavior patterns of persons with dementia, as well as the caregiver to understand the physiological changes associated with behavior changes to facilitate early intervention through timely alerts to clinicians.",Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place,9553862,K01LM012439,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Community Health', 'Couples', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instructor', 'instrument', 'learned behavior', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile application', 'multisensory', 'primary caregiver', 'professor', 'programs', 'recruit', 'rehabilitation technology', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'support tools', 'trait', 'usability', 'wearable device', 'web app']",NLM,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,171298,0.08735207187197944
"Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in older adults (≥65y) is rising, and there is limited evidence-based guidance on treating these older adults. In older patients with multi-morbidity, treatment decisions should factor in not only risk of disease complications, but also treatment complications and non-IBD, extra-intestinal complications. Hence, to inform optimal treatment approach, a comprehensive assessment of comparative effects of different therapies on all of these outcomes is warranted. Existing single-center observational studies are limited by small sample size, and missing data due to fragmented health care, whereas administrative claims-based studies are limited by lack of detailed clinical data; these limitations can be overcome by linking the two data sources. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Siddharth Singh proposes to: (Aim #1.1) characterize disease burden and treatment patterns, (Aim #1.2) assess and predict risks of death, disease, treatment and extra-intestinal complications using machine-learning algorithms and (Aim #2.1) compare overall effectiveness and (Aim #2.2) safety of different treatment strategies in older patients with IBD. This will be studied using a highly innovative informatics-based approach in a multi-site, electronic medical record (EMR)-based cohort of older patients with IBD, linked to their corresponding Medicare claims. The EMR-based cohort will facilitate phenotyping and disease severity assessment, and linkage to Medicare claims will augment exposure and outcome ascertainment, overcoming challenges of fragmentation of healthcare and short follow-up. The central hypothesis is that, that older adults have systematically different risk profiles than younger adults, and using biologic monotherapy is a safer and more effective approach to treating IBD, as compared to using long-term corticosteroids alone, non-biologic immunomodulator monotherapy, and combination therapy of biologics and immunomodulators. The access to the advanced infrastructure of pSCANNER (Patient-centered Scalable National Network for Effectiveness Research), one of 13 PCORI-funded Clinical Data Research Networks, and entire Medicare database, in a highly supportive and conducive environment at UCSD, with cross-disciplinary mentorship by a collaborative and experienced team of mentors and advisors from diverse backgrounds (clinical informatics, comparative effectiveness research, IBD therapeutics) is a key strength of this application. Besides directly informing clinical practice on treatment approaches in older patients with IBD, this proposal will enhance the career of the candidate by providing unique skills in applied clinical informatics, privacy-preserving record linkage techniques, predictive analytics, and comparative effectiveness research, and create a multi-institutional, EMR- based cohort of well-characterized IBD patients, linked with Medicare claims. This will ultimately contribute to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career focusing on comparative effectiveness research and population health management using novel informatics-based approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The information on comparative effectiveness and safety of different therapies in the context of patients' risk profile generated using this novel informatics-based approach in a unique linked EMR-Medicare database, will directly inform treatment of older patients with IBD, and enhance comparative effectiveness research methods.",Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,9505175,K23DK117058,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunomodulators', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Steroids', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Thromboembolism', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health management', 'high risk', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optimal treatments', 'patient oriented', 'personalized medicine', 'population health', 'risk minimization', 'skills', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K23,2018,203872,0.09394590394893765
"Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study Project Summary Over 100 million Americans will be over age 65 years by 2060 (representing 25% of the U.S. population), with an increasing proportion of African-Americans. Understanding which Americans exhibit “exceptionally healthy aging”—an older life free of illness, disability, or functional limitation—is central to efforts to improve quality of life and resource utilization. Current investigations on “healthy aging” focus on systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-6) or composite indices of organ/metabolic function (the “healthy aging index,” HAI), both lim- ited by a (1) lack of sensitivity for early changes in metabolism; (2) lack of specificity for molecular pathways involved in these changes; (3) absence of investigation early in adulthood (when “aging” may be reversible); (4) few studies of African-Americans, at high-risk for age-related morbidity. In preparation for this application, we applied metabolite profiling in a pilot study of nearly 300 African-American males in Health ABC, a biracial NIA study of elderly Caucasians and African-Americans, identifying metabolites associated with HAI (oxidative stress, nitric oxide signaling, gut microbial metabolism), some of which may be unique to African-Americans. Here, we hypothesize that circulating metabolites associated with multi-dimensional aging phenotypes and outcomes in older adults will define pathways of “exceptional healthy aging” that may be race-specific and dysregulated in youth at risk for “premature” aging. To address this hypothesis, we will harness two well- characterized, biracial American cohorts that span life (elderly: age 73±3 N=1312; young: CARDIA, age 32±4 N=2376; R01-HL136541). In Aim 1, we define metabolic pathways implicated in race-specific healthy aging, based on association between metabolites and validated age-related phenotypes heterogeneous by race (physical, neurocognitive function, vascular structure, body composition). We will assess determinants of iden- tified pathways, including dietary quality, physical activity, and psychosocial stress (poorer in African- Americans). In Aim 2, we identify metabolites related to “exceptionally healthy aging” in the elderly (freedom from disability, dementia, cancer, cardiovascular disease), their pathways, race-specificity, and overlap with pathways identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we apply machine-learning techniques to metabolites to derive a classi- fier for exceptionally healthy aging in Health ABC and apply this prediction rule to young adults in CARDIA to identify young adults at risk for unhealthy aging. We then investigate whether individuals marked for premature aging develop adverse aging phenotypes decades later (neurocognitive, physical, vascular, clinical outcome). This proposal addresses a core mission of the NIA (directly responsive to PA-17-088) by defining a metabolic basis for “exceptional healthy aging” across race and at the extremes of life. We leverage rich phenotypes within Health ABC, funded efforts within CARDIA, and a team experienced in aging epidemiology, metabolic research, and data science approaches. Successful completion of this project will furnish a rich molecular phe- notypic resource to the aging community for investigation of mechanisms and biomarkers of biological aging. Project Narrative Nearly 100 million Americans will be >65 years by 2060. Current clinical-biochemical metrics of aging do not capture accelerated aging, specifically the clinical observation that African Americans are at especially high risk of age-related morbidity. Here, we perform metabolite profiling in the Health ABC study to identify metabolic pathways central to healthy aging across race and examine these pathways in a separate longitudinal study of young adults (CARDIA), redefining aging as a systemic metabolic disease impacting function and outcomes in Caucasian and African-Americans across life.",Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study,9576319,R01AG059729,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caucasians', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Diet', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Freedom', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Premature aging syndrome', 'Preparation', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'ST14 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'biracial', 'caucasian American', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'disability', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fitness', 'healthy aging', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'male', 'mental state', 'microbial', 'middle age', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sarcopenia', 'walking speed', 'young adult']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,427901,0.056875536236769574
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9559625,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2018,156568,0.11217519482963846
"Improving patient and caregiver engagement through the application of data science methods to audio recorded clinic visits stored in personal health libraries PROJECT SUMMARY    Forty to eighty percent of clinic visit information is forgotten by patients immediately post visit, a significant  barrier to self-­management leading to poor health outcomes. Visit summaries can improve recall, yet patient

"A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults Abstract  People aged 65+ will represent 21% of the U.S. population and increase to about 80 million by 2040, and the oldest old (age 85+) will number ~ 14.1 million. Population aging presents both opportunities and challenges for our healthcare, the economy, and existing social support systems. Many older adults especially the oldest old, minorities and those of lower Socio-Economic status (SES) are particularly vulnerable to social isolation, poor diet, and decreased levels of physical activity each of which influence morbidity and mortality. Mobile-based, tablet-based, and in-home technologies provide an excellent opportunity for projecting behavior- change interventions and social support into the everyday life of older adults at great economies of scale. The objectives of this study are to examine the usability and efficacy, for diverse older adults, of a new tablet-based dynamic system: the Fittle Senior System (FSS) that will provide: (1) personalized behavior-change programs for improved diet and increased physical activity and (2) online social interaction and support from small teams pursuing similar goals. The system builds on two technology-based systems developed by the investigative team: (1) the computer-based PRISM system, designed for older populations to support social connectivity and well-being, and (2) the Fittle+ mobile platform designed to support positive health behavior change through integrated online social support and personalized coaching based on artificial intelligence (AI). The study will be conducted in two phases. During Phase 1 we will develop and pilot test the FSS with representative samples of older adults. Phase 2 will involve a two group randomized trial where participants will be randomized to the Fittle Senior System (FSS, an adaptive coaching and social support system using mobile technology) or to a paper-based psycho-educational (BPE) control condition following a baseline assessment. The duration of the intervention phase will involve an active 12-week intervention phase followed by a 12-week maintenance phase. We will recruit and randomize 180 community dwelling adults aged 65+ years, who live alone and are at risk for social isolation (90 per condition - 30 White Caucasians, 30 Black/African Americans and 30 Hispanic Americans). We will recruit males and females commensurate to the gender proportions represented in this age group and work to ensure that we have sufficient representation from the “oldest old” cohort. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3mths post active intervention and 3mths post maintenance (6mths following active intervention) on clinically significant measures of health and health behaviors and indices of social support. We will also gather information on potential moderating (e.g., ethnicity, age) and mediating variables (e.g., health self-efficacy), which will be examined using multilevel modeling techniques guided by current theories of behavior change and technology acceptance and use among older adults. Project Narrative This proposed project is addressing a critical public concern. The population is aging and chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are common among older adults especially ethnic minorities. This study will develop and evaluate a mobile technology-based intervention designed to support positive health behavior change among diverse older adults through integrated online social support, personalized coaching and goal setting.",A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults,9708683,R01AG053163,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caucasians', 'Chronic', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Industry', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Jordan', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Older Population', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Self Efficacy', 'Social Interaction', 'Social isolation', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Support System', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'active method', 'age group', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinically significant', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'dynamic system', 'education research', 'efficacy trial', 'ethnic minority population', 'family structure', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'low socioeconomic status', 'male', 'medical schools', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'nutrition', 'programs', 'psychoeducational', 'psychoeducational intervention', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2018,589098,0.12250430798267131
"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,9355893,R01NR016423,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Gait', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'active control', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'fitness', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'improved', 'information display', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'preference', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'walking speed', 'wearable device']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2018,92000,0.05785451971571519
"Working Memory Training in Older Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that cognitive interventions targeting working memory are beneficial in that they show generalizing effects that go beyond what has been specifically trained, i.e. transfer effects. Although it seems more difficult to observe such transfer effects in older adults as compared to young adults or children, we and others have found that some interventions do show promise in older populations. Despite the promising results, more research is needed to make our interventions more effective and more robust, and to uncover the underlying mechanisms of training in an aging population. For our proposed studies, we envision two lines of research with different goals: First, we aim to address questions of pragmatics. Our goal here is to make our intervention more accessible and inviting for participants, thus increasing their motivation to participate effectively in training regimens. In addition, we will investigate the intervention's optimal scheduling (i.e., spacing of practice), and explore whether the improvements extend to measures of everyday functioning, and finally, investigate longitudinal effects and their trajectories over the course of one year after training completion. These are our applied goals. Second, we propose to address the most important questions of any intervention research: The investigation of the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms of improvement. Furthermore, we will shed light on individual differences as moderating factors for training success. These are our mechanistic goals. Given the sparse availability of effective cognitive interventions, and the limited knowledge about their generalizing effects to applied measures of daily living, the proposed work will have important implications in that it will shed more light on the mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in old age, and serve as groundwork for future large-scale randomized clinical trials and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The vast majority of our nation's aging population will experience some decline in cognitive function with age. Therefore, the development of effective preventative interventions to mitigate age-related cognitive decline is of critical importance in that those interventions could not only impact older adults' cognitive and daily life functioning, but ultimately, contribute to their well-being and quality of life. The proposed work will have important implications in that it will get at the underlying mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in ld age, and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted cognitive interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia.",Working Memory Training in Older Adults,9507749,R01AG049006,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Financial compensation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Motivation', 'Older Population', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Populations at Risk', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Schedule', 'Self Efficacy', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specificity', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'active control', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'computerized', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow up assessment', 'improved', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success', 'therapy design', 'usability', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2018,618627,0.060416910720712765
"A New Paradigm for Hypertension in the Elderly- Beyond Age DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 60% of adults age � 65 years have high blood pressure (BP), but optimal management of high BP in the elderly remains controversial. Contrary to evidence in middle age that lowering BP is clearly beneficial, data in older adults are inconsistent and high BP may not be a risk factor in all elders. We recently reported that, among participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey age e65 years, high BP was a risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) death only among persons in better health status (defined as fast walking of a 20-ft walk test). In contrast, high BP was not a risk factor among slow walkers. Additionally, the benefit of lowering BP in all elders remains an issue of debate; a recent meta-analysis in persons age 80 years and older reported no benefit of BP treatment on mortality, and significant heterogeneity across trials. Finally, there is growin concern for potential harms associated with treatment to lower BP. Excessive lowering of BP, particularly diastolic, has been associated with increased risk for death and cardiovascular events in some studies. In the proposed research, we propose a novel paradigm where the associations of BP with adverse outcomes in older persons are considered in the setting of the complex aging process. Our long-term goal is to reliably identify elderly persons in whom BP treatment is beneficial and those in whom treatment is ineffective or even harmful, by defining subpopulations of similar health status. Specifically, aim 1 proposes to elucidate factors from four domains (functional, cognitive/mental, self-rated health, and physiologic) that can identify elderly persons in whom high systolic BP is strongly associated with higher risk for death and CV events, and those in whom it is not, using data from three NIH-funded cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) and Sacramento Area Latino Study of Aging (SALSA). In aim 2, we will evaluate the role of diastolic BP across level of health status. Finally, based on findings from these observational cohorts, in aim 3 we will evaluate whether these factors can identify elderly persons in whom treatment to lower BP is of maximum benefit in two randomized controlled trials: the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly (SHEP) and the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3). Since participants in trials are healthier than the U.S. population, we will also evaluate the effect of treatment in the observational studies, using state-of-the-art causal inference methods, which can correct for the bias of standard analytic approaches. Completion of these aims will substantially advance our understanding of the importance of high BP in older adults; will improve our ability to identify elderly persons who will benefit from BP treatment; will allow a systematic understanding of groups in whom evidence for BP treatment is lacking; and will guide design of future trials of hypertension in elderly adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Treatment of high blood pressure in elderly persons remains controversial. This proposal focuses on developing systematic methods to understand which elderly persons benefit from lowering blood pressure. This question is of great relevance as U.S. elders are living longer than any prior generation, and the majority have high blood pressure.",A New Paradigm for Hypertension in the Elderly- Beyond Age,9402033,R01AG046206,"['Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Latino', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walkers', 'Walking', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'evidence base', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'systolic hypertension', 'treatment effect']",NIA,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2018,312569,0.07909868329038004
"Robot-Assisted Cognitive Training for Socially Isolated Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) to provide cognitive training, in the form of learning to play the piano, to improve cognitive functioning and reduce feelings of loneliness in socially-isolated older adults. The SAR will administer cognitive training via guided practice on a set of standard piano lesson tasks designed to reflect particular cognitive functions: memory, attention, language, and social acuity. The goals of this project are that the SAR will (1) engage the persons with mild cognitive impairment (PMCI) in skill-building cognitive music training; (2) enhance cognitive functioning, in particular verbal and visual memory, reasoning ability, and complex attention; and (3) reduce feelings of loneliness. This SAR can be used as both a personalized social companion and an interactive tutor to deliver customized training for cognitive functioning and social engagement. We have assembled a strong multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, roboticists, engineers, human factors specialists, neuroscientists, and gerontologists, well suited to achieve goals. Project Narrative Dementia is a costly chronic disease; an estimated $259 billion was spent in 2017 for health care, long-term care, and out-of-pocket expenses. Furthermore, social isolation is a problem many older adults face, with 1 in 3 older adults reporting loneliness in the United States. Socially assistive robotics (SARs) have the potential to provide mental and social engagement – especially for those older adults who may lack social connections. In particular, SARs can utilize machine learning to provide customized and socially-engaging cognitive training for lonely older adults with MCI.",Robot-Assisted Cognitive Training for Socially Isolated Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment,9620766,R42AG060800,"['Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Esthetics', 'Face', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Loneliness', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Music', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Reporting', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social Concepts', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Specialist', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Uninsured Medical Expense', 'United States', 'aged', 'body language', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive training', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'preference', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'robot assistance', 'robot interface', 'sensory integration', 'skills', 'social', 'social engagement', 'tutoring', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'visual memory', 'web app']",NIA,APPLIED UNIVERSAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION,R42,2018,347146,0.09976693212436437
"Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality Abstract Older adults struggle to engage in health enhancing physical activity (PA) and spend up to 11 hours a day sitting. Older women, in particular, are at increased risk of chronic disease and disability, and use a high proportion of healthcare resources. Improving both these behaviors has promise for improving several salient aging outcomes, but evidence to inform guidelines on how best to interrupt long periods of sedentary behavior (SB) are lacking. Few laboratory-based trials have included adults over 70 years old, have focused on PA to interrupt SB, and have not tested standing breaks that might be acceptable to older adults. A recent review showed that in the real world, traditional PA interventions do not meaningfully impact SB. In contrast, interventions that focus on standing can reduce SB, up to 2 hours per day. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between self-reported SB and increased risks of death and metabolic outcomes, but very few prospective studies have employed objective measures of SB. Although accelerometer measures can indicate the intensity of movement or lack of it, traditional cutpoints do not accurately classify behaviors such as sitting, standing or walking. While pilot intervention studies, using thigh worn inclinometers, have demonstrated that SB can be greatly reduced, there are no RCTs in older adults with health outcomes. There is much room for improvement in our understanding of SB and healthy aging. The National Institute on Aging conducted a summer workshop series to address this issue in 2013. We have therefore designed a Program project – Sedentary Time and Aging Research (STAR) – to provide more rigorous and comprehensive evidence on how to interrupt sitting time and the consequences for healthy aging. In particular, we are proposing a paradigm shift away from energy expenditure as the primary mechanism for health outcomes to investigating behaviors such as brief sit-to-stand transitions that expend little energy but engage muscles, improve postural blood flow, and may impact physical functioning in older adults. Further, we will study a broader range of outcomes than investigated to date, including targeted novel mechanisms important for healthy aging. The STAR program will include 3 Projects and 2 Cores for study of postmenopausal women at risk for chronic disease. STAR includes 2 randomized trials, in the laboratory (N=86) and in the real world (N=592), with focus on optimizing new computational techniques to apply to existing prospective accelerometer data (n>6000). All projects will investigate the consequences of extended sitting, standing, brief sit-to-stand transitions and PA breaks on mechanisms of healthy aging including glucose regulation, endothelial functioning, and mitochondrial functioning. We will also investigate physical functioning, blood pressure and in Project 3, 5-7 year mortality risk. All Projects will compare effects across age groups. STAR will provide a comprehensive evidence base that can inform public health guidelines on SB and aging. We will coordinate our efforts with a new American Heart Association Center on SB and Latinas.  Narrative Sitting time may be particularly bad for the health of older women. This program grant will provide new and improved evidence to help the public understand how to interrupt sitting in ways that support healthy aging.  ","Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality",9519753,P01AG052352,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Computational Technique', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Latina', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Mitochondria', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Postmenopause', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'age effect', 'age group', 'attentional control', 'base', 'behavior observation', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'disability', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older women', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'response biomarker', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'young adult']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",P01,2018,1880890,0.06235700772360702
"Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults (AD/ADRD-Focused Administrative Supplement) Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults: AD/ADRD-Focused  Administrative Supplement Summary Dementia affects over 5 million older adults in the US, with vast implications for individual patients, their caregivers, and social programs designed to support increasing health care needs. Research to date has not fully clarified the role that multiple co-occurring chronic conditions (multimorbidity) play in the provision of appropriate care for racially and ethnically diverse groups of older adults with mild or more severe cognitive impairment. As a result, there is a need for greater understanding of the complex interactions between existing morbidity combinations, cognitive impairment, and the receipt of essential and appropriate care. As of yet, it is unclear whether specific multimorbidity combinations alongside cognitive impairment present greater difficulty in accessing good-quality, and appropriate care and preventive services among older adults from underrepresented racial/ethnic backgrounds. The supplement extends from the research conducted in the parent award by focusing on older adults with cognitive impairment or dementia and co-existing chronic conditions. The goal of this supplement is to evaluate racial and ethnic differences in the quality of care received for older adults with dementia and competing multimorbidity care demands. We propose to use existing databases and multimorbidity combinations and patterns recently found in the parent grant. Our proposed research employs data from over 20 years of nationally-representative biennial surveys (~38,000 sampled people in the Health & Retirement Study) linked to Medicare claims. We propose two aims:  Aim 1. Determine racial and ethnic differences in receipt of preventive services among older adults with  mild or severe cognitive impairment and various multimorbidity combinations.  Aim 2. Evaluate racial and ethnic differences in potentially avoidable hospital admissions and  emergency department (ED) visits with discharge among older adults with mild or severe cognitive  impairment and various multimorbidity patterns. Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults: AD/ADRD-Focused  Administrative Supplement Narrative Our findings will inform policies and programs that seek to delay and avert costly and intensive levels of care among racially/ethnically diverse older adults with dementia. By identifying disease combinations with dementia associated with poor uptake of preventive services and high use of preventable hospital and emergency department services, future work can inform treatment decision-making and practice guidelines that are better attuned to the needs of vulnerable older adults with mild and severe cognitive decline.",Changes in Multimorbidity and Disability Among Race/Ethnic Older Adults (AD/ADRD-Focused Administrative Supplement),9716886,R01AG055681,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Departments', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Institutionalization', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare claim', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preventive service', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Surveys', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'care systems', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic difference', 'ethnic diversity', 'health care service utilization', 'health related quality of life', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'parent grant', 'premature', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'racial diversity', 'sex', 'social', 'tool', 'trend', 'uptake']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,373593,0.16910965042124682
"High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression Project Summary/Abstract: Depression (target disease of this proposal) affects 34 million Americans including 2 million seniors per year. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (target population of this proposal). The vascular depression hypothesis (proposed in 1998) remains the most salient theory explaining the onset and perpetuation of depression in older adults. This model is based on the observation that in older adults, white matter hyperintensities (a hallmark of small vessel disease, SVD) are associated with depression onset and perpetuation. Progress in understanding the relationship of small vessel disease with late-life depression has been stymied in part by lack of specificity of white matter hyperintensities which can represent components of edema, gliosis, ischemia, and inflammation. Traditional MR imaging is unable to distinguish between these components, and thus the specific mechanisms that contribute to depression remain unclear.  The emergence of ultrahigh field MR imaging allows for greater specificity of the WMH lesions, and other components of small vessel disease. Bringing 7 tesla (T) imaging into mainstream clinical use will be accomplished through 1) having exclusive (over 1.5/3T) application(s) and 2) achieving robust, safe, consistent, and homogenous high-quality images. Through a consortium consisting of experts at University of Pittsburgh combined with collaboration at FDA, University of Minnesota, and Quality Electrodynamics Inc., our goal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. We will achieve this goal through the development of robust radiofrequency methodology, as well as pulse sequences that produce 7T images with the aforementioned necessary attributes. This will be paired with complementary 3T MRI at baseline. We will use our recently developed (as well as a proposed) custom designed 7T radiofrequency coil system and pulse sequences that are already being used in disease/patient studies. Based on our preliminary results, the proposed RF solution will provide unprecedented homogeneity and consistency among different subjects/patients, and therefore excellent signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio for detection of components of small vessel disease. The study will examine two cohorts 1) a group of 30 older adults recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) for developing an MRI to histopathology statistical model of SVD and 2) 60 older adults with late-life depression who will undergo scanning at baseline and after 2 years. The longitudinal 7T MRI and SVD model will be used to help characterize the small vessel changes associated with depression in older adults.  In summary, this study develops an emerging and timely technology (high-performance ultrahigh field MRI) to study a critical pathophysiological process (cerebral small vessel disease) in a clinically relevant population (Late-Life Depression). This project will further advance all of these three domains. Project Narrative: The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. This will be accomplished through the development of radiofrequency hardware, methodology, pulse sequences and protocols using 7 Tesla (T) human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in conjunction with complimentary 3T MRI. The clinical relevance of the proposed tools will be achieved through comprehensive characterization of 1) components of cerebral small vessel disease in individuals with late-life depression and 2) progression of small vessel disease markers over 2 years. One of our overarching goals is to achieve a highly useful 7T clinical utility, which requires high quality, robust, and consistent acquisitions.

"Technology-Enabled Therapy for Elders with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Co-morbid Insomnia Abstract Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often viewed as a transitional stage between normal aging and early stage of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia. MCI affects up to 20% of the population of older adults, and sleep disturbances have been identified as one of the core neuropsychiatric problems in MCI. Sleep disturbances are associated with a range of negative outcomes for persons with MCI, including worsening cognitive function, physical function, depression, and fatigue, which can all lead to functional impairments that greatly reduce quality of life. One of the most common sleep disturbances in persons with MCI is insomnia, with a prevalence of 44%. While non-pharmacological treatments, especially in-person cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI), have demonstrated clinical efficacy in improving sleep and preserving cognitive function in the general population of older adults, there have been few studies focused on adapting CBTI for older adults with MCI.  The goal of this SBIR Phase I is to develop and test a provider-supported, technology-enabled system to adapt and deliver evidence-based CBTI to persons with MCI and co-morbid insomnia, with the support of health providers. The proposed intervention combines internet/mobile-based delivery and smart messaging prompts as reminders to compensate for cognitive processes that can be impaired in MCI. Specific aims for this Phase I include: (1) Develop a technology-enabled system to deliver CBTI for older adults with MCI; (2) Conduct formative evaluations with persons with MCI to refine smart messaging prompts and test usability of the patient software platform, and cognitive interviews with providers to assess feasibility of implementing the intervention in the clinical setting; and (3) Conduct a six-week pilot randomized controlled trial to assess preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of the CBTI intervention. We hypothesize that participants in the CBTI intervention group will demonstrate a significant improvement in quality of sleep (both subjective and objective), and an improvement in cognitive and physical functioning, compared to those in the control group.  Data collected in Phase I will be used to determine the sample size necessary for an adequately powered Phase II randomized trial. If successful, this product will contribute to the adoption and dissemination of a low-cost, multi-technology enabled CBTI intervention to reduce sleep disturbances, and improve cognitive and physical function among persons with MCI. A successful Phase II study will result in a technology-enabled program that can benefit multiple types of provider organizations (mental health clinics, primary care clinics, and geriatric clinics) serving large numbers of older adults with MCI, thus having significant commercial potential. Narrative More than 5 million people in the United States suffer from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), with over 44% of them experiencing insomnia. Given the negative outcomes associated with MCI and co-morbid insomnia, there is strong interest in developing non-pharmacological treatments for improving sleep in this population of older adults. The proposed project provides a technology-enabled system that is designed to adapt cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) for older adults with MCI. Combining emerging innovative technologies with evidence-based practice, the proposed CBTI intervention system has the potential to be deployed by multiple provider organizations, including mental health clinics, primary care clinics, geriatric clinics, and home care agencies, potentially benefiting millions of older adults in the U.S. who have MCI and co-morbid sleep problems.",Technology-Enabled Therapy for Elders with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Co-morbid Insomnia,9622670,R43AG058334,"['Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Columbidae', 'Communication', 'Comorbid Insomnia', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Eagles', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Evidence based practice', 'Fatigue', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Home Care Agencies', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modification', 'Motivation', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Sample Size', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical efficacy', 'cloud based', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'cost', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'formative assessment', 'functional disability', 'group intervention', 'human old age (65+)', 'hypnotic', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'normal aging', 'older patient', 'phase 2 study', 'preference', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'sleep onset', 'sleep quality', 'software systems', 'treatment response', 'usability']",NIA,"ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH GROUP, INC.",R43,2018,224844,0.019321098788475745
"Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is a stigmatized, underreported, under-diagnosed, under-treated yet common condition that negatively impacts quality of life of many older adults. UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI. The long-term goal is to design innovative clinical trials to mitigate and prevent UUI and UTI in older men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine accompanied by a strong and urgent desire to urinate and is associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTI), the second most frequent infection among older adults. UUI is extremely common among older men and women and current treatments are not successful in most patients. The Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use an existing racially/ethnically diverse and clinically well-characterized cohort to investigate the association of current UUI status and future UTI with risk factors, both established (e.g., obesity and diabetes) and novel (i.e., vitamin D and the urinary microbiome) and create prediction models that identify individuals at high risk for UUI and UTI.

"Web-based App to Alleviate Loneliness and Isolation in Older Adults at Home ABSTRACT Loneliness contributes to physical and psychological chronic illnesses, functional decline and mortality in older adults. The fast-growing older population coupled with the worsening shortage of caregivers will soon present our nation with severe societal and economic challenges. Older adults often struggle to maintain quality of life and independence in the presence of chronic diseases and isolation. Socialization has been shown to reduce chronic disease, depression, and to improve quality of life in older adults. Motivation and feedback are essential to continued engagement but doing so through the traditional manner of in-person coaching can be prohibitively expensive. Vigorous Mind (VM) has been providing a web-based platform to promote sustained engagement of older adults primarily in groups in senior living facilities. The platform provides dynamic and tailored content for group activities including reminiscence activities, favorite music and video, adaptive computer games and communication. A new mobile app will be developed to enable older adults at home to connect and participate in group activities in senior centers and independent senior living communities. With the help of the Consortium on Technology for Proactive Care, we will enhance the current VM system with a health coach with automated tailored messaging and incentives for continued engagement and adherence. This will optimize the VM system for home-based deployment, thus expanding the reach and impact of VM to potentially delay or even prevent institutionalization among older adults living independently. There is a compelling need for a tool that can alleviate loneliness and increase older adults’ socialization to reduce chronic disease, depression and decline and to improve quality of life in this fast-growing population. The proposed integrated web-based platform represents the first step in the development of environments that combine human and machine intelligence in order to facilitate socialization for older adults and to enhance their quality of life.",Web-based App to Alleviate Loneliness and Isolation in Older Adults at Home,9678301,R43AG061928,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Hearing', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Independent Living', 'Institutionalization', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Local Government', 'Loneliness', 'Mental Depression', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Music', 'Older Population', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Rewards', 'Services', 'Site', 'Socialization', 'State Government', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'community living', 'computer game', 'design', 'functional decline', 'improved', 'instructor', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'tailored messaging', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,"VIGOROUS MIND, INC.",R43,2018,220511,0.19942051392906768
"Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding and Monitoring System (MEDSReM) Abstract for Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding and Monitoring System (MEDSReM) Hypertension is prevalent among older adults. Hypertension increases risk for stroke and myocardial infarction, and can result in end organ damage to the kidneys, retina and brain. Medication adherence is critically important to prevent the deleterious effects of hypertension; yet, adherence is often calculated at only 50%. We developed and tested the Multifaceted Prospective Memory Intervention (MPMI), a behavioral intervention, using theories of prospective memory and aging to improve adherence to antihypertensive medications. The MPMI was tested among older adults (≥ 65 years of age) and improved adherence by 35%. The MPMI was efficacious over the short term, but after an additional 5 months without the ongoing presence of the interventionists, adherence declined. The purpose of the current study is to create an evidence-based smartphone application and companion website in order to provide continuous use of the efficacious strategies to sustain adherence. We are at an exciting time since among persons with hypertension the potential benefits of improved health can be achieved through improved adherence. The recent SPRINT study (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) supports improved outcomes (lower fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause) by targeting a lower systolic blood pressure of 120 mm Hg compared to using the previously recommended guideline of 140 mm Hg.2 These outcomes will not be achieved unless we can help people take their medications as prescribed and as intended. Specifically using iterative usability, cognitive walk-through and heuristic evaluation, we will build, test and modify a mobile application (App) and companion website, the Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding and Monitoring System (MEDSReM). Mobile devices are ubiquitous and can be leveraged to capture the prospective memory strategies and improve adherence. The development of the MEDSReM will be based on the strategies from the MPMI, human factors in aging, preferences, needs and requirements of older adults taking medications using technology and iterative testing to assure usability for older adults. The strategies will be translated to technology and add decision support. Decision support will provide the patient with assistance in taking medications if they have missed a dose. A decision tree will be created with knowledge of pharmacotherapeutic and pharmacokinetics based on the patient's medication time to peak, duration and half-life properties to determine a safe interval for taking missed doses. The final MEDSReM will include a website that can easily be accessed with links in the App for educational support and ongoing coaching. Taking a human factors approach to inform the preferences, needs and requirements for technological support to take medications as intended, and iterative testing for usability of the App and website among older adults, will result in a superior product for the mobile App and website and improve health outcomes. This final product will be field tested and consequent improvement in adherence assessed. Public Health Significance High blood pressure is common among older adults and can lead to poor health including the increased likelihood of stroke and heart disease. Adhering to medications that lower blood pressure is difficult, particularly among older adults who have been shown to experience age-associated declines in cognitive processes that could support medication taking. A previously tested intervention was successful in improving adherence. The aim of this study is to translate the intervention into mobile technology with the goal of sustaining good adherence.","Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding and Monitoring System (MEDSReM)",9469571,R21NR016285,"['Adherence', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Companions', 'Consult', 'Cues', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Financial cost', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Half-Life', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Memory Loss', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Self Management', 'Self-Administered', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'blood pressure intervention', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'experience', 'field study', 'handheld mobile device', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'memory process', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'post intervention', 'preference', 'prevent', 'prospective memory', 'prototype', 'smartphone Application', 'software development', 'successful intervention', 'theories', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2018,153500,0.09869502461271949
"Machine learning-based profiles of atherosclerosis to predict disease outcomes in older HIV-infected women and men No abstract available 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE People living with HIV have evidence of accelerated aging; prior studies have typically evaluated isolated outcomes despite the fact that aging is inherently a multifactorial and complex process. We propose to use machine learning methods to develop novel phenotypes of atherosclerosis among HIV-infected women and men, and then determine the utility of these phenotypes by assessing their associations with cardiovascular disease mortality and other age-related clinical and functional outcomes, including traditional “geriatric” outcomes. Our work has the potential to lead to new insights into the role of aging in cardiovascular pathogenesis among HIV-infected adults.",Machine learning-based profiles of atherosclerosis to predict disease outcomes in older HIV-infected women and men,9856243,R21AG060860,[' '],NIA,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R21,2018,175781,0.005634267872106652
"Frailty, Statins, and Cardiovascular Disease Burden in Older Adults Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in older adults. Statins are highly effective cholesterol-lowering medications used for primary prevention of CVD, and are the most commonly prescribed medications. After age 75, data on the effects of statins are limited to guide statin prescribing recommendations. However, even where the evidence is clear, statins remain under-prescribed. Reasons for under-prescribing of proven CVD prevention medications such as statins in older adults are many, and may include competing medical conditions, adverse side effects (e.g., myalgias), and frailty. Frailty is a multidimensional state of decreased physiologic reserve associated with an increased risk of CVD and poor clinical outcomes. The aging population is heterogeneous and a one-size fits all approach may not be appropriate. In particular, understanding the utility of statins for prevention of CVD in individuals who are vulnerable or frail is critical. Therefore, the research activities in this GEMSSTAR award will use a retrospective design to (1) understand patterns of statin use in a large cohort of older US veterans aged 65 and older, over 15 years of follow up, with particular attention to the relationship between frailty, myalgias and statin use; and (2) examine the association between statin use for primary prevention of CVD in pre-frail and frail older veterans and cardiovascular events, health care utilization, and mortality. This work will inform the design of future clinical trials of statins for prevention of CVD in older adults accounting for heterogeneity of aging and frailty. In addition to the pharmacoepidemiologic study proposed, this GEMSSTAR award includes mentorship, coursework, and seminars in advanced epidemiologic and statistical methods, geriatrics, and cardiology. The research and career development activities will prepare the applicant for her long-term goal of a research career in geriatric preventive cardiology and will inform preventive care for the aging population. As the population ages, identifying preventive strategies for heart disease and stroke is a priority. However, proven preventive medications such as the cholesterol-lowering statins remain underused. In this study, we aim to understand patterns of statin use in older adults to shed light on why statins may be underused even where evidence is clear, and to examine whether statins are useful in preventing heart disease and stroke in older adults who are vulnerable or frail.","Frailty, Statins, and Cardiovascular Disease Burden in Older Adults",9589859,R03AG060169,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Event', 'Frail Elderly', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Medical', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myalgia', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive therapy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Probability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Smoking Status', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Veterans', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'aging population', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'male', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'prevent', 'research and development', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R03,2018,96525,0.14407384656306263
"Scriptmate: A patient-centered mobile system for geriatric prescription medication management PROJECT SUMMARY Elderly patients are the largest consumers of prescription and non-prescription medications and have been reported to account for $887 million in treatment costs for medication errors likely due to altered pharmacokinetics, polypharmacy, decline in cognition, and lower health literacy. As a result of this confluence of issues that affect the aging population, medication management tools designed to accommodate the particular needs of older adults can be greatly beneficial. While there have been many advances made in mobile health technologies to assist with aspects of medication management such as adherence reminders and access to drug labeling information, few products are designed to enable facile identification and verification of a patient's prescribed medications. The innovation proposed in this Phase I SBIR addresses this gap in medication management tools designed for older adult patients. We will use a combination of innovative mechanical and software engineering techniques to build the Scriptmate system, which will be designed to assist older adult patients with easy identification and verification of medications using a pill scanner and facilitate medication consolidation, and access to medication information via patient-facing mobile application. The goal of this Phase I SBIR is to assess the feasibility and usability of Scriptmate. Three substudies will be conducted with older adult patients and pharmacists using a user-centered design framework to address the project goal: a formative assessment (N=20), prototype walkthrough interviews (N=10) and one-on-one usability testing sessions (N=10). PROJECT NARRATIVE Patient misunderstanding of prescription medication label instructions has been found to be one of the main root causes of medication errors that can lead to ADEs. While this is an issue that affects patients of all ages, older adult patients with multiple morbidities and complex medication regimens are at greatest risk. Our proposed system, Scriptmate, uses a combination of mechanical and software engineering to directly address a gap in medication management innovations today, allowing older adults to easily identify and verify medications and consolidate medications on a schedule based on key health literacy principles. Results of this project will have implications for the care of aging adults with increasingly complex medication regimens, and potentially for other sub-populations with reduced physical and cognitive abilities.",Scriptmate: A patient-centered mobile system for geriatric prescription medication management,9410102,R43AG057319,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Labeling', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Technology', 'Image', 'Inpatients', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medication Errors', 'Medication Management', 'Medicine', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Older Population', 'Oral', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phase', 'Plant Roots', 'Polypharmacy', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Solid', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'design', 'formative assessment', 'health literacy', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'member', 'mobile application', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'pill', 'prototype', 'repository', 'satisfaction', 'statistics', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'web app']",NIA,"DIMAGI, INC.",R43,2018,224991,0.09997978377755533
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes. The study will result in improved ability to appreciate cognition in older adults electing surgery and optimize their perioperative experience.",PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing,9382352,R01AG055337,"['Abdomen', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Anesthetics', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Comprehension', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Records', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurons', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Perioperative', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Price', 'Psyche structure', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'cost', 'digital', 'executive function', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peer', 'performance tests', 'prospective', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2017,479151,0.06807730693189654
"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this application is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smart phones, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to perform health assessment and detection of health events (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to support sustainable improvement of brain health (Aim 3). Finally, we train machine learning algorithms from the clinical observations to automate assessment of health and intervention impact (Aim 4). The use of these technologies is expected to improve and extend the functional health and wellbeing of older adults, lead to more proactive and preventative health care, and reduce the caregiver burden of health monitoring and assistance. By understanding situational factors that impact prompt adherence, adherence situations can be increased. The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new machine learning techniques for activity learning and health assessment based on clinical ground truth. These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home technology to automatically identify health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smart home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions,9370133,R01NR016732,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation Nursing', 'Research', 'Self Management', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brain health', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'cost', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention effect', 'learning strategy', 'personalized intervention', 'physical conditioning', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'social', 'technology validation', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'usability']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,352983,0.07325099120903916
"Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults spend over 8 hours per day sitting, more than any other age group. High sedentary time has now been associated with adverse health impacts (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease related mortality) independent from physical activity. This suggests that research explicitly focusing on sedentary behavior is warranted. To further the field of sedentary behavior research among older adults with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, three gaps will be addressed: 1) improving measures of sedentary time using advanced technology-based methods (due to limitations of self-reports and traditional accelerometer data processing techniques); 2) understanding relationships between sedentary time and cardio-metabolic biomarkers and health conditions; and, 3) developing technology-based interventions to reduce sedentary time. The iSTAND (Investigating Sedentary Time in Aging: New Directions using technology) Project aims to address these gaps using data from 3 rich sources (Successful Aging Evaluation [SAGE] Study, the Women's Health Initiative [WHI] Long Life Study, and a participant pool from a large integrated health care system). In the first research aim, objective measurement techniques for sedentary time (e.g. accelerometers, SenseCam, machine learning algorithms) are explored (Aim 1a), and machine learning algorithms for accelerometer data are applied to the WHI sample to examine relationships between sedentary time and health risk factors among older women (Aim 1b). In Aim 2, focus groups will be conducted to inform development of a technology-based sedentary time reduction program targeting older adults with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease. In a pilot intervention, the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be tested in 40 older aduls with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease from a large integrated health care system. The research plans dovetail with training plans for Dr. Rosenberg to obtain necessary skills and knowledge in 2 key areas where she has deficits: 1) wireless technologies to measure sedentary time more accurately, and, 2) application of wireless technologies to sedentary time reduction interventions among older adults. The project will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors (bioinformatics, technology and measurement, geriatrics, statistics) and knowledge obtained through training experiences, coursework, and conferences. Support from this 4-year patient-oriented research career development award will position Dr. Rosenberg to lead an independent research program in using technology decrease sedentary time among older adults with chronic health conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sedentary behaviors (activities done in a seated or lying down position, such as watching television) are associated with many adverse health impacts. Older adults with chronic conditions engage in high levels of sedentary time, yet sedentary time is an understudied behavioral risk. This project will leverage technology advancements to measure sedentary time and examine relationships with health risk factors. It will also develop a technology-based program to reduce sedentary time and support healthy aging in the growing population of older adults with chronic health conditions.",Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND),9323499,K23HL119352,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Glucose', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hour', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Older Population', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Preparation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Wireless Technology', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolic risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'frailty', 'group intervention', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light intensity', 'moderate-to-vigorous physical activity', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'older women', 'patient oriented research', 'population based', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'retention rate', 'satisfaction', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'tool', 'tv watching']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,K23,2017,137691,0.1548085327222799
"Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place SUMMARY This proposal is for an NLM sponsored K01 Mentored Career Development Award. The research I propose involves the development of a smart mobile application combined with commercially available sensors, to capture actionable information about behavior pattern changes in both patients with dementia and their primary caregivers. Through continuously collected physiological sensor data, I will build data models that can learn the behavior patterns of both the patient with dementia and his/her caregiver. My research plan involves three stages. The first stage involves instrument validation and generating context-specific ground truth or the baseline for each participating couple. The second stage will involve longitudinal observational study using the system built in the first stage in an assisted living facility. The final stage will involve deploying our system for a longitudinal study in the homes of our participants. This study merges well with my short term goals to learn more about the challenges faced by older adults as they battle physical and cognitive decline. As a computer science researcher, my long term goal is to work on building technologies that allow older couples to live independently in their homes for a longer time, and to have more control over their quality of life. I have experience working in eldercare research as a part of my doctoral studies in University of Missouri's Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology. I plan to continue working in this field and develop my independent research program that facilitates aging in place through the use of low cost sensors and machine learning analytics. Currently as an Instructor and Research Assistant Professor at Wright State University's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I have strong mentors both in the technical and clinical areas that will allow me to grow in this highly interdisciplinary area. My career development plan includes coursework, regular meetings with mentors and collaborators, and practical clinical study experience that will facilitate my development of an independent research program that will enrich and improve the lives of older adults for years to come. NARRATIVE With the spread of smartphones and wearable sensors in the fitness industry, there is a great opportunity for personalized digital health, especially for chronic conditions like dementia. As an increasing cohort of older adults suffer from dementia, there arises a strong need to extract relevant patient symptoms collected using sensors to provide actionable information for timely intervention. The objective of this application is to map data collected from physiological sensors with the behavior patterns of persons with dementia, as well as the caregiver to understand the physiological changes associated with behavior changes to facilitate early intervention through timely alerts to clinicians.",Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place,9339726,K01LM012439,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Community Health', 'Couples', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Personnel', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instructor', 'instrument', 'learned behavior', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile application', 'multisensory', 'primary caregiver', 'professor', 'programs', 'rehabilitation technology', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'support tools', 'trait', 'usability', 'web app']",NLM,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,170236,0.08735207187197944
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9353310,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2017,157988,0.11217519482963846
"Improving patient and caregiver engagement through the application of data science methods to audio recorded clinic visits stored in personal health libraries PROJECT SUMMARY    Forty to eighty percent of clinic visit information is forgotten by patients immediately post visit, a significant  barrier to self-­management leading to poor health outcomes. Visit summaries can improve recall, yet patient  uptake is limited and clinicians report significant burden in creating summaries for laypeople. Patients are  beginning to audio record visits and clinics are now offering this service. When patients receive a clinic  recording, 71% listen and 68% share it with a caregiver, resulting in improved understanding and self-­ management. Yet, unstructured recordings are difficult to navigate. Personal health libraries (PHLs) may help

strategies of older adults with multimorbidity and caregivers;; Aim 2 Develop an Audio-­PHL using data science  methods to securely analyze clinic visit recordings and make this information accessible and understandable  for patients;; and Aim 3 Demonstrate the usability and use of an Audio-­PHL in older adults with multimorbidity  and caregivers. Applicants hypothesize: (1) The Audio-­PHL will surpass acceptable usability metrics in older  adults and caregivers and (2) natural language processing (NLP) methods developed for the Audio-­PHL will  accurately identify key visit information (e.g. medication) and connect it to credible patient resources. The  development of the Audio-­PHL follows a user centered design model. In Aim 1, the applicants will use  participatory design activities with 48 end-­users to inform Audio-­PHL design. In Aim 2, the Audio-­PHL will be  created in iterative cycles informed by findings from Aim 1. In Aim 3, extensive usability evaluation will be  conducted in human computer interaction (HCI) laboratory settings to ensure Audio-­PHL surpasses acceptable  usability metrics. Field testing of the Audio-­PHL will follow via a patient-­randomized pilot trial with older adults  with multimorbidity from primary care. Participants (N=70) will receive an Audio-­PHL (intervention) or PHL

benefits of clinic recordings through the novel application of data science methods, to improve health outcomes  for older adults with multimorbidity through greater knowledge and confidence in their ability to self-­manage.   PROJECT NARRATIVE    Between 40 – 80% of clinic visit information is forgotten immediately by patients, a significant impediment to  self-­management for older adults with multimorbidity that leads to poor health outcomes. The proposed

"A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults Abstract  People aged 65+ will represent 21% of the U.S. population and increase to about 80 million by 2040, and the oldest old (age 85+) will number ~ 14.1 million. Population aging presents both opportunities and challenges for our healthcare, the economy, and existing social support systems. Many older adults especially the oldest old, minorities and those of lower Socio-Economic status (SES) are particularly vulnerable to social isolation, poor diet, and decreased levels of physical activity each of which influence morbidity and mortality. Mobile-based, tablet-based, and in-home technologies provide an excellent opportunity for projecting behavior- change interventions and social support into the everyday life of older adults at great economies of scale. The objectives of this study are to examine the usability and efficacy, for diverse older adults, of a new tablet-based dynamic system: the Fittle Senior System (FSS) that will provide: (1) personalized behavior-change programs for improved diet and increased physical activity and (2) online social interaction and support from small teams pursuing similar goals. The system builds on two technology-based systems developed by the investigative team: (1) the computer-based PRISM system, designed for older populations to support social connectivity and well-being, and (2) the Fittle+ mobile platform designed to support positive health behavior change through integrated online social support and personalized coaching based on artificial intelligence (AI). The study will be conducted in two phases. During Phase 1 we will develop and pilot test the FSS with representative samples of older adults. Phase 2 will involve a two group randomized trial where participants will be randomized to the Fittle Senior System (FSS, an adaptive coaching and social support system using mobile technology) or to a paper-based psycho-educational (BPE) control condition following a baseline assessment. The duration of the intervention phase will involve an active 12-week intervention phase followed by a 12-week maintenance phase. We will recruit and randomize 180 community dwelling adults aged 65+ years, who live alone and are at risk for social isolation (90 per condition - 30 White Caucasians, 30 Black/African Americans and 30 Hispanic Americans). We will recruit males and females commensurate to the gender proportions represented in this age group and work to ensure that we have sufficient representation from the “oldest old” cohort. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3mths post active intervention and 3mths post maintenance (6mths following active intervention) on clinically significant measures of health and health behaviors and indices of social support. We will also gather information on potential moderating (e.g., ethnicity, age) and mediating variables (e.g., health self-efficacy), which will be examined using multilevel modeling techniques guided by current theories of behavior change and technology acceptance and use among older adults. Project Narrative This proposed project is addressing a critical public concern. The population is aging and chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are common among older adults especially ethnic minorities. This study will develop and evaluate a mobile technology-based intervention designed to support positive health behavior change among diverse older adults through integrated online social support, personalized coaching and goal setting.",A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults,9346004,R01AG053163,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caucasians', 'Chronic', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Industry', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Jordan', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Older Population', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Self Efficacy', 'Social Interaction', 'Social isolation', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Support System', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'active method', 'age group', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinically significant', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'dynamic system', 'education research', 'efficacy trial', 'ethnic minority population', 'family structure', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'low socioeconomic status', 'male', 'medical schools', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'nutrition', 'programs', 'psychoeducational', 'psychoeducational intervention', 'randomized trial', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,579139,0.12250430798267131
"NRI: Collaborative Research: Quadrupedal Human-Assistive Robotic Platform (Q-HARP) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed project aims at developing a novel quadrupedal human-assistive robotic platform (Q-HARP}, with the objective of helping the large number of elderly individuals live a healthy, physically active life style. The Q-HARP primarily functions as a smart power-assist walker: a user, situated in the center of the legged robot, can enjoy the desired amount of power assist in walking according to his/her intent. As such, a Q-HARP user is able to perform an appropriate amount of physical activity, while enjoying the enhanced level of mobility during his/her daily lif. Furthermore, with the Q-HARP's legged motion, the human-robot system can easily overcome most obstacles in the daily life. With this capability, the Q-HARP has a potential of becoming a basic building block for Aging-in-Place, enabling elderly individuals to stay in their home longer without conducting costly modification to their existing home structures. To develop this innovative robot, the investigators will conduct research in various aspects of the project. The specific aims of the project are: AIM 1) Understand user needs and promote user involvement in the research process; AIM 2) Create a systematic design framework for the human-assistive quadrupedal robot, and build robot prototypes for experimental testing; AIM 3) Develop a 3D computer vision-based approach for motion and environment detection; AIM 4) Study the human assistive strategies in assistive walking and emergency response; AIM 5) Develop an intelligent robot control system for interactive assistance in locomotion; AIM 6) Conduct experiments to test the robot performance in human assistance tasks. The project's potential bene*fits to society are substantial. By 2030, there will be 71 million older adults living in the S, accounting for 20°/o of the entire population. For the health and well ness of older adults, a key contributing factor is to be physically active. However, a large number of older adults have significant difficulty in staying physically active due to mobility impairment. By providing desire physical assistance in the coordinated locomotion, the Q-HARP is anticipated to restore an elderly person's mobility, keep him/her physically active, and enjoy a more healthy life with reduced reliance on the assistance of caregivers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The human-assistive robotic platform in this proposal has a potential of promoting and improving the health and well ness of the large elderly population in the US, and thus is in direct support of NINR's mission. Specifically, it fits well into the theme of ""Wellness: Promoting Health and Preventing Illness"" by helping elderly individuals to stay physically active and prevent the illnesses associated with the sedentary lifestyle.",NRI: Collaborative Research: Quadrupedal Human-Assistive Robotic Platform (Q-HARP),9313141,R01NR016151,"['Accounting', 'Aging', 'Caregivers', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Emergency response', 'Environment', 'Equine mule', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Locomotion', 'Mental Depression', 'Mission', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Side', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Walkers', 'Walking', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'robot control', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R01,2017,125000,0.0823104326818905
"Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of elderly who cannot maintain functional independence in their own homes is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, gaps in our knowledge base concerning how to scale and validate activity recognition and health assessment technologies currently limit clinical translation of smart environments for real-time health monitoring and intervention. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this renewal application is to design, evaluate and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide automated health assessment and support real-time interventions. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. We hypothesize that many older adults who require support completing everyday activities can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Building on our pioneering prior work and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) expand and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities and provide automated functional assessment to encompass a greater number of behaviors and more diverse older adult population; (2) develop and validate software algorithms that provide automated health assessment by partnering actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment with in-home smart home data; (3) develop technologies to provide data-driven context-aware automated prompts; and (4) investigate methods for visualizing and integrating clinically-relevant smart home health data into personal and electronic health records. The proposed work is innovative because it partners real-time methodologies and defines methods of detecting and coping with aging and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. This work is significant because it provides the basis for technologies that will keep older adults with functional impairment in their homes and monitor frail older individuals from afar. The outcome of this work will result in automated health assessments that make use of smart technology, recommendations for improving the ecological validity of office-based clinical assessments, automated real-time intervention methods that can help support preventative health care measures, and clinically-relevant, user-friendly interfaces for integration of smart home data into health records. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smar home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to gather validated activity and health related information that can be used by the medical community to improve the efficacy of traditional assessment and support ecological momentary intervention techniques. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance,9303391,R01EB009675,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Phonation', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Progress Reports', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Software Design', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'computer science', 'coping', 'cost effective', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social', 'technology development', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,334829,0.12163017822485271
"A New Paradigm for Hypertension in the Elderly- Beyond Age DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 60% of adults age � 65 years have high blood pressure (BP), but optimal management of high BP in the elderly remains controversial. Contrary to evidence in middle age that lowering BP is clearly beneficial, data in older adults are inconsistent and high BP may not be a risk factor in all elders. We recently reported that, among participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey age e65 years, high BP was a risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) death only among persons in better health status (defined as fast walking of a 20-ft walk test). In contrast, high BP was not a risk factor among slow walkers. Additionally, the benefit of lowering BP in all elders remains an issue of debate; a recent meta-analysis in persons age 80 years and older reported no benefit of BP treatment on mortality, and significant heterogeneity across trials. Finally, there is growin concern for potential harms associated with treatment to lower BP. Excessive lowering of BP, particularly diastolic, has been associated with increased risk for death and cardiovascular events in some studies. In the proposed research, we propose a novel paradigm where the associations of BP with adverse outcomes in older persons are considered in the setting of the complex aging process. Our long-term goal is to reliably identify elderly persons in whom BP treatment is beneficial and those in whom treatment is ineffective or even harmful, by defining subpopulations of similar health status. Specifically, aim 1 proposes to elucidate factors from four domains (functional, cognitive/mental, self-rated health, and physiologic) that can identify elderly persons in whom high systolic BP is strongly associated with higher risk for death and CV events, and those in whom it is not, using data from three NIH-funded cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) and Sacramento Area Latino Study of Aging (SALSA). In aim 2, we will evaluate the role of diastolic BP across level of health status. Finally, based on findings from these observational cohorts, in aim 3 we will evaluate whether these factors can identify elderly persons in whom treatment to lower BP is of maximum benefit in two randomized controlled trials: the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly (SHEP) and the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3). Since participants in trials are healthier than the U.S. population, we will also evaluate the effect of treatment in the observational studies, using state-of-the-art causal inference methods, which can correct for the bias of standard analytic approaches. Completion of these aims will substantially advance our understanding of the importance of high BP in older adults; will improve our ability to identify elderly persons who will benefit from BP treatment; will allow a systematic understanding of groups in whom evidence for BP treatment is lacking; and will guide design of future trials of hypertension in elderly adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Treatment of high blood pressure in elderly persons remains controversial.

"Working Memory Training in Older Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that cognitive interventions targeting working memory are beneficial in that they show generalizing effects that go beyond what has been specifically trained, i.e. transfer effects. Although it seems more difficult to observe such transfer effects in older adults as compared to young adults or children, we and others have found that some interventions do show promise in older populations. Despite the promising results, more research is needed to make our interventions more effective and more robust, and to uncover the underlying mechanisms of training in an aging population. For our proposed studies, we envision two lines of research with different goals: First, we aim to address questions of pragmatics. Our goal here is to make our intervention more accessible and inviting for participants, thus increasing their motivation to participate effectively in training regimens. In addition, we will investigate the intervention's optimal scheduling (i.e., spacing of practice), and explore whether the improvements extend to measures of everyday functioning, and finally, investigate longitudinal effects and their trajectories over the course of one year after training completion. These are our applied goals. Second, we propose to address the most important questions of any intervention research: The investigation of the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms of improvement. Furthermore, we will shed light on individual differences as moderating factors for training success. These are our mechanistic goals. Given the sparse availability of effective cognitive interventions, and the limited knowledge about their generalizing effects to applied measures of daily living, the proposed work will have important implications in that it will shed more light on the mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in old age, and serve as groundwork for future large-scale randomized clinical trials and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The vast majority of our nation's aging population will experience some decline in cognitive function with age. Therefore, the development of effective preventative interventions to mitigate age-related cognitive decline is of critical importance in that those interventions could not only impact older adults' cognitive and daily life functioning, but ultimately, contribute to their well-being and quality of life. The proposed work will have important implications in that it will get at the underlying mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in ld age, and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted cognitive interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia.",Working Memory Training in Older Adults,9284375,R01AG049006,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Financial compensation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Motivation', 'Older Population', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Populations at Risk', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Schedule', 'Self Efficacy', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specificity', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'active control', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'computerized', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow up assessment', 'improved', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success', 'therapy design', 'usability', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2017,648284,0.060416910720712765
"Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality Abstract Older adults struggle to engage in health enhancing physical activity (PA) and spend up to 11 hours a day sitting. Older women, in particular, are at increased risk of chronic disease and disability, and use a high proportion of healthcare resources. Improving both these behaviors has promise for improving several salient aging outcomes, but evidence to inform guidelines on how best to interrupt long periods of sedentary behavior (SB) are lacking. Few laboratory-based trials have included adults over 70 years old, have focused on PA to interrupt SB, and have not tested standing breaks that might be acceptable to older adults. A recent review showed that in the real world, traditional PA interventions do not meaningfully impact SB. In contrast, interventions that focus on standing can reduce SB, up to 2 hours per day. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between self-reported SB and increased risks of death and metabolic outcomes, but very few prospective studies have employed objective measures of SB. Although accelerometer measures can indicate the intensity of movement or lack of it, traditional cutpoints do not accurately classify behaviors such as sitting, standing or walking. While pilot intervention studies, using thigh worn inclinometers, have demonstrated that SB can be greatly reduced, there are no RCTs in older adults with health outcomes. There is much room for improvement in our understanding of SB and healthy aging. The National Institute on Aging conducted a summer workshop series to address this issue in 2013. We have therefore designed a Program project – Sedentary Time and Aging Research (STAR) – to provide more rigorous and comprehensive evidence on how to interrupt sitting time and the consequences for healthy aging. In particular, we are proposing a paradigm shift away from energy expenditure as the primary mechanism for health outcomes to investigating behaviors such as brief sit-to-stand transitions that expend little energy but engage muscles, improve postural blood flow, and may impact physical functioning in older adults. Further, we will study a broader range of outcomes than investigated to date, including targeted novel mechanisms important for healthy aging. The STAR program will include 3 Projects and 2 Cores for study of postmenopausal women at risk for chronic disease. STAR includes 2 randomized trials, in the laboratory (N=86) and in the real world (N=592), with focus on optimizing new computational techniques to apply to existing prospective accelerometer data (n>6000). All projects will investigate the consequences of extended sitting, standing, brief sit-to-stand transitions and PA breaks on mechanisms of healthy aging including glucose regulation, endothelial functioning, and mitochondrial functioning. We will also investigate physical functioning, blood pressure and in Project 3, 5-7 year mortality risk. All Projects will compare effects across age groups. STAR will provide a comprehensive evidence base that can inform public health guidelines on SB and aging. We will coordinate our efforts with a new American Heart Association Center on SB and Latinas.  Narrative Sitting time may be particularly bad for the health of older women. This program grant will provide new and improved evidence to help the public understand how to interrupt sitting in ways that support healthy aging.  ","Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality",9278020,P01AG052352,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Computational Technique', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Latina', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Mitochondria', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Postmenopause', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'age effect', 'age group', 'attentional control', 'base', 'behavior observation', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'disability', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older women', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'response biomarker', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'young adult']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",P01,2017,1903305,0.06235700772360702
"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,9205503,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'cohesion', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'speech recognition', 'support network', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2017,2137301,0.08266191011553725
"Chronic Conditions and Mutuality of Care in Late Life Marriage:A Multi-method App DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% experience functional disability. Thus, married older adults are not only likely to cope with chronic conditios and disability of their own but also their spouse's. Understanding how support dynamics in marriage influence each partner's health will provide great insight into helping couples stay healthier and functionally independent into late life. The aim of the proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (MRSDA) is to train the candidate in epidemiology of aging and advanced dyadic data analysis techniques to build on her expertise in experimental research and to understand how mutual care in late-life marriage influence health, particularly cardiovascular health and depression, and longevity. The proposed research focuses on older couples in which both partners suffer from chronic conditions and disability, and drawing from communal relationships theory, mutual care is defined as both partners receiving high levels of balanced instrumental and emotional support from one another. Through this MRSDA, the candidate will (1) learn from expert mentors and consultants about the epidemiology of aging and advanced statistical techniques to analyze dyadic, longitudinal data, (2) conduct secondary analysis on a large epidemiologic dyadic data set to examine how mutual care in older adult marriages influences long-term health and longevity and an experiment to examine a proposed mechanism, cardiovascular stress recovery, (3) complete coursework in epidemiology of aging, advanced epidemiologic statistics, and research ethics, and (4) attend workshops on dyadic data analysis. Yale University is a phenomenal environment to pursue this training as it has extensive resources in epidemiology of aging, statistics for analyzing epidemiologic data, experimental relationships research, and cardiovascular psychophysiology. The candidate has a state-of-the- art observational and psychophysiology lab that she will utilize for this project. Th Yale School of Public Health and the Claude D. Pepper Older American's Independence Center at Yale have excellent junior faculty mentoring programs. The candidate's primary mentor, Dr. Becca Levy at Yale School of Public Health has extensive expertise in bridging experimental and epidemiological methods to study psychosocial factors and health in older adults, including dyads. Dr. Richard Schulz will serve as a co-mentor, as he is the primary investigator for the Cardiovascular Health Effects Study which will be used for Study 1 of the proposed research and is an expert in conducting large, longitudinal studies. Dr. Trace Kershaw, an expert in dyadic data analysis at Yale School of Public Health, will also be a co-mentor. The proposed training will occur in the context of (1) a longitudinal study of married couples in which both members of the couple have chronic conditions and disability (Study 1; The Caregiver Health Effects Study; n=819 couples; an ancillary study to the Cardiovascular Health Study) examining the influence of mutual support on health trajectories (e.g. clinical and subclinical indicators of cardiovascular disease, clinical depression, and self-reported health) and longevity, and (2) an experimental study (Study 2; n=100 couples) examining cardiovascular stress recovery, a proposed mechanism for the link between mutual care and cardiovascular health proposed in Study 1. In the experimental study each partner will discuss a health-related stressor, and mutual support will be manipulated and compared to a control and one-sided support conditions to examine the effects on cardiovascular stress recovery. Consistent with the priorities outlined by the National Institute on Aging, the proposed MRSDA has the potential to address mechanisms for links between interpersonal relationships and health in the context of aging (RFA: PA-11-128). Further, the combination of training and research will serve as a spring board for the candidate's independent research career to elucidate how interpersonal relationships influence health among older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% are functionally disabled.

"Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults exhibit poor recovery and are at high risk for rehospitalization after acute heart failure. Current rehabilitation and clinical management strategies have shown only modest benefits because the mechanisms underlying poor outcomes remain under recognized and therefore unmitigated. The proposed study will address this critical knowledge gap by examining the role of systemic mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity as a fundamental factor underlying poor physical function in hospitalized acute decompensated heart failure, the success of rehabilitation, and the prognosis of patients following hospitalization. This will be accomplished in a highly translational and cost-effective manner as an ancillary study to REHAB-HF (R01AG045551; PI: Kitzman), a multi-center clinical trial funded by the NIA that tests the hypothesis that impaired physical function underlies adverse outcomes in older hospitalized ADHF patients and employs a novel rehabilitation program that targets multiple domains of physical function for 12 weeks beginning during hospitalization. The results of REHAB-HF can impact clinical practice; however, its outcomes do not directly address potential mechanisms of action. Mitochondrial function is likely candidate for mediating physiological decline in REHAB-HF participants, because these organelles are sensitive to a myriad of intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to aging, physical function, heart failure, and hospitalization.  Mitochondrial dysfunction across multiple tissues has been implicated in physiological decline associated with heart failure and is thought to be mediated by circulating factors that affect systemic bioenergetic capacity. Therefore, we propose that respirometric profiling of circulating cells can be used to report on systemic bioenergetic decline in heart failure patients and will be associated with physical function and long term outcomes - including rehospitalization rate. We will determine whether the REHAB-HF rehabilitation program increases bioenergetic capacity, compared to control, thereby improving functional outcomes. Bioenergetic profiling of multiple blood cell populations will enable us to identify the specific cell types and bioenergetic parameters, or patterns comprised of multiple variables, that are most closely associated with REHAB-HF outcomes such as physical function and quality of life. We will also determine the ability of blood cells to report on systemic bioenergetic decline y examining relationships with mitochondrial function measured in skeletal muscle. Successful strategies for mitigating poor physical function and improving long-term outcomes rely on the identification of mechanisms that contribute to the vulnerability of patients after discharge. Bioenergetic profiling may enable the identification of patients in need of more intensive management and targeted rehabilitation. The advancement of blood-based bioenergetic profiling will enhance the use of this promising test in future trials, and potentially, in the cliical care of older patients with the wide range of chronic medical conditions associated with physical disability and poor clinical outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will examine the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the physical function of older adults hospitalized for acute heart failure, and th long term rehabilitation outcomes of these patients. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the success of recovery will lead to improved treatment strategies that can be personalized in order to maximize benefits for individual patients. The results of this study can improve the management of older adults hospitalized with acute heart failure and will be generalizable to the broader issues of age-related bioenergetic decline and post-hospitalization syndrome.",Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure,9267094,R21AG051077,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Ancillary Study', 'Bioenergetics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise stress test', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Heart failure', 'Hormones', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardium', 'Organelles', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Respiration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'exercise intolerance', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'long-term rehabilitation', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation management', 'respiratory', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2017,229328,0.04839409364433281
"High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression Project Summary/Abstract: Depression (target disease of this proposal) affects 34 million Americans including 2 million seniors per year. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (target population of this proposal). The vascular depression hypothesis (proposed in 1998) remains the most salient theory explaining the onset and perpetuation of depression in older adults. This model is based on the observation that in older adults, white matter hyperintensities (a hallmark of small vessel disease, SVD) are associated with depression onset and perpetuation. Progress in understanding the relationship of small vessel disease with late-life depression has been stymied in part by lack of specificity of white matter hyperintensities which can represent components of edema, gliosis, ischemia, and inflammation. Traditional MR imaging is unable to distinguish between these components, and thus the specific mechanisms that contribute to depression remain unclear.  The emergence of ultrahigh field MR imaging allows for greater specificity of the WMH lesions, and other components of small vessel disease. Bringing 7 tesla (T) imaging into mainstream clinical use will be accomplished through 1) having exclusive (over 1.5/3T) application(s) and 2) achieving robust, safe, consistent, and homogenous high-quality images. Through a consortium consisting of experts at University of Pittsburgh combined with collaboration at FDA, University of Minnesota, and Quality Electrodynamics Inc., our goal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. We will achieve this goal through the development of robust radiofrequency methodology, as well as pulse sequences that produce 7T images with the aforementioned necessary attributes. This will be paired with complementary 3T MRI at baseline. We will use our recently developed (as well as a proposed) custom designed 7T radiofrequency coil system and pulse sequences that are already being used in disease/patient studies. Based on our preliminary results, the proposed RF solution will provide unprecedented homogeneity and consistency among different subjects/patients, and therefore excellent signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio for detection of components of small vessel disease. The study will examine two cohorts 1) a group of 30 older adults recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) for developing an MRI to histopathology statistical model of SVD and 2) 60 older adults with late-life depression who will undergo scanning at baseline and after 2 years. The longitudinal 7T MRI and SVD model will be used to help characterize the small vessel changes associated with depression in older adults.  In summary, this study develops an emerging and timely technology (high-performance ultrahigh field MRI) to study a critical pathophysiological process (cerebral small vessel disease) in a clinically relevant population (Late-Life Depression). This project will further advance all of these three domains. Project Narrative: The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. This will be accomplished through the development of radiofrequency hardware, methodology, pulse sequences and protocols using 7 Tesla (T) human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in conjunction with complimentary 3T MRI. The clinical relevance of the proposed tools will be achieved through comprehensive characterization of 1) components of cerebral small vessel disease in individuals with late-life depression and 2) progression of small vessel disease markers over 2 years. One of our overarching goals is to achieve a highly useful 7T clinical utility, which requires high quality, robust, and consistent acquisitions. This could be a potentially exclusive (over other human MRI field strengths) application for 7T imaging.",High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression,9352370,R01MH111265,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Consultations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Edema', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Gliosis', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Heating', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'Work', 'absorption', 'aging brain', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disturbance in affect', 'follow-up', 'geriatric depression', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'radiofrequency', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'vascular depression']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,600239,0.08460583172114583
"Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is a stigmatized, underreported, under-diagnosed, under-treated yet common condition that negatively impacts quality of life of many older adults. UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI. The long-term goal is to design innovative clinical trials to mitigate and prevent UUI and UTI in older men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine accompanied by a strong and urgent desire to urinate and is associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTI), the second most frequent infection among older adults. UUI is extremely common among older men and women and current treatments are not successful in most patients. The Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use an existing racially/ethnically diverse and clinically well-characterized cohort to investigate the association of current UUI status and future UTI with risk factors, both established (e.g., obesity and diabetes) and novel (i.e., vitamin D and the urinary microbiome) and create prediction models that identify individuals at high risk for UUI and UTI.

"Integrated Web-Based Customer Engagement, Physical Exercise, and Coaching Platform for Older Adults ABSTRACT The fast-growing older population coupled with the worsening shortage of caregivers and nurses will soon present our nation with severe societal and economic challenges. Older adults often struggle to maintain quality of life and independence in the presence of chronic diseases and isolation. Physical exercise and socialization have been shown to reduce chronic disease, depression, falls and to improve quality of life in older adults. Motivation and feedback are essential to continued engagement in a wellness program, but doing so through the traditional manner of in-person coaching can be prohibitively expensive. Vigorous Mind (VM) has been providing a web-based platform to promote sustained engagement in older adults primarily in senior living facilities. The platform provides dynamic and tailored content including reminiscence activities, favorite music and video, adaptive computer games and communication. With the help of the Consortium on Technology for Proactive Care, we will enhance the current VM system with an additional interactive physical exercise module and a health coach with automated tailored messaging and incentives for continued engagement and adherence. This will optimize the VM system for home-based deployment, thus expanding the reach and impact of VM to potentially delay or even prevent institutionalization among older adults living independently. There is a compelling need for a tool that can increase older adults’ engagement in physical activity and socialization to reduce chronic disease, depression and falls and improve quality of life in this fast-growing population. The proposed integrated web-based platform represents the first step in the development of environments that combine human and machine intelligence in order to care for older adults and to enhance their quality of life.","Integrated Web-Based Customer Engagement, Physical Exercise, and Coaching Platform for Older Adults",9408822,R43AG057337,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Independent Living', 'Institutionalization', 'Intervention', 'Mental Depression', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Music', 'Nurses', 'Older Population', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Exercise', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Retirement', 'Rewards', 'Socialization', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Wellness Program', 'Work', 'base', 'computer game', 'design', 'falls', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'tailored messaging', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,"VIGOROUS MIND, INC.",R43,2017,218333,0.14456481830147694
"Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding and Monitoring System (MEDSReM) Abstract for Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding and Monitoring System (MEDSReM) Hypertension is prevalent among older adults. Hypertension increases risk for stroke and myocardial infarction, and can result in end organ damage to the kidneys, retina and brain. Medication adherence is critically important to prevent the deleterious effects of hypertension; yet, adherence is often calculated at only 50%. We developed and tested the Multifaceted Prospective Memory Intervention (MPMI), a behavioral intervention, using theories of prospective memory and aging to improve adherence to antihypertensive medications. The MPMI was tested among older adults (≥ 65 years of age) and improved adherence by 35%. The MPMI was efficacious over the short term, but after an additional 5 months without the ongoing presence of the interventionists, adherence declined. The purpose of the current study is to create an evidence-based smartphone application and companion website in order to provide continuous use of the efficacious strategies to sustain adherence. We are at an exciting time since among persons with hypertension the potential benefits of improved health can be achieved through improved adherence. The recent SPRINT study (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) supports improved outcomes (lower fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause) by targeting a lower systolic blood pressure of 120 mm Hg compared to using the previously recommended guideline of 140 mm Hg.2 These outcomes will not be achieved unless we can help people take their medications as prescribed and as intended. Specifically using iterative usability, cognitive walk-through and heuristic evaluation, we will build, test and modify a mobile application (App) and companion website, the Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding and Monitoring System (MEDSReM). Mobile devices are ubiquitous and can be leveraged to capture the prospective memory strategies and improve adherence. The development of the MEDSReM will be based on the strategies from the MPMI, human factors in aging, preferences, needs and requirements of older adults taking medications using technology and iterative testing to assure usability for older adults. The strategies will be translated to technology and add decision support. Decision support will provide the patient with assistance in taking medications if they have missed a dose. A decision tree will be created with knowledge of pharmacotherapeutic and pharmacokinetics based on the patient's medication time to peak, duration and half-life properties to determine a safe interval for taking missed doses. The final MEDSReM will include a website that can easily be accessed with links in the App for educational support and ongoing coaching. Taking a human factors approach to inform the preferences, needs and requirements for technological support to take medications as intended, and iterative testing for usability of the App and website among older adults, will result in a superior product for the mobile App and website and improve health outcomes. This final product will be field tested and consequent improvement in adherence assessed. Public Health Significance High blood pressure is common among older adults and can lead to poor health including the increased likelihood of stroke and heart disease. Adhering to medications that lower blood pressure is difficult, particularly among older adults who have been shown to experience age-associated declines in cognitive processes that could support medication taking. A previously tested intervention was successful in improving adherence. The aim of this study is to translate the intervention into mobile technology with the goal of sustaining good adherence.","Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding and Monitoring System (MEDSReM)",9314865,R21NR016285,"['Adherence', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Companions', 'Consult', 'Cues', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Financial cost', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Half-Life', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Memory Loss', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Self Management', 'Self-Administered', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'executive function', 'experience', 'field study', 'handheld mobile device', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'memory process', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'post intervention', 'preference', 'prevent', 'prospective memory', 'prototype', 'software development', 'successful intervention', 'theories', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2017,268625,0.09869502461271949
"Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults spend over 8 hours per day sitting, more than any other age group. High sedentary time has now been associated with adverse health impacts (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease related mortality) independent from physical activity. This suggests that research explicitly focusing on sedentary behavior is warranted. To further the field of sedentary behavior research among older adults with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, three gaps will be addressed: 1) improving measures of sedentary time using advanced technology-based methods (due to limitations of self-reports and traditional accelerometer data processing techniques); 2) understanding relationships between sedentary time and cardio-metabolic biomarkers and health conditions; and, 3) developing technology-based interventions to reduce sedentary time. The iSTAND (Investigating Sedentary Time in Aging: New Directions using technology) Project aims to address these gaps using data from 3 rich sources (Successful Aging Evaluation [SAGE] Study, the Women's Health Initiative [WHI] Long Life Study, and a participant pool from a large integrated health care system). In the first research aim, objective measurement techniques for sedentary time (e.g. accelerometers, SenseCam, machine learning algorithms) are explored (Aim 1a), and machine learning algorithms for accelerometer data are applied to the WHI sample to examine relationships between sedentary time and health risk factors among older women (Aim 1b). In Aim 2, focus groups will be conducted to inform development of a technology-based sedentary time reduction program targeting older adults with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease. In a pilot intervention, the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be tested in 40 older aduls with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease from a large integrated health care system. The research plans dovetail with training plans for Dr. Rosenberg to obtain necessary skills and knowledge in 2 key areas where she has deficits: 1) wireless technologies to measure sedentary time more accurately, and, 2) application of wireless technologies to sedentary time reduction interventions among older adults. The project will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors (bioinformatics, technology and measurement, geriatrics, statistics) and knowledge obtained through training experiences, coursework, and conferences. Support from this 4-year patient-oriented research career development award will position Dr. Rosenberg to lead an independent research program in using technology decrease sedentary time among older adults with chronic health conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sedentary behaviors (activities done in a seated or lying down position, such as watching television) are associated with many adverse health impacts. Older adults with chronic conditions engage in high levels of sedentary time, yet sedentary time is an understudied behavioral risk. This project will leverage technology advancements to measure sedentary time and examine relationships with health risk factors. It will also develop a technology-based program to reduce sedentary time and support healthy aging in the growing population of older adults with chronic health conditions.",Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND),9115229,K23HL119352,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Glucose', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hour', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Preparation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Wireless Technology', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolic risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'frailty', 'group intervention', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light intensity', 'moderate-to-vigorous physical activity', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'older women', 'patient oriented research', 'population based', 'programs', 'retention rate', 'satisfaction', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'tool', 'tv watching']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,K23,2016,142671,0.1548085327222799
"Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] needed for older adults to maintain optimal physical function is unknown. Institute of Medicine and Endocrine Society have publicly debated on 20 ng/mL or 30 ng/mL, respectively, as targets for skeletal health, but both groups agree that stronger evidence is needed to identify target concentrations for extra-skeletal outcomes, e.g., falls and physical function. The problem is significant: >25% of older adults have poor physical function, 50% have 25(OH)D concentrations between 20 and 30 ng/mL. Identifying 25(OH)D targets for older adults will have immediate impact by informing design and analysis of vitamin D supplementation trials. Namely, targets serve as inclusion/exclusion criteria or baseline subgroups and as secondary outcomes. Our solution is to empirically identify and validate sex-specific (possibly stratified by other factors; e.g., race, genetic variants) 25(OH)D targets in older adults (= 65 years) related to lowe risk of falls and better physical function using existing NIH-funded datasets. A critical challenge is that 25(OH)D cannot be randomized; therefore observational data are a crucial part of the solution. Conventional statistical methods are ill-equipped for this problem; thus, we will develop novel statistical methods by adapting and refining structural modeling and machine-learning methods, and apply them to our aims. We will carry out the aims using 4 prospective cohort studies comprising >12,500 older adults: Health, Aging, and Body Composition, Invecchiare in Chianti, Osteoporotic Fractures in Men, and Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. We will: 1) identify and validate 25(OH)D targets for falls reduction, mobility, activities of daily living, and instrumental activities of daily living (functional outcomes); and gait speed, muscle strength, and frailty (proximal conditions) (aim 1); 2) characterize the joint impact of 25(OH)D and serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations on functional outcomes/proximal conditions (aim 2); and 3) quantify mediation of 25(OH)D on functional outcomes/proximal conditions by endocrine and metabolic factors (PTH, serum alkaline phosphatase, aklotho, fibroblast growth factor 23) (aim 3). We will write code in SAS and R statistical languages and disseminate it to the scientific community for use in additional research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aging of the population is expected to lead to an increased burden of poor physical function and loss of independence. Low concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] are common in older adults and may be one reason for deficits in physical function. Since 25(OH)D can easily be increased by sunlight exposure, diet, and supplements; identifying and validating a target 25(OH)D for functional outcomes in older adults can have a significant impact on public health.",Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults,9147536,R01AG048069,"['25-hydroxyvitamin D', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Body mass index', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Elderly', 'Endocrine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gait speed', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Living', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intake', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'PTH gene', 'Phosphorus', 'Physical Function', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Sun Exposure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D supplementation', 'Woman', 'Writing', 'aging population', 'bone', 'bone health', 'calcium intake', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic variant', 'inclusion criteria', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'outcome forecast', 'prospective', 'sarcopenia', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'skeletal', 'ultraviolet']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2016,321959,0.12305412919844659
"Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place SUMMARY This proposal is for an NLM sponsored K01 Mentored Career Development Award. The research I propose involves the development of a smart mobile application combined with commercially available sensors, to capture actionable information about behavior pattern changes in both patients with dementia and their primary caregivers. Through continuously collected physiological sensor data, I will build data models that can learn the behavior patterns of both the patient with dementia and his/her caregiver. My research plan involves three stages. The first stage involves instrument validation and generating context-specific ground truth or the baseline for each participating couple. The second stage will involve longitudinal observational study using the system built in the first stage in an assisted living facility. The final stage will involve deploying our system for a longitudinal study in the homes of our participants. This study merges well with my short term goals to learn more about the challenges faced by older adults as they battle physical and cognitive decline. As a computer science researcher, my long term goal is to work on building technologies that allow older couples to live independently in their homes for a longer time, and to have more control over their quality of life. I have experience working in eldercare research as a part of my doctoral studies in University of Missouri's Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology. I plan to continue working in this field and develop my independent research program that facilitates aging in place through the use of low cost sensors and machine learning analytics. Currently as an Instructor and Research Assistant Professor at Wright State University's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I have strong mentors both in the technical and clinical areas that will allow me to grow in this highly interdisciplinary area. My career development plan includes coursework, regular meetings with mentors and collaborators, and practical clinical study experience that will facilitate my development of an independent research program that will enrich and improve the lives of older adults for years to come. NARRATIVE With the spread of smartphones and wearable sensors in the fitness industry, there is a great opportunity for personalized digital health, especially for chronic conditions like dementia. As an increasing cohort of older adults suffer from dementia, there arises a strong need to extract relevant patient symptoms collected using sensors to provide actionable information for timely intervention. The objective of this application is to map data collected from physiological sensors with the behavior patterns of persons with dementia, as well as the caregiver to understand the physiological changes associated with behavior changes to facilitate early intervention through timely alerts to clinicians.",Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place,9222881,K01LM012439,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Community Health', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Dementia caregivers', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Observational Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'fitness', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'instructor', 'instrument', 'learned behavior', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'mobile application', 'multisensory', 'primary caregiver', 'professor', 'programs', 'rehabilitation technology', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'support tools', 'trait', 'usability', 'web app']",NLM,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,168375,0.08735207187197944
"Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Richard D. Boyce, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh. He has training in informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and comparative effectiveness research as well as a strong commitment to improving medication safety for older adults. His prior work has focused on artificial intelligence methods for predicting drug-drug interactions and the comparative safety of antidepressants for treating de-pressed nursing home residents. The current proposal is for a three year Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) from the National Institute on Aging for training and support that will address gaps in his knowledge of aging research and the nursing home setting. In collaboration with his mentoring team (Drs. Charles Reynolds, Jordan Karp, and Steven Handler) he has developed a training and research plan that will both fill in these knowledge gaps and prepare him for an independent research career. The overarching goal of his K01 is to become an expert on how to effectively translate research results from pharmacoepidemiology and comparative effectiveness research to informatics interventions that improve medication safety for older adults, especially nursing home residents. To accomplish this goal, he proposes eight career development activities and two research aims that will help him 1) obtain rigorous training in the science and practice of creating clinical decision support interventions that are effective in the nursing home setting; 2) obtain a thorough understanding of how falls and fall risk factors are detected, monitored, reported, and assessed in the nursing home setting; and 3) learn the perceptions of multiple nursing home clinician stakeholders on what research is needed to help reduce medication-related adverse events. The two research aims will enable him to integrate and apply the knowledge that he will gain through the proposed training activities by exploring the feasibility and potential clinical usefulness of actively monitoring patients exposed to psycho- tropic PDDIs. The approach would use electronic data available in most United States (US) NHs to provide highly specific and actionable alerts to physicians and/or nurses when a resident who is exposed to a PDDI involving a psychotropic drug transitions to a state of unacceptably high risk for experiencing a fall. Dr. Boyce's hypothesis is that this approach will extend the ability of NH clinicians to perform the recommended ""diligent monitoring"" of PDDIs, while avoiding alert fatigue. He anticipates that the approach would be generalizable to other prevalent NH ADEs (e.g., delirium) and other drug classes (e.g., mood stabilizers). This proposal is relevant to public health because it will explore an innovative approach to managing PDDIs that may ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). It wil also inform an R-series grant proposal to study a mature intervention that Dr. Boyce plans to submit in year 2 of the project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will impact public health by providing quantitative and qualitative pilot data that will inform the design of an intervention that should ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). The work will also provide a solid research basis for future active monitoring interventios targeting a broader set of PDDIs and other adverse events (e.g., delirium) prevalent in the NH setting.",Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr,8974794,K01AG044433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Delirium', 'Detection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Group Interviews', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Solid', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Support', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness research', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'high risk', 'hypnotic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'prototype', 'sedative', 'therapy design']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2016,113592,0.06586682373570006
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,9242212,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2016,162518,0.11217519482963846
"A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults Abstract  People aged 65+ will represent 21% of the U.S. population and increase to about 80 million by 2040, and the oldest old (age 85+) will number ~ 14.1 million. Population aging presents both opportunities and challenges for our healthcare, the economy, and existing social support systems. Many older adults especially the oldest old, minorities and those of lower Socio-Economic status (SES) are particularly vulnerable to social isolation, poor diet, and decreased levels of physical activity each of which influence morbidity and mortality. Mobile-based, tablet-based, and in-home technologies provide an excellent opportunity for projecting behavior- change interventions and social support into the everyday life of older adults at great economies of scale. The objectives of this study are to examine the usability and efficacy, for diverse older adults, of a new tablet-based dynamic system: the Fittle Senior System (FSS) that will provide: (1) personalized behavior-change programs for improved diet and increased physical activity and (2) online social interaction and support from small teams pursuing similar goals. The system builds on two technology-based systems developed by the investigative team: (1) the computer-based PRISM system, designed for older populations to support social connectivity and well-being, and (2) the Fittle+ mobile platform designed to support positive health behavior change through integrated online social support and personalized coaching based on artificial intelligence (AI). The study will be conducted in two phases. During Phase 1 we will develop and pilot test the FSS with representative samples of older adults. Phase 2 will involve a two group randomized trial where participants will be randomized to the Fittle Senior System (FSS, an adaptive coaching and social support system using mobile technology) or to a paper-based psycho-educational (BPE) control condition following a baseline assessment. The duration of the intervention phase will involve an active 12-week intervention phase followed by a 12-week maintenance phase. We will recruit and randomize 180 community dwelling adults aged 65+ years, who live alone and are at risk for social isolation (90 per condition - 30 White Caucasians, 30 Black/African Americans and 30 Hispanic Americans). We will recruit males and females commensurate to the gender proportions represented in this age group and work to ensure that we have sufficient representation from the “oldest old” cohort. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3mths post active intervention and 3mths post maintenance (6mths following active intervention) on clinically significant measures of health and health behaviors and indices of social support. We will also gather information on potential moderating (e.g., ethnicity, age) and mediating variables (e.g., health self-efficacy), which will be examined using multilevel modeling techniques guided by current theories of behavior change and technology acceptance and use among older adults. Project Narrative This proposed project is addressing a critical public concern. The population is aging and chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are common among older adults especially ethnic minorities. This study will develop and evaluate a mobile technology-based intervention designed to support positive health behavior change among diverse older adults through integrated online social support, personalized coaching and goal setting.",A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults,9147924,R01AG053163,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caucasians', 'Chronic', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational Materials', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Industry', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Jordan', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Older Population', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Self Efficacy', 'Social Interaction', 'Social isolation', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Support System', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'active method', 'age group', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinically significant', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'dynamic system', 'education research', 'efficacy trial', 'ethnic minority population', 'family structure', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'low socioeconomic status', 'male', 'medical schools', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'nutrition', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2016,834282,0.12250430798267131
"Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of elderly who cannot maintain functional independence in their own homes is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, gaps in our knowledge base concerning how to scale and validate activity recognition and health assessment technologies currently limit clinical translation of smart environments for real-time health monitoring and intervention. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this renewal application is to design, evaluate and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide automated health assessment and support real-time interventions. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. We hypothesize that many older adults who require support completing everyday activities can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Building on our pioneering prior work and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) expand and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities and provide automated functional assessment to encompass a greater number of behaviors and more diverse older adult population; (2) develop and validate software algorithms that provide automated health assessment by partnering actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment with in-home smart home data; (3) develop technologies to provide data-driven context-aware automated prompts; and (4) investigate methods for visualizing and integrating clinically-relevant smart home health data into personal and electronic health records. The proposed work is innovative because it partners real-time methodologies and defines methods of detecting and coping with aging and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. This work is significant because it provides the basis for technologies that will keep older adults with functional impairment in their homes and monitor frail older individuals from afar. The outcome of this work will result in automated health assessments that make use of smart technology, recommendations for improving the ecological validity of office-based clinical assessments, automated real-time intervention methods that can help support preventative health care measures, and clinically-relevant, user-friendly interfaces for integration of smart home data into health records. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smar home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to gather validated activity and health related information that can be used by the medical community to improve the efficacy of traditional assessment and support ecological momentary intervention techniques. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance,9103121,R01EB009675,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive healthcare', 'Progress Reports', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Software Design', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'computer science', 'coping', 'cost effective', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'sensor', 'social', 'technology development', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,333930,0.12163017822485271
"NRI: Collaborative Research: Quadrupedal Human-Assistive Robotic Platform (Q-HARP) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed project aims at developing a novel quadrupedal human-assistive robotic platform (Q-HARP}, with the objective of helping the large number of elderly individuals live a healthy, physically active life style. The Q-HARP primarily functions as a smart power-assist walker: a user, situated in the center of the legged robot, can enjoy the desired amount of power assist in walking according to his/her intent. As such, a Q-HARP user is able to perform an appropriate amount of physical activity, while enjoying the enhanced level of mobility during his/her daily lif. Furthermore, with the Q-HARP's legged motion, the human-robot system can easily overcome most obstacles in the daily life. With this capability, the Q-HARP has a potential of becoming a basic building block for Aging-in-Place, enabling elderly individuals to stay in their home longer without conducting costly modification to their existing home structures. To develop this innovative robot, the investigators will conduct research in various aspects of the project. The specific aims of the project are: AIM 1) Understand user needs and promote user involvement in the research process; AIM 2) Create a systematic design framework for the human-assistive quadrupedal robot, and build robot prototypes for experimental testing; AIM 3) Develop a 3D computer vision-based approach for motion and environment detection; AIM 4) Study the human assistive strategies in assistive walking and emergency response; AIM 5) Develop an intelligent robot control system for interactive assistance in locomotion; AIM 6) Conduct experiments to test the robot performance in human assistance tasks. The project's potential bene*fits to society are substantial. By 2030, there will be 71 million older adults living in the S, accounting for 20°/o of the entire population. For the health and well ness of older adults, a key contributing factor is to be physically active. However, a large number of older adults have significant difficulty in staying physically active due to mobility impairment. By providing desire physical assistance in the coordinated locomotion, the Q-HARP is anticipated to restore an elderly person's mobility, keep him/her physically active, and enjoy a more healthy life with reduced reliance on the assistance of caregivers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The human-assistive robotic platform in this proposal has a potential of promoting and improving the health and well ness of the large elderly population in the US, and thus is in direct support of NINR's mission. Specifically, it fits well into the theme of ""Wellness: Promoting Health and Preventing Illness"" by helping elderly individuals to stay physically active and prevent the illnesses associated with the sedentary lifestyle.",NRI: Collaborative Research: Quadrupedal Human-Assistive Robotic Platform (Q-HARP),9132846,R01NR016151,"['Accounting', 'Aging', 'Caregivers', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Emergency response', 'Environment', 'Equine mule', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Locomotion', 'Mental Depression', 'Mission', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Side', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Walkers', 'Walking', 'aging population', 'base', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'robot control', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R01,2016,125000,0.0823104326818905
"A New Paradigm for Hypertension in the Elderly- Beyond Age DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 60% of adults age � 65 years have high blood pressure (BP), but optimal management of high BP in the elderly remains controversial. Contrary to evidence in middle age that lowering BP is clearly beneficial, data in older adults are inconsistent and high BP may not be a risk factor in all elders. We recently reported that, among participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey age e65 years, high BP was a risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) death only among persons in better health status (defined as fast walking of a 20-ft walk test). In contrast, high BP was not a risk factor among slow walkers. Additionally, the benefit of lowering BP in all elders remains an issue of debate; a recent meta-analysis in persons age 80 years and older reported no benefit of BP treatment on mortality, and significant heterogeneity across trials. Finally, there is growin concern for potential harms associated with treatment to lower BP. Excessive lowering of BP, particularly diastolic, has been associated with increased risk for death and cardiovascular events in some studies. In the proposed research, we propose a novel paradigm where the associations of BP with adverse outcomes in older persons are considered in the setting of the complex aging process. Our long-term goal is to reliably identify elderly persons in whom BP treatment is beneficial and those in whom treatment is ineffective or even harmful, by defining subpopulations of similar health status. Specifically, aim 1 proposes to elucidate factors from four domains (functional, cognitive/mental, self-rated health, and physiologic) that can identify elderly persons in whom high systolic BP is strongly associated with higher risk for death and CV events, and those in whom it is not, using data from three NIH-funded cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) and Sacramento Area Latino Study of Aging (SALSA). In aim 2, we will evaluate the role of diastolic BP across level of health status. Finally, based on findings from these observational cohorts, in aim 3 we will evaluate whether these factors can identify elderly persons in whom treatment to lower BP is of maximum benefit in two randomized controlled trials: the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly (SHEP) and the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3). Since participants in trials are healthier than the U.S. population, we will also evaluate the effect of treatment in the observational studies, using state-of-the-art causal inference methods, which can correct for the bias of standard analytic approaches. Completion of these aims will substantially advance our understanding of the importance of high BP in older adults; will improve our ability to identify elderly persons who will benefit from BP treatment; will allow a systematic understanding of groups in whom evidence for BP treatment is lacking; and will guide design of future trials of hypertension in elderly adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Treatment of high blood pressure in elderly persons remains controversial. This proposal focuses on developing systematic methods to understand which elderly persons benefit from lowering blood pressure. This question is of great relevance as U.S. elders are living longer than any prior generation, and the majority have high blood pressure.",A New Paradigm for Hypertension in the Elderly- Beyond Age,8925759,R01AG046206,"['Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Aging-Related Process', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Hypotension', 'Individual', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walkers', 'Walking', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'blood pressure reduction', 'cardiovascular health', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'evidence base', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'novel', 'systolic hypertension', 'treatment effect']",NIA,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2016,309383,0.07909868329038004
"Working Memory Training in Older Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that cognitive interventions targeting working memory are beneficial in that they show generalizing effects that go beyond what has been specifically trained, i.e. transfer effects. Although it seems more difficult to observe such transfer effects in older adults as compared to young adults or children, we and others have found that some interventions do show promise in older populations. Despite the promising results, more research is needed to make our interventions more effective and more robust, and to uncover the underlying mechanisms of training in an aging population. For our proposed studies, we envision two lines of research with different goals: First, we aim to address questions of pragmatics. Our goal here is to make our intervention more accessible and inviting for participants, thus increasing their motivation to participate effectively in training regimens. In addition, we will investigate the intervention's optimal scheduling (i.e., spacing of practice), and explore whether the improvements extend to measures of everyday functioning, and finally, investigate longitudinal effects and their trajectories over the course of one year after training completion. These are our applied goals. Second, we propose to address the most important questions of any intervention research: The investigation of the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms of improvement. Furthermore, we will shed light on individual differences as moderating factors for training success. These are our mechanistic goals. Given the sparse availability of effective cognitive interventions, and the limited knowledge about their generalizing effects to applied measures of daily living, the proposed work will have important implications in that it will shed more light on the mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in old age, and serve as groundwork for future large-scale randomized clinical trials and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The vast majority of our nation's aging population will experience some decline in cognitive function with age. Therefore, the development of effective preventative interventions to mitigate age-related cognitive decline is of critical importance in that those interventions could not only impact older adults' cognitive and daily life functioning, but ultimately, contribute to their well-being and quality of life. The proposed work will have important implications in that it will get at the underlying mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in ld age, and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted cognitive interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia.",Working Memory Training in Older Adults,9145147,R01AG049006,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Financial compensation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Motivation', 'Older Population', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Populations at Risk', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Schedule', 'Self Efficacy', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specificity', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'active control', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'computerized', 'design', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'success', 'therapy design', 'usability', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2016,606591,0.060416910720712765
"Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses neuroimaging to enrich our understanding of the impact of negative aging stereotypes on cognitive performance in older adults - a phenomenon known as ""stereotype threat"". We will identify task-related brain activity associated with stereotype threat, and the extent to which individual beliefs in memory ability, stereotype self-relevance, and anxiety mediate these neural effects. We also will test two hypothesized mechanisms of threat, using traditional fMRI methods and novel pattern classifier techniques. This project will inform theories of ageist stereotype threat at the psychological and neural level, which is critical for disentangling the effects of aging-related neural decline and social factors on brain activity. The impact of stereotype threat on cognitive tests has significan public health implications, not only for cognitive functioning in daily life, but because cognitive tests are used to diagnose the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. To the extent that threat impairs performance on these tests, an individual's true cognitive ability would be underestimated. In our study, cognitively normal older adults will be explicitly exposed to negative stereotypes about aging memory (threat condition) or a positive, age-fair framing of the task (control condition). Next, during fMRI, they will take a recollection task known to be sensitive to aging stereotype threat effects. The neural mechanisms of stereotype threat will be determined by directly comparing brain activity between the threat and control groups, as well as comparisons to brain activity in younger adult groups that are tested in conditions that simulate the cognitive processes thought to drive stereotype threat. In determining which neural mechanisms drive stereotype threat in aging populations, we hope to minimize the negative impact of ageist stereotypes on older adults, in daily cognitive routines and in medical settings where cognitive tests are used for diagnosis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research studies ageist stereotype effects on cognition, using psychological measures and neuroimaging to identify the causes of stereotype effects in different people. Understanding stereotypes can help individuals avoid them, thereby increasing the well-being of older adults.            ",Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition,9061560,R21AG049931,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Belief', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stereotyping', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age difference', 'age related', 'anxiety states', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'emotion regulation', 'expectation', 'interest', 'mental state', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'social', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2016,197500,0.0456201936671549
"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,9012784,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'aging population', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'support network', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2016,2214679,0.08266191011553725
"Chronic Conditions and Mutuality of Care in Late Life Marriage:A Multi-method App DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% experience functional disability. Thus, married older adults are not only likely to cope with chronic conditios and disability of their own but also their spouse's. Understanding how support dynamics in marriage influence each partner's health will provide great insight into helping couples stay healthier and functionally independent into late life. The aim of the proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (MRSDA) is to train the candidate in epidemiology of aging and advanced dyadic data analysis techniques to build on her expertise in experimental research and to understand how mutual care in late-life marriage influence health, particularly cardiovascular health and depression, and longevity. The proposed research focuses on older couples in which both partners suffer from chronic conditions and disability, and drawing from communal relationships theory, mutual care is defined as both partners receiving high levels of balanced instrumental and emotional support from one another. Through this MRSDA, the candidate will (1) learn from expert mentors and consultants about the epidemiology of aging and advanced statistical techniques to analyze dyadic, longitudinal data, (2) conduct secondary analysis on a large epidemiologic dyadic data set to examine how mutual care in older adult marriages influences long-term health and longevity and an experiment to examine a proposed mechanism, cardiovascular stress recovery, (3) complete coursework in epidemiology of aging, advanced epidemiologic statistics, and research ethics, and (4) attend workshops on dyadic data analysis. Yale University is a phenomenal environment to pursue this training as it has extensive resources in epidemiology of aging, statistics for analyzing epidemiologic data, experimental relationships research, and cardiovascular psychophysiology. The candidate has a state-of-the- art observational and psychophysiology lab that she will utilize for this project. Th Yale School of Public Health and the Claude D. Pepper Older American's Independence Center at Yale have excellent junior faculty mentoring programs. The candidate's primary mentor, Dr. Becca Levy at Yale School of Public Health has extensive expertise in bridging experimental and epidemiological methods to study psychosocial factors and health in older adults, including dyads. Dr. Richard Schulz will serve as a co-mentor, as he is the primary investigator for the Cardiovascular Health Effects Study which will be used for Study 1 of the proposed research and is an expert in conducting large, longitudinal studies. Dr. Trace Kershaw, an expert in dyadic data analysis at Yale School of Public Health, will also be a co-mentor. The proposed training will occur in the context of (1) a longitudinal study of married couples in which both members of the couple have chronic conditions and disability (Study 1; The Caregiver Health Effects Study; n=819 couples; an ancillary study to the Cardiovascular Health Study) examining the influence of mutual support on health trajectories (e.g. clinical and subclinical indicators of cardiovascular disease, clinical depression, and self-reported health) and longevity, and (2) an experimental study (Study 2; n=100 couples) examining cardiovascular stress recovery, a proposed mechanism for the link between mutual care and cardiovascular health proposed in Study 1. In the experimental study each partner will discuss a health-related stressor, and mutual support will be manipulated and compared to a control and one-sided support conditions to examine the effects on cardiovascular stress recovery. Consistent with the priorities outlined by the National Institute on Aging, the proposed MRSDA has the potential to address mechanisms for links between interpersonal relationships and health in the context of aging (RFA: PA-11-128). Further, the combination of training and research will serve as a spring board for the candidate's independent research career to elucidate how interpersonal relationships influence health among older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% are functionally disabled.

"High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression Project Summary/Abstract: Depression (target disease of this proposal) affects 34 million Americans including 2 million seniors per year. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (target population of this proposal). The vascular depression hypothesis (proposed in 1998) remains the most salient theory explaining the onset and perpetuation of depression in older adults. This model is based on the observation that in older adults, white matter hyperintensities (a hallmark of small vessel disease, SVD) are associated with depression onset and perpetuation. Progress in understanding the relationship of small vessel disease with late-life depression has been stymied in part by lack of specificity of white matter hyperintensities which can represent components of edema, gliosis, ischemia, and inflammation. Traditional MR imaging is unable to distinguish between these components, and thus the specific mechanisms that contribute to depression remain unclear.  The emergence of ultrahigh field MR imaging allows for greater specificity of the WMH lesions, and other components of small vessel disease. Bringing 7 tesla (T) imaging into mainstream clinical use will be accomplished through 1) having exclusive (over 1.5/3T) application(s) and 2) achieving robust, safe, consistent, and homogenous high-quality images. Through a consortium consisting of experts at University of Pittsburgh combined with collaboration at FDA, University of Minnesota, and Quality Electrodynamics Inc., our goal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. We will achieve this goal through the development of robust radiofrequency methodology, as well as pulse sequences that produce 7T images with the aforementioned necessary attributes. This will be paired with complementary 3T MRI at baseline. We will use our recently developed (as well as a proposed) custom designed 7T radiofrequency coil system and pulse sequences that are already being used in disease/patient studies. Based on our preliminary results, the proposed RF solution will provide unprecedented homogeneity and consistency among different subjects/patients, and therefore excellent signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio for detection of components of small vessel disease. The study will examine two cohorts 1) a group of 30 older adults recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) for developing an MRI to histopathology statistical model of SVD and 2) 60 older adults with late-life depression who will undergo scanning at baseline and after 2 years. The longitudinal 7T MRI and SVD model will be used to help characterize the small vessel changes associated with depression in older adults.  In summary, this study develops an emerging and timely technology (high-performance ultrahigh field MRI) to study a critical pathophysiological process (cerebral small vessel disease) in a clinically relevant population (Late-Life Depression). This project will further advance all of these three domains. Project Narrative: The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. This will be accomplished through the development of radiofrequency hardware, methodology, pulse sequences and protocols using 7 Tesla (T) human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in conjunction with complimentary 3T MRI. The clinical relevance of the proposed tools will be achieved through comprehensive characterization of 1) components of cerebral small vessel disease in individuals with late-life depression and 2) progression of small vessel disease markers over 2 years. One of our overarching goals is to achieve a highly useful 7T clinical utility, which requires high quality, robust, and consistent acquisitions. This could be a potentially exclusive (over other human MRI field strengths) application for 7T imaging.",High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression,9196861,R01MH111265,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Consultations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Edema', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Gliosis', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Heating', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'Work', 'absorption', 'abstracting', 'aging brain', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disturbance in affect', 'follow-up', 'geriatric depression', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'radiofrequency', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'vascular depression']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,685522,0.08460583172114583
"Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults exhibit poor recovery and are at high risk for rehospitalization after acute heart failure. Current rehabilitation and clinical management strategies have shown only modest benefits because the mechanisms underlying poor outcomes remain under recognized and therefore unmitigated. The proposed study will address this critical knowledge gap by examining the role of systemic mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity as a fundamental factor underlying poor physical function in hospitalized acute decompensated heart failure, the success of rehabilitation, and the prognosis of patients following hospitalization. This will be accomplished in a highly translational and cost-effective manner as an ancillary study to REHAB-HF (R01AG045551; PI: Kitzman), a multi-center clinical trial funded by the NIA that tests the hypothesis that impaired physical function underlies adverse outcomes in older hospitalized ADHF patients and employs a novel rehabilitation program that targets multiple domains of physical function for 12 weeks beginning during hospitalization. The results of REHAB-HF can impact clinical practice; however, its outcomes do not directly address potential mechanisms of action. Mitochondrial function is likely candidate for mediating physiological decline in REHAB-HF participants, because these organelles are sensitive to a myriad of intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to aging, physical function, heart failure, and hospitalization.  Mitochondrial dysfunction across multiple tissues has been implicated in physiological decline associated with heart failure and is thought to be mediated by circulating factors that affect systemic bioenergetic capacity. Therefore, we propose that respirometric profiling of circulating cells can be used to report on systemic bioenergetic decline in heart failure patients and will be associated with physical function and long term outcomes - including rehospitalization rate. We will determine whether the REHAB-HF rehabilitation program increases bioenergetic capacity, compared to control, thereby improving functional outcomes. Bioenergetic profiling of multiple blood cell populations will enable us to identify the specific cell types and bioenergetic parameters, or patterns comprised of multiple variables, that are most closely associated with REHAB-HF outcomes such as physical function and quality of life. We will also determine the ability of blood cells to report on systemic bioenergetic decline y examining relationships with mitochondrial function measured in skeletal muscle. Successful strategies for mitigating poor physical function and improving long-term outcomes rely on the identification of mechanisms that contribute to the vulnerability of patients after discharge. Bioenergetic profiling may enable the identification of patients in need of more intensive management and targeted rehabilitation. The advancement of blood-based bioenergetic profiling will enhance the use of this promising test in future trials, and potentially, in the cliical care of older patients with the wide range of chronic medical conditions associated with physical disability and poor clinical outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will examine the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the physical function of older adults hospitalized for acute heart failure, and th long term rehabilitation outcomes of these patients. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the success of recovery will lead to improved treatment strategies that can be personalized in order to maximize benefits for individual patients. The results of this study can improve the management of older adults hospitalized with acute heart failure and will be generalizable to the broader issues of age-related bioenergetic decline and post-hospitalization syndrome.        ",Bioenergetics and Rehabilitation in Older Patients with Acute Heart Failure,9112221,R21AG051077,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Ancillary Study', 'Bioenergetics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise stress test', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Heart failure', 'Hormones', 'Hospitalization', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardium', 'Organelles', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Respiration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'exercise intolerance', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'long-term rehabilitation', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation management', 'respiratory', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2016,190640,0.04839409364433281
"Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is a stigmatized, underreported, under-diagnosed, under-treated yet common condition that negatively impacts quality of life of many older adults. UUI symptoms overlap with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), the most common infection in older adults and UUI is associated with an increased risk of UTI in both men and women. Overall success with current UUI treatment modalities remains poor and short-term. Vitamin D supplementation is a plausible intervention for UUI and UTI prevention, but few studies have examined associations between vitamin D levels and UUI and UTI. Vitamin D may influence detrusor muscle contraction by activating vitamin D receptors present in detrusor muscle and blocking the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase, a calcium-independent pathway for smooth muscle contraction. Vitamin D also stimulates production of antimicrobial peptides, which inhibit growth of bladder bacteria that may confer risk for or protection from UUI and UTI. It is now known that urine is not sterile, and that standard urine cultures fail to detect most urinary bacteria (microbiome) regardless of the amount. Present in men and women, the urinary microbiome likely influences bladder health. This study will examine the associations between vitamin D levels, the urinary microbiome, and UUI and UTI risk in both men and women across four racial/ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, the Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large racially diverse cohort of adults followed longitudinally to determine the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease and its progression. At the upcoming 15-year follow-up exam, the mean age of MESA participants will be 70-75 years; in this age group, UUI prevalence exceeds 30% in women and 15% in men. We propose to investigate the association of both current UUI status and future UTI with vitamin D and the urinary microbiome and create prediction models that incorporate both traditional (e.g. obesity, diabetes) and novel (vitamin D and urinary microbiome) risk factors for the identification of individuals at high risk or UUI and UTI. The long-term goal is to design innovative clinical trials to mitigate and prevent UUI and UTI in older men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine accompanied by a strong and urgent desire to urinate and is associated with increased risk of urinary tract infections (UTI), the second most frequent infection among older adults. UUI is extremely common among older men and women and current treatments are not successful in most patients. The Urinary KNOWledge study (U-KNOW) will use an existing racially/ethnically diverse and clinically well-characterized cohort to investigate the association of current UUI status and future UTI with risk factors, both established (e.g., obesity and diabetes) and novel (i.e., vitamin D and the urinary microbiome) and create prediction models that identify individuals at high risk for UUI and UTI.

"In-home monitoring system for assessing gait using wall-mounted RF transceivers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a new system called GaitRF that can measure walking speed and other detailed gait parameters passively within the home. The ability to move is a critical function that underlies the quality of life for elders as well as those suffering from neurologic or physical ailments. Changes in aspects of gait such as walking speed, stride length, stride imbalance, etc. have been shown to correlate with changes in physical and cognitive health. Gait is typically measured periodically within a clinical setting. In-home monitoring offers the advantage of continuous and ongoing measurements providing significantly more information about changes in a patient's health under real life conditions. Ongoing accurate estimation of gait within the home can help to guide caregivers about the need for transitioning older adults to higher levels of care. Accurate in-home gait monitoring also has the potential to encourage older adults to maintain independence later into their lives by enabling family members and friends to monitor health status remotely.  The proposed system makes use of novel wireless technology being developed at EmbedRF. An array of tiny transceivers are positioned in either a hallway or doorframe and configured to wirelessly send radio frequency (RF) signals between each other. As a person walks past the transceivers, their body disrupts the RF signal strength allowing for the estimation of gait metric without the need for the person to wear any monitoring device. Preliminary results using only 2 or 4 transceivers have already demonstrated the ability to accurately estimate walking speed. Preliminary results also show the unique ability to discriminate between individuals for use in a multi-resident home or to exclude data when a caregiver or friend visits. Specific aims in this proposal will 1) further develop prototype systems for walking speed estimation using transceiver pairs, 2) research and develop use of an array of sensors placed at base-board height in order to extract more detailed gait metrics; a second transceiver pair will be placed at approximate head height to provide multi-person discrimination capability, and 3) perform preliminary in-home evaluations of the GaitRF system. Advanced machine learning and tracking algorithms will be utilized to process the RF signals to extract gait metrics. We will evaluate the performance of GaitRF in both a laboratory setting and within single-resident and multi- resident homes of seniors.  If successful, this new system has the advantage of being low-cost, unobtrusive, and easy to install, while still providing accurate and detailed gait metrics. The system can be used as a stand-alone gait monitor or incorporated into more general health monitoring systems. Application of the technology will support independent living and may also be used in clinical trials of drugs or procedures that affect mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to move is a critical function that underlies the quality of life for elders as well as individuals suffering from cognitive or physical impairment. Changes in aspects of gait such as walking speed, stride length, stride imbalance, etc. have been shown to correlate with changes in physical and cognitive health. We propose to develop a low cost system called GaitRF that can passively and unobtrusively measure detailed gait metrics in the home to support monitoring of seniors living independently or at an assisted living facility.            ",In-home monitoring system for assessing gait using wall-mounted RF transceivers,8904402,R43AG049573,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Family member', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Friends', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Height', 'Home environment', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Leg', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Width', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'improved', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'particle', 'physical conditioning', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'signal processing']",NIA,"EMBEDRF, LLC",R43,2015,225000,0.04649379636859033
"Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults spend over 8 hours per day sitting, more than any other age group. High sedentary time has now been associated with adverse health impacts (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease related mortality) independent from physical activity. This suggests that research explicitly focusing on sedentary behavior is warranted. To further the field of sedentary behavior research among older adults with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, three gaps will be addressed: 1) improving measures of sedentary time using advanced technology-based methods (due to limitations of self-reports and traditional accelerometer data processing techniques); 2) understanding relationships between sedentary time and cardio-metabolic biomarkers and health conditions; and, 3) developing technology-based interventions to reduce sedentary time. The iSTAND (Investigating Sedentary Time in Aging: New Directions using technology) Project aims to address these gaps using data from 3 rich sources (Successful Aging Evaluation [SAGE] Study, the Women's Health Initiative [WHI] Long Life Study, and a participant pool from a large integrated health care system). In the first research aim, objective measurement techniques for sedentary time (e.g. accelerometers, SenseCam, machine learning algorithms) are explored (Aim 1a), and machine learning algorithms for accelerometer data are applied to the WHI sample to examine relationships between sedentary time and health risk factors among older women (Aim 1b). In Aim 2, focus groups will be conducted to inform development of a technology-based sedentary time reduction program targeting older adults with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease. In a pilot intervention, the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be tested in 40 older aduls with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease from a large integrated health care system. The research plans dovetail with training plans for Dr. Rosenberg to obtain necessary skills and knowledge in 2 key areas where she has deficits: 1) wireless technologies to measure sedentary time more accurately, and, 2) application of wireless technologies to sedentary time reduction interventions among older adults. The project will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors (bioinformatics, technology and measurement, geriatrics, statistics) and knowledge obtained through training experiences, coursework, and conferences. Support from this 4-year patient-oriented research career development award will position Dr. Rosenberg to lead an independent research program in using technology decrease sedentary time among older adults with chronic health conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sedentary behaviors (activities done in a seated or lying down position, such as watching television) are associated with many adverse health impacts. Older adults with chronic conditions engage in high levels of sedentary time, yet sedentary time is an understudied behavioral risk. This project will leverage technology advancements to measure sedentary time and examine relationships with health risk factors. It will also develop a technology-based program to reduce sedentary time and support healthy aging in the growing population of older adults with chronic health conditions.",Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND),8919443,K23HL119352,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Glucose', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hour', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Preparation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Wireless Technology', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolic risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'frailty', 'group intervention', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light intensity', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'older women', 'patient oriented research', 'population based', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'sedentary', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'tool', 'tv watching']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,K23,2015,140097,0.1548085327222799
"Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] needed for older adults to maintain optimal physical function is unknown. Institute of Medicine and Endocrine Society have publicly debated on 20 ng/mL or 30 ng/mL, respectively, as targets for skeletal health, but both groups agree that stronger evidence is needed to identify target concentrations for extra-skeletal outcomes, e.g., falls and physical function. The problem is significant: >25% of older adults have poor physical function, 50% have 25(OH)D concentrations between 20 and 30 ng/mL. Identifying 25(OH)D targets for older adults will have immediate impact by informing design and analysis of vitamin D supplementation trials. Namely, targets serve as inclusion/exclusion criteria or baseline subgroups and as secondary outcomes. Our solution is to empirically identify and validate sex-specific (possibly stratified by other factors; e.g., race, genetic variants) 25(OH)D targets in older adults (= 65 years) related to lowe risk of falls and better physical function using existing NIH-funded datasets. A critical challenge is that 25(OH)D cannot be randomized; therefore observational data are a crucial part of the solution. Conventional statistical methods are ill-equipped for this problem; thus, we will develop novel statistical methods by adapting and refining structural modeling and machine-learning methods, and apply them to our aims. We will carry out the aims using 4 prospective cohort studies comprising >12,500 older adults: Health, Aging, and Body Composition, Invecchiare in Chianti, Osteoporotic Fractures in Men, and Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. We will: 1) identify and validate 25(OH)D targets for falls reduction, mobility, activities of daily living, and instrumental activities of daily living (functional outcomes); and gait speed, muscle strength, and frailty (proximal conditions) (aim 1); 2) characterize the joint impact of 25(OH)D and serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations on functional outcomes/proximal conditions (aim 2); and 3) quantify mediation of 25(OH)D on functional outcomes/proximal conditions by endocrine and metabolic factors (PTH, serum alkaline phosphatase, aklotho, fibroblast growth factor 23) (aim 3). We will write code in SAS and R statistical languages and disseminate it to the scientific community for use in additional research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aging of the population is expected to lead to an increased burden of poor physical function and loss of independence. Low concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] are common in older adults and may be one reason for deficits in physical function. Since 25(OH)D can easily be increased by sunlight exposure, diet, and supplements; identifying and validating a target 25(OH)D for functional outcomes in older adults can have a significant impact on public health.                ",Statistical methods for vitamin D targets for functional outcomes in older adults,8885952,R01AG048069,"['25-hydroxyvitamin D', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Composition', 'Body mass index', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dietary intake', 'Elderly', 'Endocrine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hormones', 'Independent Living', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intake', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Parathyroid gland', 'Phosphorus', 'Physical Function', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Solutions', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Subgroup', 'Sun Exposure', 'Supplementation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vitamin D', 'Woman', 'Writing', 'bone', 'bone health', 'calcium intake', 'cohort', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'flexibility', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic variant', 'inclusion criteria', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'men', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'outcome forecast', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sarcopenia', 'secondary outcome', 'sex', 'skeletal', 'ultraviolet']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2015,356753,0.12305412919844659
"Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Richard D. Boyce, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh. He has training in informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and comparative effectiveness research as well as a strong commitment to improving medication safety for older adults. His prior work has focused on artificial intelligence methods for predicting drug-drug interactions and the comparative safety of antidepressants for treating de-pressed nursing home residents. The current proposal is for a three year Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) from the National Institute on Aging for training and support that will address gaps in his knowledge of aging research and the nursing home setting. In collaboration with his mentoring team (Drs. Charles Reynolds, Jordan Karp, and Steven Handler) he has developed a training and research plan that will both fill in these knowledge gaps and prepare him for an independent research career. The overarching goal of his K01 is to become an expert on how to effectively translate research results from pharmacoepidemiology and comparative effectiveness research to informatics interventions that improve medication safety for older adults, especially nursing home residents. To accomplish this goal, he proposes eight career development activities and two research aims that will help him 1) obtain rigorous training in the science and practice of creating clinical decision support interventions that are effective in the nursing home setting; 2) obtain a thorough understanding of how falls and fall risk factors are detected, monitored, reported, and assessed in the nursing home setting; and 3) learn the perceptions of multiple nursing home clinician stakeholders on what research is needed to help reduce medication-related adverse events. The two research aims will enable him to integrate and apply the knowledge that he will gain through the proposed training activities by exploring the feasibility and potential clinical usefulness of actively monitoring patients exposed to psycho- tropic PDDIs. The approach would use electronic data available in most United States (US) NHs to provide highly specific and actionable alerts to physicians and/or nurses when a resident who is exposed to a PDDI involving a psychotropic drug transitions to a state of unacceptably high risk for experiencing a fall. Dr. Boyce's hypothesis is that this approach will extend the ability of NH clinicians to perform the recommended ""diligent monitoring"" of PDDIs, while avoiding alert fatigue. He anticipates that the approach would be generalizable to other prevalent NH ADEs (e.g., delirium) and other drug classes (e.g., mood stabilizers). This proposal is relevant to public health because it will explore an innovative approach to managing PDDIs that may ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). It wil also inform an R-series grant proposal to study a mature intervention that Dr. Boyce plans to submit in year 2 of the project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will impact public health by providing quantitative and qualitative pilot data that will inform the design of an intervention that should ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). The work will also provide a solid research basis for future active monitoring interventios targeting a broader set of PDDIs and other adverse events (e.g., delirium) prevalent in the NH setting.",Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr,8776906,K01AG044433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Delirium', 'Detection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Group Interviews', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Solid', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Support', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness research', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'high risk', 'hypnotic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'prototype', 'sedative', 'therapy design']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2015,114082,0.06586682373570006
"NRI: Collaborative Research: Quadrupedal Human-Assistive Robotic Platform (Q-HARP) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed project aims at developing a novel quadrupedal human-assistive robotic platform (Q-HARP}, with the objective of helping the large number of elderly individuals live a healthy, physically active life style. The Q-HARP primarily functions as a smart power-assist walker: a user, situated in the center of the legged robot, can enjoy the desired amount of power assist in walking according to his/her intent. As such, a Q-HARP user is able to perform an appropriate amount of physical activity, while enjoying the enhanced level of mobility during his/her daily lif. Furthermore, with the Q-HARP's legged motion, the human-robot system can easily overcome most obstacles in the daily life. With this capability, the Q-HARP has a potential of becoming a basic building block for Aging-in-Place, enabling elderly individuals to stay in their home longer without conducting costly modification to their existing home structures. To develop this innovative robot, the investigators will conduct research in various aspects of the project. The specific aims of the project are: AIM 1) Understand user needs and promote user involvement in the research process; AIM 2) Create a systematic design framework for the human-assistive quadrupedal robot, and build robot prototypes for experimental testing; AIM 3) Develop a 3D computer vision-based approach for motion and environment detection; AIM 4) Study the human assistive strategies in assistive walking and emergency response; AIM 5) Develop an intelligent robot control system for interactive assistance in locomotion; AIM 6) Conduct experiments to test the robot performance in human assistance tasks. The project's potential bene*fits to society are substantial. By 2030, there will be 71 million older adults living in the S, accounting for 20°/o of the entire population. For the health and well ness of older adults, a key contributing factor is to be physically active. However, a large number of older adults have significant difficulty in staying physically active due to mobility impairment. By providing desire physical assistance in the coordinated locomotion, the Q-HARP is anticipated to restore an elderly person's mobility, keep him/her physically active, and enjoy a more healthy life with reduced reliance on the assistance of caregivers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:          The human-assistive robotic platform in this proposal has a potential of promoting and improving the health and well ness of the large elderly population in the US, and thus is in direct support of NINR's mission. Specifically, it fits well into the theme of ""Wellness: Promoting Health and Preventing Illness"" by helping elderly individuals to stay physically active and prevent the illnesses associated with the sedentary lifestyle.",NRI: Collaborative Research: Quadrupedal Human-Assistive Robotic Platform (Q-HARP),9052390,R01NR016151,"['Accounting', 'Aging', 'Caregivers', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Elderly', 'Emergency response', 'Environment', 'Equine mule', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Locomotion', 'Mental Depression', 'Mission', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Side', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Walkers', 'Walking', 'base', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sedentary lifestyle']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R01,2015,125000,0.0823104326818905
"Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project uses neuroimaging to enrich our understanding of the impact of negative aging stereotypes on cognitive performance in older adults - a phenomenon known as ""stereotype threat"". We will identify task-related brain activity associated with stereotype threat, and the extent to which individual beliefs in memory ability, stereotype self-relevance, and anxiety mediate these neural effects. We also will test two hypothesized mechanisms of threat, using traditional fMRI methods and novel pattern classifier techniques. This project will inform theories of ageist stereotype threat at the psychological and neural level, which is critical for disentangling the effects of aging-related neural decline and social factors on brain activity. The impact of stereotype threat on cognitive tests has significan public health implications, not only for cognitive functioning in daily life, but because cognitive tests are used to diagnose the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. To the extent that threat impairs performance on these tests, an individual's true cognitive ability would be underestimated. In our study, cognitively normal older adults will be explicitly exposed to negative stereotypes about aging memory (threat condition) or a positive, age-fair framing of the task (control condition). Next, during fMRI, they will take a recollection task known to be sensitive to aging stereotype threat effects. The neural mechanisms of stereotype threat will be determined by directly comparing brain activity between the threat and control groups, as well as comparisons to brain activity in younger adult groups that are tested in conditions that simulate the cognitive processes thought to drive stereotype threat. In determining which neural mechanisms drive stereotype threat in aging populations, we hope to minimize the negative impact of ageist stereotypes on older adults, in daily cognitive routines and in medical settings where cognitive tests are used for diagnosis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research studies ageist stereotype effects on cognition, using psychological measures and neuroimaging to identify the causes of stereotype effects in different people. Understanding stereotypes can help individuals avoid them, thereby increasing the well-being of older adults.            ",Neural Mechanisms of Aging Stereotypes on Cognition,8868661,R21AG049931,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Belief', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stereotyping', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age difference', 'age related', 'anxiety states', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'emotion regulation', 'expectation', 'interest', 'mental state', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sample fixation', 'social', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2015,237000,0.0456201936671549
"Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of elderly who cannot maintain functional independence in their own homes is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, gaps in our knowledge base concerning how to scale and validate activity recognition and health assessment technologies currently limit clinical translation of smart environments for real-time health monitoring and intervention. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this renewal application is to design, evaluate and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide automated health assessment and support real-time interventions. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. We hypothesize that many older adults who require support completing everyday activities can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Building on our pioneering prior work and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) expand and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities and provide automated functional assessment to encompass a greater number of behaviors and more diverse older adult population; (2) develop and validate software algorithms that provide automated health assessment by partnering actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment with in-home smart home data; (3) develop technologies to provide data-driven context-aware automated prompts; and (4) investigate methods for visualizing and integrating clinically-relevant smart home health data into personal and electronic health records. The proposed work is innovative because it partners real-time methodologies and defines methods of detecting and coping with aging and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. This work is significant because it provides the basis for technologies that will keep older adults with functional impairment in their homes and monitor frail older individuals from afar. The outcome of this work will result in automated health assessments that make use of smart technology, recommendations for improving the ecological validity of office-based clinical assessments, automated real-time intervention methods that can help support preventative health care measures, and clinically-relevant, user-friendly interfaces for integration of smart home data into health records. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smar home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to gather validated activity and health related information that can be used by the medical community to improve the efficacy of traditional assessment and support ecological momentary intervention techniques. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance,8935770,R01EB009675,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Progress Reports', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Software Design', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'computer science', 'coping', 'cost effective', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'novel', 'sensor', 'social', 'technology development', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,327802,0.12163017822485271
"Working Memory Training in Older Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is accumulating evidence that cognitive interventions targeting working memory are beneficial in that they show generalizing effects that go beyond what has been specifically trained, i.e. transfer effects. Although it seems more difficult to observe such transfer effects in older adults as compared to young adults or children, we and others have found that some interventions do show promise in older populations. Despite the promising results, more research is needed to make our interventions more effective and more robust, and to uncover the underlying mechanisms of training in an aging population. For our proposed studies, we envision two lines of research with different goals: First, we aim to address questions of pragmatics. Our goal here is to make our intervention more accessible and inviting for participants, thus increasing their motivation to participate effectively in training regimens. In addition, we will investigate the intervention's optimal scheduling (i.e., spacing of practice), and explore whether the improvements extend to measures of everyday functioning, and finally, investigate longitudinal effects and their trajectories over the course of one year after training completion. These are our applied goals. Second, we propose to address the most important questions of any intervention research: The investigation of the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms of improvement. Furthermore, we will shed light on individual differences as moderating factors for training success. These are our mechanistic goals. Given the sparse availability of effective cognitive interventions, and the limited knowledge about their generalizing effects to applied measures of daily living, the proposed work will have important implications in that it will shed more light on the mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in old age, and serve as groundwork for future large-scale randomized clinical trials and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The vast majority of our nation's aging population will experience some decline in cognitive function with age. Therefore, the development of effective preventative interventions to mitigate age-related cognitive decline is of critical importance in that those interventions could not only impact older adults' cognitive and daily life functioning, but ultimately, contribute to their well-being and quality of life. The proposed work will have important implications in that it will get at the underlying mechanisms of cognitive plasticity in ld age, and inform future research investigating the efficacy of targeted cognitive interventions in populations that are at risk for dementia.            ",Working Memory Training in Older Adults,8907211,R01AG049006,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Financial compensation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Motivation', 'Older Population', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Populations at Risk', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Schedule', 'Self Efficacy', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specificity', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'active control', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'computerized', 'design', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'success', 'therapy design', 'usability', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2015,602211,0.060416910720712765
"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,8786533,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2015,2302752,0.08266191011553725
"Chronic Conditions and Mutuality of Care in Late Life Marriage:A Multi-method App DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% experience functional disability. Thus, married older adults are not only likely to cope with chronic conditios and disability of their own but also their spouse's. Understanding how support dynamics in marriage influence each partner's health will provide great insight into helping couples stay healthier and functionally independent into late life. The aim of the proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (MRSDA) is to train the candidate in epidemiology of aging and advanced dyadic data analysis techniques to build on her expertise in experimental research and to understand how mutual care in late-life marriage influence health, particularly cardiovascular health and depression, and longevity. The proposed research focuses on older couples in which both partners suffer from chronic conditions and disability, and drawing from communal relationships theory, mutual care is defined as both partners receiving high levels of balanced instrumental and emotional support from one another. Through this MRSDA, the candidate will (1) learn from expert mentors and consultants about the epidemiology of aging and advanced statistical techniques to analyze dyadic, longitudinal data, (2) conduct secondary analysis on a large epidemiologic dyadic data set to examine how mutual care in older adult marriages influences long-term health and longevity and an experiment to examine a proposed mechanism, cardiovascular stress recovery, (3) complete coursework in epidemiology of aging, advanced epidemiologic statistics, and research ethics, and (4) attend workshops on dyadic data analysis.

"Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older adults spend over 8 hours per day sitting, more than any other age group. High sedentary time has now been associated with adverse health impacts (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease related mortality) independent from physical activity. This suggests that research explicitly focusing on sedentary behavior is warranted. To further the field of sedentary behavior research among older adults with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, three gaps will be addressed: 1) improving measures of sedentary time using advanced technology-based methods (due to limitations of self-reports and traditional accelerometer data processing techniques); 2) understanding relationships between sedentary time and cardio-metabolic biomarkers and health conditions; and, 3) developing technology-based interventions to reduce sedentary time. The iSTAND (Investigating Sedentary Time in Aging: New Directions using technology) Project aims to address these gaps using data from 3 rich sources (Successful Aging Evaluation [SAGE] Study, the Women's Health Initiative [WHI] Long Life Study, and a participant pool from a large integrated health care system). In the first research aim, objective measurement techniques for sedentary time (e.g. accelerometers, SenseCam, machine learning algorithms) are explored (Aim 1a), and machine learning algorithms for accelerometer data are applied to the WHI sample to examine relationships between sedentary time and health risk factors among older women (Aim 1b). In Aim 2, focus groups will be conducted to inform development of a technology-based sedentary time reduction program targeting older adults with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease. In a pilot intervention, the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be tested in 40 older aduls with obesity, diabetes, and/or cardiovascular disease from a large integrated health care system. The research plans dovetail with training plans for Dr. Rosenberg to obtain necessary skills and knowledge in 2 key areas where she has deficits: 1) wireless technologies to measure sedentary time more accurately, and, 2) application of wireless technologies to sedentary time reduction interventions among older adults. The project will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors (bioinformatics, technology and measurement, geriatrics, statistics) and knowledge obtained through training experiences, coursework, and conferences. Support from this 4-year patient-oriented research career development award will position Dr. Rosenberg to lead an independent research program in using technology decrease sedentary time among older adults with chronic health conditions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sedentary behaviors (activities done in a seated or lying down position, such as watching television) are associated with many adverse health impacts. Older adults with chronic conditions engage in high levels of sedentary time, yet sedentary time is an understudied behavioral risk. This project will leverage technology advancements to measure sedentary time and examine relationships with health risk factors. It will also develop a technology-based program to reduce sedentary time and support healthy aging in the growing population of older adults with chronic health conditions.            ",Investigating Sedentary Time In Aging: New Directions Using Technology (iSTAND),8696515,K23HL119352,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elderly', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Glucose', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Hour', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Preparation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Wireless Technology', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'frailty', 'group intervention', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'light intensity', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'older women', 'patient oriented research', 'population based', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'satisfaction', 'sedentary', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'time use', 'tool', 'tv watching']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,K23,2014,143504,0.1548085327222799
"Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Richard D. Boyce, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh. He has training in informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and comparative effectiveness research as well as a strong commitment to improving medication safety for older adults. His prior work has focused on artificial intelligence methods for predicting drug-drug interactions and the comparative safety of  antidepressants for treating de- pressed nursing home residents. The current proposal is for a three year Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) from the National Institute on Aging for training and support that will address gaps in his knowledge of aging research and the nursing home setting. In collaboration with his mentoring team (Drs. Charles Reynolds, Jordan Karp, and Steven Handler) he has developed a training and research plan that will both fill in these knowledge gaps and prepare him for an independent research career. The overarching goal of his K01 is to become an expert on how to effectively translate research results from pharmacoepidemiology and comparative effectiveness research to informatics interventions that improve medication safety for older adults, especially nursing home residents. To accomplish this goal, he proposes eight career development activities and two research aims that will help him 1) obtain rigorous training in the science and practice of creating clinical decision support interventions that are effective in the nursing home setting; 2) obtain a thorough understanding of how falls and fall risk factors are detected, monitored, reported, and assessed in the nursing home setting; and 3) learn the perceptions of multiple nursing home clinician stakeholders on what research is needed to help reduce medication-related adverse events. The two research aims will enable him to integrate and apply the knowledge that he will gain through the proposed training activities by exploring the feasibility and potential clinical usefulness of actively monitoring patients exposed to psycho- tropic PDDIs. The approach would use electronic data available in most United States (US) NHs to provide highly specific and actionable alerts to physicians and/or nurses when a resident who is exposed to a PDDI involving a psychotropic drug transitions to a state of unacceptably high risk for experiencing a fall. Dr. Boyce's hypothesis is that this approach will extend the ability of NH clinicians to perform the recommended ""diligent monitoring"" of PDDIs, while avoiding alert fatigue. He anticipates that the approach would be generalizable to other prevalent NH ADEs (e.g., delirium) and other drug classes (e.g., mood stabilizers). This proposal is relevant to public health because it will explore an innovative approach to managing PDDIs that may ultimately re- duce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). It wil also inform an R-series grant proposal to study a mature intervention that Dr. Boyce plans to submit in year 2 of the project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will impact public health by providing quantitative and qualitative pilot data that will inform the design of an intervention that should ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). The work will also provide a solid research basis for future active monitoring interventios targeting a broader set of PDDIs and other adverse events (e.g., delirium) prevalent in the NH setting.",Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr,8634379,K01AG044433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Delirium', 'Detection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Group Interviews', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Solid', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Support', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness research', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'high risk', 'hypnotic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'professor', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'sedative', 'therapy design']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2014,114449,0.06574069160739081
"A New Paradigm for Hypertension in the Elderly- Beyond Age DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 60% of adults age ≥ 65 years have high blood pressure (BP), but optimal management of high BP in the elderly remains controversial. Contrary to evidence in middle age that lowering BP is clearly beneficial, data in older adults are inconsistent and high BP may not be a risk factor in all elders. We recently reported that, among participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey age e65 years, high BP was a risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) death only among persons in better health status (defined as fast walking of a 20-ft walk test). In contrast, high BP was not a risk factor among slow walkers. Additionally, the benefit of lowering BP in all elders remains an issue of debate; a recent meta-analysis in persons age 80 years and older reported no benefit of BP treatment on mortality, and significant heterogeneity across trials. Finally, there is growin concern for potential harms associated with treatment to lower BP. Excessive lowering of BP, particularly diastolic, has been associated with increased risk for death and cardiovascular events in some studies. In the proposed research, we propose a novel paradigm where the associations of BP with adverse outcomes in older persons are considered in the setting of the complex aging process. Our long-term goal is to reliably identify elderly persons in whom BP treatment is beneficial and those in whom treatment is ineffective or even harmful, by defining subpopulations of similar health status. Specifically, aim 1 proposes to elucidate factors from four domains (functional, cognitive/mental, self-rated health, and physiologic) that can identify elderly persons in whom high systolic BP is strongly associated with higher risk for death and CV events, and those in whom it is not, using data from three NIH-funded cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) and Sacramento Area Latino Study of Aging (SALSA). In aim 2, we will evaluate the role of diastolic BP across level of health status. Finally, based on findings from these observational cohorts, in aim 3 we will evaluate whether these factors can identify elderly persons in whom treatment to lower BP is of maximum benefit in two randomized controlled trials: the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly (SHEP) and the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3). Since participants in trials are healthier than the U.S. population, we will also evaluate the effect of treatment in the observational studies, using state-of-the-art causal inference methods, which can correct for the bias of standard analytic approaches. Completion of these aims will substantially advance our understanding of the importance of high BP in older adults; will improve our ability to identify elderly persons who will benefit from BP treatment; will allow a systematic understanding of groups in whom evidence for BP treatment is lacking; and will guide design of future trials of hypertension in elderly adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Treatment of high blood pressure in elderly persons remains controversial. This proposal focuses on developing systematic methods to understand which elderly persons benefit from lowering blood pressure.

"Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of elderly who cannot maintain functional independence in their own homes is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, gaps in our knowledge base concerning how to scale and validate activity recognition and health assessment technologies currently limit clinical translation of smart environments for real-time health monitoring and intervention. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this renewal application is to design, evaluate and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities, provide automated health assessment and support real-time interventions. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. We hypothesize that many older adults who require support completing everyday activities can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Building on our pioneering prior work and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) expand and validate software algorithms that recognize daily activities and provide automated functional assessment to encompass a greater number of behaviors and more diverse older adult population; (2) develop and validate software algorithms that provide automated health assessment by partnering actigraphy and ecological momentary assessment with in-home smart home data; (3) develop technologies to provide data-driven context-aware automated prompts; and (4) investigate methods for visualizing and integrating clinically-relevant smart home health data into personal and electronic health records. The proposed work is innovative because it partners real-time methodologies and defines methods of detecting and coping with aging and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. This work is significant because it provides the basis for technologies that will keep older adults with functional impairment in their homes and monitor frail older individuals from afar. The outcome of this work will result in automated health assessments that make use of smart technology, recommendations for improving the ecological validity of office-based clinical assessments, automated real-time intervention methods that can help support preventative health care measures, and clinically-relevant, user-friendly interfaces for integration of smart home data into health records.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smar home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to gather validated activity and health related information that can be used by the medical community to improve the efficacy of traditional assessment and support ecological momentary intervention techniques. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.                ",Smart Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance,8794633,R01EB009675,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Progress Reports', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Software Design', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'computer science', 'coping', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disability', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'health care delivery', 'health record', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social', 'technology development', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,334654,0.12163017822485271

"Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this research is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). Currently, more than 28 million Americans have impaired hearing and approximately 75% of these persons are over the age of 55. The prevalence of presbycusis will increase substantially with the aging of the population. To meet the challenges of this most common chronic condition of aging, improved diagnostic methods, treatment approaches, and prevention strategies will be of great importance. To meet these objectives, four research projects are proposed. Project 1 assesses age-related changes in human cochlear and neural function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies. Project 2 examines the impact of metabolic and sensory presbycusis and aging on brain structure and functional networks that support speech recognition. Project 3 identifies genetic variations causing an increased susceptibility to age-related hearing loss using DNA samples from older adults in our study and defines their pathological consequences in human temporal bones. Project 4 studies adult stem cell dependency on the cochlear extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment using animal models of metabolic presbycusis and ECM deficiency, and observations of cochlear tissues from human temporal bones. A central goal is to relate changes observed in animal models of metabolic presbycusis to declines in hearing in older humans. In parallel with this goal, results from the large battery of tests obtained from participants in our longitudinal study (Human Subjects Core) will be analyzed to further define and validate phenotypes of age-related hearing loss. Thus, four interrelated research projects, supported by large numbers of well-characterized human subjects and a detailed database of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, form a cohesive program that addresses fundamental questions on human presbycusis. The Clinical Research Center is unique in several respects, including its 25-year longitudinal study of  hearing in older persons, the diversity of basic, translational, and clinical approaches, and its focus on a disorder that contributes to poor communication abilities and reduced quality of life for millions of older adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Clinical Research Center leverages the multidisciplinary and wide-ranging expertise in each project, and the wealth of information available in the human subject database, to generate new knowledge on the high prevalence public health problem of age-related hearing loss. Our goals are to reduce its prevalence, slow its progression, and develop new prevention, diagnostic, and treatments strategies to improve communication and quality of life of older adults.      Subproject 1  Defining Phenotypes of Age-Related Hearing Loss  Lead Investigator: Judy R. Dubno, Ph.D.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complex genetic and environmental factors affecting human hearing over the lifespan contribute to a large variation in audiometric profiles and suprathreshold measures of auditory function. As a result, determining mechanisms of age-related hearing loss in older adults is challenging because genetic, age, noise history, injury, disease, medication, diet, and other factors can work independently and jointly to alter human auditory function. Although morphologic findings from older humans are limited to postmortem data, experimental procedures with animals of known heredity can disrupt specific cochlear systems, model certain pathologic conditions, and introduce or minimize environmental exposures, while measuring subsequent changes in auditory function. Consistent with results from animal models linking audiometric profiles to specific cochlear pathologies, such as metabolic or sensory loss, audiograms from the Clinical Research Center's human subject database (Core B) were classified into four audiometric phenotypes, which provided a means to characterize the pathophysiology of hearing loss in older humans. Audiometric phenotypes determined using supervised machine learning classifiers were consistent with expected demographic and noise history patterns that segregate with patterns of hearing loss. Project 1 will refine and further validate these phenotyping methods using suprathreshold measures of cochlear and neural function beyond the audiogram that characterize metabolic and sensory presbyacusis, and the additive effects of morphologic and functional neural loss. To meet this goal Aim 1.1 tests the hypothesis that older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis differ in cochlear nonlinearities and lower frequency suprathreshold auditory function. Aim 1.2 tests the hypothesis that changes in auditory nerve activity result in unique and additive effects in older adults with metabolic and sensory presbyacusis. Thus, Project 1 will assess age- related changes in auditory function related to metabolic, sensory, and neural pathologies and link findings to Project 2, focused on central auditory and cortical changes, and to translational Projects 3 and 4, which will determine the genetic and cellular mechanisms of age-related hearing loss using humans and human tissue. With these approaches, morphologic and physiologic changes characterizing metabolic, sensory, and neural presbyacusis provide a framework for assessing and interpreting age-related changes in human auditory function.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the variations in pathophysiology underlying human age-related hearing loss may dictate different diagnostic test batteries, hearing-aid fitting  algorithms, auditory-training regimens, and recommendations for communication strategies. This new information will lead to better diagnosis and treatments for this high-prevalence public health concern, and improved communication and quality of life for millions of older adults.",Experimental and Clinical Studies of Presbycusis,8617361,P50DC000422,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Audiometry', 'Auditory', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heredity', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Presbycusis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Structure', 'Temporal bone structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'age related', 'hearing impairment', 'human subject', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'speech recognition', 'treatment strategy']",NIDCD,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,P50,2014,2047726,0.08266191011553725
"Smart Environment Technologies for Health Assessment and Assistance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of Americans unable to live independently in their homes due to cognitive or physical impairments is rising significantly due to the aging of the population. There is a currently a fundamental gap in the knowledge base concerning how to apply machine learning technologies to improve health monitoring and how to harness these technologies to implement interventions designed to sustain independent living. The long-term objective of this work is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this particular application is to design, implement, and evaluate technologies for assessing everyday functional limitations and for providing automated intervention strategies for persons with early-stage dementia. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. The central hypothesis is that many older adults with cognitive impairment can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Guided by strong preliminary data and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Design software algorithms that use smart environment data to recognize complex everyday activities in real-world settings, (2) Use smart environments to automate functional health assessment and to examine the ecological validity of laboratory-based measures, (3) Design automated reminder and prompting-based interventions to aid with everyday activity completion, and (4) Analyze correlations between everyday behavioral patterns and physiological data. The proposed work is innovative because it defines methods of detecting and coping with aging, early dementia and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. The proposed work is significant because it provides the basis for automated, robust functional assessment of individuals with cognitive limitations and of intervention strategies designed to improve functional independence for these individuals. Rather than relying on self-reporting by the patient or by an informant who may or may not spend extended time with the patient, smart home technologies will allow us to identify functional deficits that impede a patient's ability to maintain independence in their home as they begin to occur, and to extend independent living at home by intervening in a real world setting.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed studies represent the first application of smart environment and machine learning technologies to the problem of in-home functional performance assessment. The result of this research will be software algorithms embedded in everyday environments that provide more reliable and accessible tools for measuring functional limitations, and that lay the foundation for creating and assessing tools that sustain or improve the ability to accomplish everyday tasks of living. Once such technologies become available, there is the likelihood that they can provide an ecologically valid method for monitoring an individual's everyday functional status and for extending the amount of time individuals can live independently in their own homes through the use of automated and reminder-based intervention.

"Chronic Conditions and Mutuality of Care in Late Life Marriage     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% experience functional disability. Thus, married older adults are not only likely to cope with chronic conditios and disability of their own but also their spouse's. Understanding how support dynamics in marriage influence each partner's health will provide great insight into helping couples stay healthier and functionally independent into late life. The aim of the proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (MRSDA) is to train the candidate in epidemiology of aging and advanced dyadic data analysis techniques to build on her expertise in experimental research and to understand how mutual care in late-life marriage influence health, particularly cardiovascular health and depression, and longevity. The proposed research focuses on older couples in which both partners suffer from chronic conditions and disability, and drawing from communal relationships theory, mutual care is defined as both partners receiving high levels of balanced instrumental and emotional support from one another. Through this MRSDA, the candidate will (1) learn from expert mentors and consultants about the epidemiology of aging and advanced statistical techniques to analyze dyadic, longitudinal data, (2) conduct secondary analysis on a large epidemiologic dyadic data set to examine how mutual care in older adult marriages influences long-term health and longevity and an experiment to examine a proposed mechanism, cardiovascular stress recovery, (3) complete coursework in epidemiology of aging, advanced epidemiologic statistics, and research ethics, and (4) attend workshops on dyadic data analysis. Yale University is a phenomenal environment to pursue this training as it has extensive resources in epidemiology of aging, statistics for analyzing epidemiologic data, experimental relationships research, and cardiovascular psychophysiology. The candidate has a state-of-the- art observational and psychophysiology lab that she will utilize for this project. Th Yale School of Public Health and the Claude D. Pepper Older American's Independence Center at Yale have excellent junior faculty mentoring programs. The candidate's primary mentor, Dr. Becca Levy at Yale School of Public Health has extensive expertise in bridging experimental and epidemiological methods to study psychosocial factors and health in older adults, including dyads. Dr. Richard Schulz will serve as a co-mentor, as he is the primary investigator for the Cardiovascular Health Effects Study which will be used for Study 1 of the proposed research and is an expert in conducting large, longitudinal studies. Dr. Trace Kershaw, an expert in dyadic data analysis at Yale School of Public Health, will also be a co-mentor. The proposed training will occur in the context of (1) a longitudinal study of married couples in which both members of the couple have chronic conditions and disability (Study 1; The Caregiver Health Effects Study; n=819 couples; an ancillary study to the Cardiovascular Health Study) examining the influence of mutual support on health trajectories (e.g. clinical and subclinical indicators of cardiovascular disease, clinical depression, and self-reported health) and longevity, and (2) an experimental study (Study 2; n=100 couples) examining cardiovascular stress recovery, a proposed mechanism for the link between mutual care and cardiovascular health proposed in Study 1. In the experimental study each partner will discuss a health-related stressor, and mutual support will be manipulated and compared to a control and one-sided support conditions to examine the effects on cardiovascular stress recovery. Consistent with the priorities outlined by the National Institute on Aging, the proposed MRSDA has the potential to address mechanisms for links between interpersonal relationships and health in the context of aging (RFA: PA-11-128). Further, the combination of training and research will serve as a spring board for the candidate's independent research career to elucidate how interpersonal relationships influence health among older adults.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance It is estimated that 88% of all older adults have at least one chronic condition, 69% have more than one chronic condition, and 33% are functionally disabled.

"Variable prompting technology for improving the ADL task performance of older adu    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The older adult population (65+) is the fastest growing segment of the American population and is expected to grow from 12% to 21% of the US population over the next 20 years 1. As people live longer, the prevalence of debilitating, diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia will also increase. The cognitive decline associated with dementia often leads to impaired functioning with activities of daily living (ADL) with a resultant increased burden for health and social support services currently approaches $100 billion annually in the United States.1 Attempts to minimize the demand for human support services have resulted in research investigating the use of assistive technology to support independence. These systems generally incorporate sensors and/or video surveillance techniques to remotely monitor the health and behavior of seniors. However, this population is still underserved by existing technology's ability to detect the required amount of prompting needed and provide coaching on activities of daily living in a respectful, non-invasive manner. Consistent with NIA's mission and research priorities, CreateAbility Concepts, Inc.'s (CCI) will produce the SMART (Sensor Monitoring and Acuity Recognition Technology) prompt system. The hypothesis for Phase I is that variable prompting technology can successfully aid in the completion of tasks associated with ADLs for individuals with cognitive impairments. The Specific Aims CCI will use to test this hypothesis are: 1): Design and develop the computer vision and integrate and test the prototype subsystems to support the pilot study, and 2) Using a pilot study, determine whether variable prompting will improve the functional task performance for older adults with dementia. At the conclusion of Phase I, CCI will have data from a pilot study with 60 participants to support the premise that older adults with dementia can independently complete tasks of varying complexities when a human administrator assesses their need based on the participant's task performance and supplies the correct level of detail to the participant. Market acceptance is expected to be high due to the pent up demand and cost- effective offering.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this SBIR project, CreateAbility Concepts, Inc. will develop technology to support and improve quality of life, well-being, and the ability of older adults to live independently and safely at home.

There is a currently a fundamental gap in the knowledge base concerning how to apply machine learning technologies to improve health monitoring and how to harness these technologies to implement interventions designed to sustain independent living. The long-term objective of this work is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The objective of this particular application is to design, implement, and evaluate technologies for assessing everyday functional limitations and for providing automated intervention strategies for persons with early-stage dementia. To most people home is a sanctuary, yet today those who need special care, predominantly older adults, must leave home to meet clinical needs. The central hypothesis is that many older adults with cognitive impairment can lead independent lives in their own homes with the aid of automated assistance and health monitoring. The rational for the proposed work is that smart environment technologies can improve quality of life and health care for older adults who require assistance with everyday functional activities and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Guided by strong preliminary data and a partnership between computer science and clinical neuropsychology researchers, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Design software algorithms that use smart environment data to recognize complex everyday activities in real-world settings, (2) Use smart environments to automate functional health assessment and to examine the ecological validity of laboratory-based measures, (3) Design automated reminder and prompting-based interventions to aid with everyday activity completion, and (4) Analyze correlations between everyday behavioral patterns and physiological data. The proposed work is innovative because it defines methods of detecting and coping with aging, early dementia and disabilities in our most personal environments: our homes. The proposed work is significant because it provides the basis for automated, robust functional assessment of individuals with cognitive limitations and of intervention strategies designed to improve functional independence for these individuals. Rather than relying on self-reporting by the patient or by an informant who may or may not spend extended time with the patient, smart home technologies will allow us to identify functional deficits that impede a patient's ability to maintain independence in their home as they begin to occur, and to extend independent living at home by intervening in a real world setting.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed studies represent the first application of smart environment and machine learning technologies to the problem of in-home functional performance assessment. The result of this research will be software algorithms embedded in everyday environments that provide more reliable and accessible tools for measuring functional limitations, and that lay the foundation for creating and assessing tools that sustain or improve the ability to accomplish everyday tasks of living. Once such technologies become available, there is the likelihood that they can provide an ecologically valid method for monitoring an individual's everyday functional status and for extending the amount of time individuals can live independently in their own homes through the use of automated and reminder-based intervention.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed studies represent the first application of smart environment and machine learning technologies to the problem of in-home functional performance assessment.

"Cognitive and social aspects of decision-making  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of decision making in older adults is critical for both theoretical and practical reasons. Despite the importance of this topic, there is limited empirical data describing how decision making changes in adulthood. The proposed project will examine the basic processes that underlie decision-making in older adults. A review of the literature suggests that older adults should rely more on heuristics and be more susceptible to environmental triggers than younger adults. However, a direct examination of the impact on decision-making has not been done. Specifically, we will examine the availability and anchoring heuristics in younger and older adults using modified versions of the traditional tasks designed by Tversky and Kahneman (1973, 1974). Finally, we will examine the impact of a negative stereotype trigger on the use of heuristics in older and younger adults. A total of 6 experiments are proposed over a three-year period. Experiment 1 examines the availability heuristic in young and older adults across several conditions that manipulate the amount of material presented. Experiment 2 examines the availability heuristic in older and young adults across two conditions that manipulate speed of presentation. It is hypothesized that older adults will demonstrate an increase in the availability heuristic on conditions with a large amount of material and with speeded presentation. Experiment 3 and 4 will examine the anchoring bias in two experiments that present an anchor randomly and with a decision agent present, respectively. We hypothesize an increase in the anchoring bias and more reliance on decision agents. Experiment 5 and 6 will introduce a negative stereotype trigger prior to the administration of an availability heuristic task and anchoring task. We hypothesize that the addition of a trigger will result in an increased bias across tasks and conditions as older adults switch from an analytic to rule-based mode.   n/a",Cognitive and social aspects of decision-making,6556001,R15AG021442,"['age difference', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' bias', ' clinical research', ' cognition', ' decision making', ' human old age (65+)', ' human subject', ' prejudice', ' questionnaires', ' university student', ' young adult human (21-34)']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT COLORADO SPGS,R15,2002,137500,0.17267831643480205
"SCH: INT: VOLI: Voice Assistant for Quality of Life and Healthcare Improvement in Aging Populations   According to the latest US Census Bureau predictions, by 2035 older people are projected to outnumber children for the first time in US history. This brings significant societal challenges based on their unique living and health-related conditions stemming from reduced sensory, motor, and cognitive capabilities, as wen as multiple chronic conditions. We propose a personalized and context-aware voice-based digital assistant to improve the quality of life and the healthcare of older adults. VOLI will leverage the growing capabilities of existing technologies, such as mobile devices and smart speakers, and go well beyond the basics of weather reports, news services, and simple games, to provide more complex voice-based services and to focus on the healthcare domain with its many challenges and constraints. We will pursue three parallel research aims: 1) Our technical aim will investigate how digital assistants, natural language processing, and machine learning can produce meaningful health-related conversations by leveraging population- and patient-level data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs); 2) Our social, behavioral, and cognitive aim will focus on designing services for older adults based on their needs to support independence and investigate the acceptability of digital assistants for the aging population; and 3) Our clinical aim will investigate how digital assistants can detect new symptoms and correlate them with medication side effects and interactions, worsening of existing conditions, or onset of new illnesses. Using our VOLI voice-assistant, older adults will be able to get medication reminders and instructions based on prescriptions and clinical notes from EHRs, notify their family/caregiver about their well-being status, interact with their healthcare provider, request an Uber/Lyft car or other third-party services, engage in cognitive games, report symptoms as they occur throughout the day and over the counter medications they are taking, ask questions about symptoms and medications, and so on. VOLi integrates information from EHRs, clinical ontologies, and patient-level terminology. This work will be supported by innovations in natural language understanding, deep learning, and human-computer interfaces. Our work is guided by both clinicians and researchers in human-centered computing. Our team has a history of successful interdisciplinary work in healthcare, expert systems in clinical care, EHR integration, patient monitoring and self-report, ubiquitous computing, data analytics, and field studies. This research directly supports the mission of NIA by addressing the needs of older adults to be independent in their homes and to optimize their healthcare based on the context of their symptoms and medications. VOLI will also reduce caregiving burden and optimize the interactions with healthcare and service providers. The research can be extended to monitor recovery after surgery and reduce length of stay in the hospital, identify onset of new illness, or Identify when to refer a patient to hospice.",SCH: INT: VOLI: Voice Assistant for Quality of Life and Healthcare Improvement in Aging Populations  ,10019457,R56AG067393,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data Analytics', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Expert Systems', 'Family Caregiver', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Instruction', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Time', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Voice', 'Weather', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'care giving burden', 'clinical care', 'deep learning', 'design', 'electronic data', 'field study', 'handheld mobile device', 'hospice environment', 'human centered computing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent personal assistant', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'news', 'postoperative recovery', 'service providers', 'side effect', 'social', 'stem', 'ubiquitous computing']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R56,2020,299370,0.08454665403510318
"Are phenotype algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults?- Revision Are phenotyping algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults? According to the latest population estimates by the US Census bureau, the United States population is growing older and more diverse, with their projections indicating that in 2035 there will be more people 65-and-older than 18-and-younger. In terms of diversity, the US Census Bureau projects that by 2060 the non-Hispanic White-alone population will shrink by 20 million, leading to the increased representation of currently underrepresented minority groups. These future population milestones paired with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) use in medicine, present a very unique and problematic problem: determining if AI solutions are fair for underrepresented populations within older adults. This has been a very debated issue, with opinion pieces in the New York times making it clear that when done incorrectly, AI solutions can actually worsen health disparities in underrepresented populations due to the nature of the training sets for said AI solutions. It is intuitive to understand how dermatology AI systems could be biased to perform better for lighter skinned individuals, due to the prevalence of said patients in the training datasets. Other biases come from the fact that there is simply a lack of diverse research subjects, which is why their mortality outcomes are considerably worse. Electronic phenotyping algorithms are the cornerstone for automatic identification of selected patient groups for tasks like disease classification, epidemiological studies and clinical-trial recruitment. These algorithms are both rule-based or probabilistic in nature (machine learning models), and are usually built by using bundled patient populations (everybody put together), with very few exceptions (due to the nature of the phenotype) having some sort of stratification of populations. This proposed project seeks to identify bias in probabilistic electronic phenotype algorithms for older populations and create best-practices and software tools to overcome them in order to lead to better health outcomes. Are phenotyping algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults? We will determine racial and age bias in probabilistic phenotype algorithms in both local, and national datasets. After characterizing bias, we will develop best-practices and software tools to improve the phenotyping process to achieve fairness for underrepresented minorities.",Are phenotype algorithms fair for underrepresented minorities within older adults?- Revision,10049865,P30AG059307,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Censuses', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data Set', 'Dermatology', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Excision', 'Expert Systems', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'New York', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Research Subjects', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Software Tools', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States', 'base', 'disease classification', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic bias', 'ethnic diversity', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'population stratification', 'racial bias', 'recruit']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,P30,2020,50916,0.09554869582829638
"PRECEDE: PREsurgical Cognitive Evaluation via Digital clockfacEdrawing ABSTRACT Preoperative cognitive impairment is common among older adults preparing for surgery. Despite growing evidence that preoperative cognitive/neuronal integrity is a risk factor for perioperative insults and post- operative adverse outcomes, health care systems do not systematically pre-operatively screen for cognition. Clinical researchers have yet to identify a pragmatic approach to pre-operative cognitive screening. Our team members have developed the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), a tool that captures subtle behavioral variables during a rapid (5-minute) clock drawing assessment. The data and benefit afforded by this tool have yet to be considered across perioperative contexts. We will apply the dCDT within a large number of pre- surgical patients (n=5,000 per year) coupled with novel machine learning algorithms to address three specific aims. Aim 1: examine range and distribution of preoperative neurocognitive impairment with older adult preoperative patients relative to non-surgical older adult demographically matched peers (available n=2,400 via NIH/Boston University Framingham Heart Study) using novel previously unobserved dCDT graphomotor and decision making variables; Aim 2: examine the predictive validity of presurgical dCDT variables on postoperative, clinician reported/hospital recorded events; Aim 3: examine pre to postoperative 6-week, 3- month, and 1-year change in dCDT and NIH PROMIS metrics for thoracic (n=70), orthopedic (n=70), major abdominal-pelvic patients (n=70), and non-surgery peers (n=70). For the observational studies (Aim 1 and 2), individuals > 65 years presenting to the UFHealth presurgical clinic will complete the dCDT as well as a three- word memory test and frailty assessment as part of the standard clinical evaluation. Surgical and anesthetic details will be acquired via the electronic medical record. Clinically-relevant outcomes will include complications, length of stay, cost of care, functional capacity, and mortality. Outcomes will be supplemented by a separate longitudinally-studied subgroup (Aim 3) completing NIH PROMIS metrics at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 1year after surgery. Analyses will focus on stratifying distributions and clusters of dCDT characteristics across numerous sociodemographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors. The predictive value of the dCDT will be modeled relative to clinical outcomes. Changes in dCDT and baseline NIH PROMIS domains will be compared pre- and post-operatively and examined for interactions with longitudinal perioperative events. Subaims: We will apply `deep learning' approaches to drawings to identify novel features of pre-surgical patients relative to a large sample of demographically equated dCDT data points available through the Framingham Heart Study. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)-based machine learning approaches will characterize interactions between preoperative dCDT features and intraoperative anesthetic sensitivities.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Assessing cognition prior to surgery has relevance for a number of reasons, but has yet to be applied due to pragmatic issues associated with assessment complexities and time. Here, we will leverage a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool (the Clock Drawing Test) to examine 1) pre-operative cognitive abilities in adults > 65 years attending a tertiary academic medical hospital pre-operative clinic; 2) how pre-operative cognitive abilities predict post-operative hospital/clinical reported outcomes (i.e., length of stay, hospital cost) and 3) how pre-operative cognitive abilities interact with perioperative events to predict post-operative cognitive change and patient reported outcomes.

"Understanding and Predicting High-Need, High-Cost Patients among Older Adults PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This is a K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award submitted to the National Institute on Aging by Yongkang Zhang, a Research Associate in the Department of Healthcare Policy and Research at Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC). Dr. Zhang’s career goal is to become an independent researcher on improving care for the elderly through developing and applying effective prediction tools to identify older adults with complex conditions and high healthcare needs. This K99/R00 application will provide Dr. Zhang with the necessary training 1) to understand the complexity and characteristics of high-need, high-cost (HNHC) older adults; 2) to develop a prediction model for HNHC adults using machine learning methods; and 3) to test the performance of the machine learning-based model with three commonly used, patient-risk prediction tools.  Dr. Zhang has assembled a mentor team of accomplished researchers across multiple divisions and departments at Weill Cornell Medical College: Dr. Rainu Kaushal (primary mentor) who is the Nanette Laitman Distinguished Professor and an expert on the HNHC patients and health data science; Dr. Lawrence Casalino (co-mentor) who is the Livingston Farrand Professor of Public Health and an expert on characteristics of and healthcare delivery for HNHC patients; Dr. Mark Lachs (co-mentor) who is a Professor of Geriatrics and prac- ticing geriatrician and an expert on the complexity and healthcare needs of older adults; Dr. Yuhua Bao (co- mentor) who is an Associate Professor of Healthcare Policy and Research and expert on behavioral health conditions and prescription data; Dr. Fei Wang (co-mentor) who is an Associate Professor of Health Informat- ics and an expert on machine learning methods; and Dr. James Flory (consultant) who is an Assistant Profes- sor of Healthcare Policy and Research and practicing clinician and an expert on medication use.  HNHC older adults are small group of patients representing a disproportionate share of healthcare utili- zation. These patients are more likely to experience preventable quality and safety problems due to their fre- quent interactions with health systems. Caring for HNHC older adults provides great potential benefits for qual- ity improvement and cost reduction. However, the benefits are unlikely to be realized unless these patients can be correctly identified and targeted. Building on his previous research and training on developing a claims data-based taxonomy for HNHC Medicare patients, Dr. Zhang’s research will understand the characteristics of HNHC older adults and develop predictors for these patients using clinical and prescription data (Aim 1), de- velop a machine learning-based prediction model for HNHC older adults (Aim 2), and compare the perfor- mance of the prediction model with three commonly used, patient risk prediction tools (Aim 3). This research will be the foundation for an R01 grant application that will incorporate this prediction model into healthcare de- livery process and identify the optimal ways to inform opportunities for improvement in healthcare delivery. PROJECT NARRATIVE High-need, high-cost (HNHC) older adults are a small group of individuals representing a disproportionate share of healthcare utilization and experiencing preventable quality and safety problems. Improving care for HNHC older adults is challenging because of their complex medical, behavioral, and social conditions and the instability of their healthcare utilization. Developing a prediction model for HNHC older adults could better inform patient-centered clinical decision-making, help target quality improvement interventions, and prioritize the allocation of scarce healthcare resources.","Understanding and Predicting High-Need, High-Cost Patients among Older Adults",9977380,K99AG064030,"['Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elderly', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Policy Research', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Conditions', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'career', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'distinguished professor', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'frailty', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'health care service organization', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'mid-career faculty', 'multilayer perceptron', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'performance tests', 'post-doctoral training', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'random forest', 'social', 'social vulnerability', 'tool']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K99,2020,125185,0.15455402031407395
"Innovative technologies for active surveillance of older adults with low-risk skin cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the number one cancer diagnosed in the US each year and accounts for more cases than all other cancers combined.1,2 Most BCCs are not dangerous, as they typically grow slowly and rarely metastasize or affect quality of life. Because cumulative exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun is a major cause of these lesions, BCCs are considered a non-lethal disease of aging, with the vast majority occurring in people 65 years or older. Despite the low risk BCCs present to patients, in the US all lesions are usually treated. Though existing treatments are effective,3,4 post treatment complications are common; in one prospective cohort study 27% of patients reported a problem after a procedure.5 Moreover, over 100,000 BCCs are treated annually in persons who ultimately die within one year of unrelated causes.6 For patients near the end of life, who often manage multiple health issues, treating these lesions may expose them to the associated medical risks with little potential benefit.7  There is a pressing need to reduce over-treatment and instead develop safe and effective active surveillance methods for low risk BCC in older patients. This research aims to fundamentally change the current “one size fits all” standard of care for treatment of BCCs, which is particularly problematic for older adults.6,8,9 The goal of this application is to develop a mobile app for safe, home-based active surveillance of low risk basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). We hypothesize that home-based active surveillance of low risk BCCs would reduce unnecessary procedures, complications and burdensome clinic visits in patients whose BCCs are not changing, while ensuring that patients whose BCCs grow or become symptomatic receive prompt care. For the first step of the proposed research, we will refine an existing artificial intelligence algorithm and mobile app to optimize it for at-home active surveillence use for older adults with low-risk BCC. We will then conduct pre-testing with a small group of patients and caregivers (n=15) to iteratively improve the app and ensure usability. Finally, we will compare the data collected via the app to that collected during routine clinical visits. Over a 9-month period, we will follow participants (n=30) with low-risk BCC who have selected an active surveillance option. We will collect data monthly through the app, and every 3 months through in-person clinic visits. We will evaluate patient satisfaction and clinical course to determine the feasibility of using a mobile app for active surveillance of low-risk BCC.

"electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS). ABSTRACT Recent meta-analyses have found that participation in the appropriate fall-prevention exercise program for an older adult reduces the risk of falls by 23% in relative terms, for an absolute reduction of 0.20 falls per person per year. Many guidelines, including the US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF), recommend that older adults at risk of falls are referred to appropriate fall-prevention exercise programs (USPSTF Level B). Despite this evidence, many older adults do not receive appropriate referrals and support for fall-prevention exercises, with one study finding that less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). Older people living in rural areas are more likely to fall but are less likely to participate in fall prevention programs. Advances in computing technology can help to identify older people at risk of falls and disseminate guidance about the most effective interventions using clinical decision support (CDS) systems. Patients can be supported in their exercise programs through a patient-focused App distributed through the PCP or through content on their patient portal. Well-implemented CDS that is integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) can support prescribing or recommending effective strategies and engaging patients in fall prevention decision-making thus integrating evidence-based guidelines into clinical practice. The long-term goal of our research program is to enhance the safety of community-based older adults by reducing falls through an effective patient-centered learning health system called eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS). With eSTEPS, an exercise algorithm will be integrated into the EHR which will trigger a Best Practice Alert (BPA) and Smart Set to provide actionable CDS within primary care clinic workflows and facilitate the use of CDS with patients to ensure evidence-based recommendations are tailored to patient preferences. The resulting fall prevention exercise care plan will be sent to the EHR as a note and to a patient-facing App for the patient to view after their visit. In this proposal we will use traditional fall risk screening and machine learning approaches to accurately identify older adults at risk for falls. We will then develop, CDS implemented into the electronic health record that helps primary care providers and older patients develop a tailored fall prevention exercise plan. We will conduct a cluster randomized control trial in urban and rural primary care clinics to test the efficacy of the eSTEPS CDS intervention. Development of the eSTEPS CDS within the widely adopted Epic EHR will support dissemination of evidence for older adults, with a focus on rural elders. NARRATIVE There is substantial evidence that conducting multifactorial fall risk assessments and developing personalized prevention plans in primary care settings can reduce falls, but many barriers exist to integrating this evidence into practice. The US Preventive Service Task Force recommends fall prevention exercises for community- dwelling adults who are at increased risk for falls, however less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care providers (PCPs). The goal of this project is to develop, test, and evaluate shareable, standards-based fall prevention clinical decision support, eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS) that can used by primary care providers to facilitate personalized activity and exercise prescriptions and reduce falls in at risk older adults.",electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to Prevent FallS (eSTEPS).,10049339,R61AG068926,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Fall prevention', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Monitor', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Prevention Guidelines', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Screening procedure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Visit', 'base', 'behavior change', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'effective intervention', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'exercise prescription', 'exercise program', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'machine learning method', 'neighborhood safety', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'patient portal', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'rural area', 'screening', 'smartphone Application', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R61,2020,250020,0.08129398040283974
"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with chronic health conditions is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The long-term objective of this project is to improve human health and impact health care delivery by developing smart environments that aid with health monitoring and intervention. The primary objective of this application is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smart phones, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to perform health assessment and detection of health events (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to support sustainable improvement of brain health (Aim 3). Finally, we train machine learning algorithms from the clinical observations to automate assessment of health and intervention impact (Aim 4). The use of these technologies is expected to improve and extend the functional health and wellbeing of older adults, lead to more proactive and preventative health care, and reduce the caregiver burden of health monitoring and assistance. By understanding situational factors that impact prompt adherence, adherence situations can be increased. The approach is innovative because it will explore and validate new machine learning techniques for activity learning and health assessment based on clinical ground truth. These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home technology to automatically identify health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. The potential health care and social benefits of the proposed work are dramatic as this work will improve the clinical utility, usability and translation of smart home technologies for health assessment and intervention. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment.

"A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions: Supplement to focus on Alzheimer's and/or other dementias PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) is a challenge our society must address. While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The primary objective of the parent study is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. This supplement extends our design to monitor, assess, and intervene for individuals with ADRDs and their caregivers. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smartwatches, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to train algorithms for health assessment (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to extend brain health and objectively capture intervention both adherence and caregiver support (Aim 3). Clinician guidance is used to train machine learning algorithms to automatically recognize health events (Aim 4). Given the unique challenges that will arise when we include individuals with ADRDs, we also introduce novel methods to track multiple residents in smart environments (Aim 5) and compare behaviors between individuals with ADRDs and the original sample of older adults with chronic health conditions (Aim 6). These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society.

"Polypharmacy, Potentially Inappropriate Medications, and Adverse Outcomes in Older Adults with Advanced Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Polypharmacy (PP), or the concurrent use of multiple medications, affects up to 80% of older adults with cancer. It is associated with the use of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), which have risk greater than benefit in older adults. In older adults with cancer, PP/PIMs have been associated in some studies with adverse outcomes, including poor adherence to and tolerance of cancer therapy and decrease in physical functioning. However, these data have been inconsistent, and studies to date have examined specific populations (such as disease-specific subgroups enrolled in clinical trials) that may not be representative of the general population of older adults with cancer. This proposal presents a 2-year research and career development plan focused on examining a cohort (n=370) of older adults with advanced cancer receiving chemotherapy in community oncology clinics. This is a secondary analysis of the control arm of the Geriatric Assessment Intervention for Patients Aged 70 and Over Receiving Chemotherapy or Similar Agents for Advanced Cancer (“GAP”): Reducing Toxicity in Older Adults study (URCC 13059, principal investigator is primary mentor Dr. Mohile), describing prevalence and patterns of PP/PIMs as well as the relationship of PP/PIMs to adverse outcomes including relative dose intensity of chemotherapy (RDI, a ratio of received to standard doses of chemotherapy), chemotherapy toxicity, and functional trajectory. The candidate, Dr. Erika Ramsdale, is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Rochester and is board-certified in both Oncology and Geriatric Medicine. This proposal builds upon her prior systematic review of PP/PIMs in older patients with cancer, showing the limited data available in the literature, and her work demonstrating that PP/PIMs are associated with functional impairments in older adults with advanced cancer prior to initiating chemotherapy. The aims of the proposed study are: 1/to test the hypotheses that PP/PIMs rates will be higher than reported in most prior studies, and over-the-counter medications will comprise the majority of PIMs detected; 2/to examine the association of PP/PIMs and the following adverse outcomes in older adults with cancer starting chemotherapy: chemotherapy tolerability at 3 months (RDI, grade 3-5 chemotherapy toxicity), and functional decline over 3 months. An exploratory aim will also compare the performance of regression and other supervised classification methods to model and predict factors influencing chemotherapy toxicity, including PP/PIMs and functional status. The proposal describes a comprehensive mentorship and training plan to develop complementary skills and knowledge in in polypharmacy, quantitative analysis, and data science. Under the guidance of her primary mentor Dr. Supriya Mohile, co-mentors Dr. Holly Holmes and Dr. Martin Zand, and advisor Dr. Eva Culakova, she will advance her skills in these areas with the long-term goal of becoming an independent geriatric oncology researcher implementing and testing multi-level interventions to address polypharmacy in older adults with cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polypharmacy, or taking multiple concurrent medications, is very common in older adults with cancer receiving cancer treatment, and increases the risk of taking one or more medications which are “potentially inappropriate” based on having higher risk than benefit in older adults. Polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medications may be associated with adverse outcomes such as chemotherapy toxicity and functional decline in older adults with cancer. This proposal will examine the prevalence of polypharmacy, patterns of medication use, and impact of polypharmacy on tolerability of cancer treatment and functional trajectory in older patients with advanced cancer receiving chemotherapy.","Polypharmacy, Potentially Inappropriate Medications, and Adverse Outcomes in Older Adults with Advanced Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy",10027448,R03AG067977,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Antihistamines', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Pharmacists', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Companions', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Geriatric Assessment', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Holly', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical Function', 'Physical Performance', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Role', 'Series', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity due to chemotherapy', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'age related', 'aged', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'career development', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'i(19)', 'impaired functional status', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'interest', 'older patient', 'professor', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'research and development', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'symposium', 'systematic review']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R03,2020,154000,0.1437815562696804
"Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging Project Summary. Among older adults, sudden and unexpected financial losses as a result of fraud can have devastating consequences. A rapidly aging population, combined with age-related changes in decision-making processes, means that fraudulent activities targeting older adults is a growing public health problem that requires surveillance, education, and intervention. Motivated by theories of cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological aging, this proposal investigates behavioral and neural decision-making mechanisms associated with fraud risk in older adulthood. In a more globally connected and computerized world, older adults may constitute particular at-risk targets for highly effective forms of online financial fraud, such as through social engineering in the form of emails containing malicious links or attachments (phishing). Susceptibility to financial deception in aging has been investigated primarily in the context of age-related cognitive decline, while socioemotional and neurophysiological parameters have been largely understudied. Further, there are few effective approaches to characterize, monitor and detect, and eventually prevent, financial deception. The objectives of the proposed research are threefold: Aim 1 will determine financial deception risk across the adult life span. This aim will seek to confirm that age is associated with greater susceptibility to financial deception, online and in person. Aim 2 will characterize cognitive, socioemotional, and neurophysiological mechanisms associated with deception risk. Specifically, this aim will uncover the extent to which cognitive and socioemotional dysfunction, age-related dampening in neurophysiological reactivity, and structural and functional brain changes contribute to increased susceptibility in aging. Aim 3 involves the development and psychometric validation of a novel risk assessment interview and the development of an automated deception warning tool to alert older adults about potential online fraud. Our research design will span three data collection phases comprising healthy young, middle-aged, young-old, and old-old individuals. Leveraging infrastructure developed in our lab, a behavioral field experiment will determine real-life susceptibility to financial fraud via simulated phishing email attacks (Phase I). A comprehensive in-lab assessment of cognitive/socioemotional and neurophysiological mechanisms will follow (Phase II and III, respectively). A data-analytic Phase IV will integrate data collected across Phases I-III using statistical and machine-learning methods. This multidisciplinary approach, encompassing psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and engineering will lay the foundation for building an integrated approach to risk detection and the provision of financial decision-making supports in older adulthood. Findings and methodologies developed as part of this project have the potential to inform real-life decision-supportive interventions that adopt an age-targeted approach towards the long-term goal of financial risk reduction in older individuals. Project Narrative A rapidly aging population means that financial deception of the aged is an emerging public health problem that requires surveillance and intervention. An increasingly common form of financial fraud is conducted online as older adults more and more manage their assets online. The project goal is to determine cognitive, socioemotional, and neurobiological risk factors for financial deception in older adults and validate risk assessment and develop detection tools toward a long-term goal of identifying individuals who are particularly susceptible to financial fraud and facilitating prevention and decision-supportive intervention efforts.",Uncovering and Surveilling Financial Deception Risk in Aging,9970378,R01AG057764,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'American', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Deception', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Educational Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Mail', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Foundations', 'Fraud', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Structure', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Transact', 'Validation', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cyber security', 'decision-making capacity', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'financial decision making', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'phishing', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social factors', 'statistical and machine learning', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2020,322426,0.16381434974478587
"Individualized Vestibular Rehabilitation for Elderly with Self-Management and Gaming Elements Project Summary/Abstract: Vestibular rehabilitation has been proven to be effective in reducing dizziness and falls in older adults, but patient adherence is a major problem. Recent research shows that less than half of patients complete their rehabilitation. Some of the main reasons for this are the numerous visits that are required and accessibility. In particular for older individuals who experience dizziness and/or falls, it may be difficult to travel to attend rehabilitation sessions. Additionally, rehabilitation programs become expensive in terms of equipment and health professional’s time. Programs may also not be available to all who may benefit because of geographical limitations. Previous research has shown that remote monitoring and gaming elements have great potential to solve these issues, even in an older population. However, current solutions are generic and effectiveness can be inconsistent. The overall goal of this project is to develop a vestibular rehabilitation app to be used by older adults at home. The app will improve adherence through gaming, self-management, and remote monitoring. Patients will use low-cost sensors placed on their bodies (head and waist) to play the games on the app. This allows simultaneous monitoring of patient progress while performing the exercises. This data can be shared with a clinician via email or the cloud, allowing the patient to perform the rehabilitation at their home and the clinician to monitor how well the patients performed their exercises. The vestibular rehabilitation components are packaged in a phone and tablet app that is easy to navigate for older individuals and has a modular design that allows individualized rehabilitation. By improving patient engagement and enjoyment, rehabilitation adherence should be improved as well. Phase I demonstrated feasibility of this approach. In Phase II, games will be added to cover a full at-home rehabilitation session and improve usability of the app. In addition, machine learning algorithms will be developed to provide real-time feedback if exercises are performed incorrectly. This ensures patients will perform their exercises correctly when at home. As in Phase I, clinical collaborators will provide continued guidance and testing throughout development to ensure clinical relevance and promote adoption during commercialization. This project uses a novel approach in that it develops rehabilitation games specifically designed for vestibular rehabilitation through a mobile app tailored for an older population. Current gaming approaches for rehabilitation typically use existing or commercial games. The use of sensors for remote monitoring is also novel in this area and allows patients to perform rehabilitation at their home, while being monitored by a clinician. This project is therefore likely to have a high clinical impact. It will advance clinical practice, make vestibular rehabilitation more accessible to older individuals, and help adherence to programs. Successful implementation of this program will reduce falls and improve quality of life of for patients. Project Narrative: The overall goal of this project is to develop an app for older individuals that will improve accessibility of vestibular rehabilitation and that will improve compliance compared to current rehabilitation programs. The proposed effort uses a novel approach that combines low-cost inertial sensors and machine learning algorithms with mobile device technology to measure performance, provide real-time feedback, and present data in a comprehensible way to the clinician via email or the cloud, removing the patients’ need to travel for rehabilitation sessions. These features are packaged in an app that is appropriate for and appealing to older users to improve compliance, and uses novel gaming elements specifically developed for vestibular rehabilitation rather than repurposing existing commercial games designed for younger users and entertainment.",Individualized Vestibular Rehabilitation for Elderly with Self-Management and Gaming Elements,10011222,R44DC017408,"['Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dizziness', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Exercise', 'Eye', 'Fall prevention', 'Feedback', 'Florida', 'Focus Groups', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Health care facility', 'Home Care Services', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Kansas', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Older Population', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Physical therapy', 'Play', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Self Management', 'Software Design', 'Supervision', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'exercise rehabilitation', 'experience', 'falls', 'gaze', 'handheld mobile device', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'motion sensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient engagement', 'physical therapist', 'programs', 'prototype', 'rehabilitation science', 'remote sensor', 'sensor', 'usability', 'visual tracking', 'web portal']",NIDCD,CFD RESEARCH CORPORATION,R44,2020,680368,0.029648307748592537
"Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Older Americans rely on the emergency department (ED) for acute, unscheduled care. Unfortunately, many older adults experience poor outcomes after ED visits, suggesting that these encounters represent missed opportunities to identify high risk patients and intervene to improve the transition to outpatient care. In particular, significant falls among older adults are a serious and preventable problem. Unscheduled ED visits offer an opportunity to identify older adults at higher risk of falls than the general primary care population at a time when fall risk factors can be modified, and thus offer an ideal additional setting for fall screening beyond primary care. Such screening is advocated in the ED, but screening interventions often fail due to time constraints of providers in the emergency setting. As electronic health record (EHR) systems evolve, computerized decision support offers the potential to support fall screening with less provider burden. The objective of this proposal is to identify adults at high risk for future falls and improve their care both during their ED visit and after discharge. As a physician scientist, my goal is to lead an independent research program to improve transitions to outpatient care following ED visits for older adults. This 5-year proposal will advance these goals by providing the necessary support and training in implementation science as well as informatics-based interventions. I have a unique background in engineering, emergency medicine, and health services research and am well prepared to successfully complete the proposal. I will be aided by a team of expert mentors at an institution with substantial resources and an outstanding environment to conduct the research proposed and transition to an independent investigator with R01 support. The proposed aims are to: 1) Compare EHR-based data extraction to in-person screening of future outpatient fall risk, 2) Using data available in the EHR at the time of presentation, develop a predictive algorithm to risk- stratify ED patients for risk of significant falls in the next 6 months, and 3) Design and pilot a clinical decision support intervention to identify older adults at high risk of falls and improve their care both in the ED and after discharge. These aims will be accomplished by creating and analyzing a database linking the EHR and claims data, incorporating novel elements derived by natural language processing, by utilizing machine learning in addition to traditional statistical techniques, and by developing and piloting an intervention in one health system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal directly addresses the public health burden of the rising rates of significant falls in older adults which are the leading cause of traumatic mortality in the elderly. There is an unmet need to improve screening practices for a variety of conditions in the emergency department, where individuals are often at high risk for poor outcomes after discharge. The proposed work will utilize a novel approach based on the electronic health record to screen for future fall risk that can be expanded and adapted to other high-risk patients in future work.",Preventing Future Falls among Older Adults Presenting to the Emergency Department,10007879,K08HS024558,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K08,2020,156859,0.11217519482963846
"Improving patient and caregiver engagement through the application of data science methods to audio recorded clinic visits stored in personal health libraries PROJECT SUMMARY    Forty to eighty percent of clinic visit information is forgotten by patients immediately post visit, a significant  barrier to self-­management leading to poor health outcomes. Visit summaries can improve recall, yet patient  uptake is limited and clinicians report significant burden in creating summaries for laypeople. Patients are  beginning to audio record visits and clinics are now offering this service. When patients receive a clinic  recording, 71% listen and 68% share it with a caregiver, resulting in improved understanding and self-­ management. Yet, unstructured recordings are difficult to navigate. Personal health libraries (PHLs) may help  patients organize health information;; yet current PHLs do not facilitate clinic-­recordings. The objective of this  project is to develop a PHL that integrates clinic audio-­recordings (Audio-­PHL), using data science methods to  link medical terms from the recording to trustworthy patient resources, which can be retrieved, organized,  edited and shared by patients. The specific aims are: Aim 1 Identify health information seeking needs and  strategies of older adults with multimorbidity and caregivers;; Aim 2 Develop an Audio-­PHL using data science  methods to securely analyze clinic visit recordings and make this information accessible and understandable  for patients;; and Aim 3 Demonstrate the usability and use of an Audio-­PHL in older adults with multimorbidity  and caregivers. Applicants hypothesize: (1) The Audio-­PHL will surpass acceptable usability metrics in older  adults and caregivers and (2) natural language processing (NLP) methods developed for the Audio-­PHL will  accurately identify key visit information (e.g. medication) and connect it to credible patient resources. The  development of the Audio-­PHL follows a user centered design model. In Aim 1, the applicants will use  participatory design activities with 48 end-­users to inform Audio-­PHL design. In Aim 2, the Audio-­PHL will be  created in iterative cycles informed by findings from Aim 1. In Aim 3, extensive usability evaluation will be  conducted in human computer interaction (HCI) laboratory settings to ensure Audio-­PHL surpasses acceptable  usability metrics. Field testing of the Audio-­PHL will follow via a patient-­randomized pilot trial with older adults  with multimorbidity from primary care. Participants (N=70) will receive an Audio-­PHL (intervention) or PHL  (control) with no recordings. Usability metrics and satisfaction will be assessed at one-­month. Preliminary data  on the impact of an Audio-­PHL on patient ability to seek, find and use health information with high confidence,  patient activation and caregiver confidence will also be gathered. The research is innovative because it will  provide patients and caregivers secure access to a PHL based on clinic-­recordings that uses data science  methods to organize visit information and connect it to trusted resources. The results are expected to have a

benefits of clinic recordings through the novel application of data science methods, to improve health outcomes  for older adults with multimorbidity through greater knowledge and confidence in their ability to self-­manage.   PROJECT NARRATIVE    Between 40 – 80% of clinic visit information is forgotten immediately by patients, a significant impediment to  self-­management for older adults with multimorbidity that leads to poor health outcomes. The proposed

"A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults Abstract  People aged 65+ will represent 21% of the U.S. population and increase to about 80 million by 2040, and the oldest old (age 85+) will number ~ 14.1 million. Population aging presents both opportunities and challenges for our healthcare, the economy, and existing social support systems. Many older adults especially the oldest old, minorities and those of lower Socio-Economic status (SES) are particularly vulnerable to social isolation, poor diet, and decreased levels of physical activity each of which influence morbidity and mortality. Mobile-based, tablet-based, and in-home technologies provide an excellent opportunity for projecting behavior- change interventions and social support into the everyday life of older adults at great economies of scale. The objectives of this study are to examine the usability and efficacy, for diverse older adults, of a new tablet-based dynamic system: the Fittle Senior System (FSS) that will provide: (1) personalized behavior-change programs for improved diet and increased physical activity and (2) online social interaction and support from small teams pursuing similar goals. The system builds on two technology-based systems developed by the investigative team: (1) the computer-based PRISM system, designed for older populations to support social connectivity and well-being, and (2) the Fittle+ mobile platform designed to support positive health behavior change through integrated online social support and personalized coaching based on artificial intelligence (AI). The study will be conducted in two phases. During Phase 1 we will develop and pilot test the FSS with representative samples of older adults. Phase 2 will involve a two group randomized trial where participants will be randomized to the Fittle Senior System (FSS, an adaptive coaching and social support system using mobile technology) or to a paper-based psycho-educational (BPE) control condition following a baseline assessment. The duration of the intervention phase will involve an active 12-week intervention phase followed by a 12-week maintenance phase. We will recruit and randomize 180 community dwelling adults aged 65+ years, who live alone and are at risk for social isolation (90 per condition - 30 White Caucasians, 30 Black/African Americans and 30 Hispanic Americans). We will recruit males and females commensurate to the gender proportions represented in this age group and work to ensure that we have sufficient representation from the “oldest old” cohort. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3mths post active intervention and 3mths post maintenance (6mths following active intervention) on clinically significant measures of health and health behaviors and indices of social support. We will also gather information on potential moderating (e.g., ethnicity, age) and mediating variables (e.g., health self-efficacy), which will be examined using multilevel modeling techniques guided by current theories of behavior change and technology acceptance and use among older adults. Project Narrative This proposed project is addressing a critical public concern. The population is aging and chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are common among older adults especially ethnic minorities. This study will develop and evaluate a mobile technology-based intervention designed to support positive health behavior change among diverse older adults through integrated online social support, personalized coaching and goal setting.",A Personalized Health Behavior System to Promote Well-Being in Older Adults,9928376,R01AG053163,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caucasians', 'Chronic', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Industry', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Jordan', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Older Population', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Self Efficacy', 'Social Interaction', 'Social isolation', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Support System', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'active method', 'age group', 'aged', 'aging and technology', 'aging population', 'base', 'behavior change', 'clinically significant', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'dynamic system', 'education research', 'efficacy trial', 'ethnic minority population', 'family structure', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'low socioeconomic status', 'male', 'medical schools', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'nutrition', 'programs', 'psychoeducational', 'psychoeducational intervention', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social factors', 'statistics', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,736726,0.12250430798267131
"Multimorbidity and Treatment-Related Outcomes in Older Heart Failure Patients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF) is the most common reason for hospitalization in older adults. Over 85% of all patients hospitalized with HF are 65 years of age or older. Multimorbidity, typically defined as the presence of ≥2 chronic conditions, increases the risks of hospitalization and death in older HF patients, and greatly complicates the clinical management of HF. Caution is required in applying national clinical practice guidelines to the care of older adults with multimorbidity, as this could result in undesirable net effects and less than optimal outcomes including adverse interactions between drugs and various concomitant diseases. In response to PA-17-088 (Exploratory Analyses of Existing Cohorts, Data Sets, and Stored Biospecimens to Address Clinical Aging Research Questions, R01), we propose to leverage an existing HF cohort, including data for more than 100,000 patients with HF within the Cardiovascular Research Network between 2005-2012, with follow-up data up to 2017. We will extend our previous efforts by examining treatment patterns and the net benefits versus harms of selected therapies in older adults with HF and a wide spectrum of multimorbidity burden. We will further examine the benefits and adverse outcomes of various therapies focusing on particularly vulnerable subgroups of patients with HF afflicted by two prevalent conditions, anemia or diabetes. Our specific aims are: (1) to examine the effectiveness of selected medical therapies (renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system blockers, beta-blockers, diuretics, and aldosterone receptor blockers) on death, HF hospitalization, and all-cause hospitalizations in a large, community-based population of older adults with HF across a range of levels of multimorbidity burden and left ventricular ejection fraction; (2) to evaluate targeted adverse outcomes, including kidney dysfunction, hyperkalemia, sodium disturbances, bradycardia, and syncope associated with selected HF therapies in older adults with HF, stratified by multimorbidity burden and left ventricular ejection fraction status; and (3) to characterize the potential benefits and adverse outcomes associated with selected HF therapies in older adults with HF and two prevalent comorbidity dyads—HF- diabetes and HF-anemia—that are common and substantially increase the risks of death and morbidity. In addition, we will create novel, validated methods to identify adverse outcomes related to HF therapies from unstructured data in large electronic health record systems through natural language processing technology, along with employing state-of-the-art analytic approaches to evaluate treatment-related outcomes. In that our proposed investigation will take advantage of a large, geographically and demographically diverse cohort of adults with HF receiving care within community-based healthcare delivery systems, we anticipate our findings will be highly generalizable to the broad spectrum of older adults with HF managed in “real-world” practice settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The presence of multiple chronic conditions, or multimorbidity, in older adults with heart failure substantially increases the complexity of their care, and increases the risks of hospitalization and death. In our study, we will examine treatment patterns and the net benefits versus harms of selected therapies in patients with heart failure and multimorbidity.

"Sense4Safety: Supporting socially vulnerable older adults Abstract Falls and fall-related injuries are significant public health issues for adults 65 years of age and older. Over a third of older adults (OA) fall each year and 10-20% of falls result in serious injuries such as fractures and head trauma. The annual direct medical costs in the US as a result of falls are estimated to exceed $50 billion, and this estimate does not include the indirect costs of disability, dependence, and decreased quality of life. This project targets community dwelling OA with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are socially vulnerable. MCI is a leading risk factor for falls in OA. Approximately 15%-20% of OA have MCI, and over 60% of OA with MCI fall annually – two to three times the rate of those without cognitive impairment. Socially vulnerable OA living in low-resource neighborhoods with poor housing conditions have twice the risk of falling. We have developed an innovative technology-supported nursing-driven intervention called Sense4Safety to 1) identify escalating risk for falls real-time through in-home passive sensor monitoring (including depth and motion sensors); 2) employ machine learning to inform individualized alerts for fall risk; and 3) link `at risk' socially vulnerable older adults with a nurse tele-coach who will guide them in implementing evidence-based individualized plans to reduce fall-risk. The purpose of this study is to refine the Sense4Safety intervention based on extensive feedback by low income OA with MCI, their family members or trusted others and clinicians in order to ensure that the passive monitoring system to predict fall risk for OA with MCI can generate actionable and tailored information that can be used effectively by these stakeholder groups. Project Narrative The proposed research study aims to refine an innovative technology-supported nursing-driven intervention called Sense4Safety to 1) identify escalating risk for falls real-time through in-home passive sensor monitoring (including depth and motion sensors); 2) employ machine learning to inform individualized alerts for fall risk; and 3) link `at risk' socially vulnerable older adults with a nurse tele-coach who will guide them in implementing evidence-based individualized plans to reduce fall-risk.

"Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults Benzodiazepine (BZD) use in the U.S. is common and increases with age. In a recent analysis, 8.7% of adults aged 65-80 years were prescribed BZDs during one year, even though a robust set of studies have established their association with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults, including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents, impaired cognition, and pharmaceutical overdose. Patients and their providers are then reluctant to change use once started, which may account for why older adults experience the highest rates of long-term BZD use. Relatively little is known about the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with starting and continuing BZD prescribing to older adults, yet this is critical to develop effective selective and indicated prevention strategies. In Aim 1, we will describe the patient, provider, and community characteristics associated with BZD initiation and continuation using a national 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries (n=3.6 million) linked to provider data from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile and community characteristics from the Area Health Resources File (AHRF). We will extend our analysis with OptumInsight data (n=6.7 million) to gain additional insights among commercially insured adults aged 50-64 given increased substance use among the Baby Boom cohort. Those patients currently prescribed BZDs and most at risk for BZD misuse (e.g., overlapping BZD prescriptions from multiple providers) and BZD-related overdose should receive indicated prevention strategies to address this potentially harmful use. In Aim 2, among those prescribed BZD, we will determine specific risk factors associated with BZD misuse and BZD-related overdose; these data will be used to develop a misuse clinical prediction tool. Using BZD users 50+ years old identified in Medicare and Optum, we will determine characteristics of patients and their prescribed BZD (e.g., high potency) most associated with misuse and overdose. We will then use machine learning to create a simple clinical prediction tool that providers can use to identify older adults at risk for misuse in their practices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will conduct semi-structured interviews with providers and patients to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool for providers seeking to engage high-risk BZD use patients. This aim is critical to improve the impact of our findings since psychological dependence on BZD can make reducing use a difficult topic for physicians and patients to address. We will conduct interviews with providers and older adult primary care patients (n=15 each) to obtain feedback to package and script the use of the clinical prediction tool, which we will make publicly available by website. The impact of our work will be to: 1) provide a detailed, national portrait of the factors that contribute to BZD use and misuse; 2) determine the older adults most at risk for serious adverse events; and 3) develop and package a clinical prediction tool to help providers address BZD use in their high-risk patients. Millions of older adults in the US are prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD) every year despite extensive evidence of the associated harms. This proposal will provide a detailed, national portrait of the patient, prescriber, and community characteristics that determine who receives a prescription. In addition, we will determine which patients are at risk for overdose or prescription BZD misuse and develop a simple clinical prediction tool providers can use to identify these patients in practice.","Leveraging large-scale national data to understand, reduce, and prevent benzodiazepine-related harms among older adults",9879630,R01DA045705,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alprazolam', 'American', 'American Medical Association', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Baby Booms', 'Beer', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Elderly', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fracture', 'Geriatrics', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Impaired cognition', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Managed Care', 'Medicare', 'Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Portraits', 'Poverty', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychological Dependence', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'beneficiary', 'benzodiazepine misuse', 'care providers', 'clinical candidate', 'cohort', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indicated prevention', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'older patient', 'overdose risk', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'primary care setting', 'rural area', 'rural patients', 'selective prevention', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,454065,0.1464981257538209
"Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease Resubmission 1 R01 AG058687-01 PI: Adriana Seelye, Ph.D. Project Summary. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease and their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and to reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. Project Objectives. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to objectively assess high-level IADL functioning in a new way that will more effectively identify the earliest subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence. The specific aims for this research are: Aim 1 will establish the most robust remotely monitored IADL variables and combinations of variables to discriminate between MCI and intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC using cross-sectional analyses. Aim 2 will determine the discriminatory ability of the new remotely monitored IADL variables compared to available IADL questionnaires to differentiate those with MCI relative to those with intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC in cross-sectional analyses. Aim 3 will identify and characterize the longitudinal trajectories (slopes) of remotely monitored IADL functioning over time between those with intact cognition and those with MCI using generalized linear mixed effects models, with person-specific IADL distributions and their changes as outcomes. Project Methods. The proposed project will apply innovative computing and ambient sensing technologies directly in participants' home and community environments to objectively assess IADL performance and variability among older adults with and without MCI in multiple clinically relevant functional domains for up to 4 years. Study involvement will also include annual neuropsychological and clinical testing. Machine learning computational approaches will be used to examine a large number of sensor-based IADL candidate variables generated through this study to determine the relative importance of these variables for discriminating between MCI and intact cognition groups, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Project Impact. The approaches used in this study will allow researchers, physicians, and caregivers to proactively identify and monitor increasing risks for deteriorating cognitive function (progressing from normal aging to MCI and from MCI to AD) in a way that is not currently possible, transforming AD prevention trials and significantly reducing the cost and consequences of functional decline in our aging population. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease, their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults with who are at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and the reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to assess day-to-day functioning in a new way which will more effectively identify the subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence.",Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease,9934965,R01AG058687,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Alzheimer disease prevention', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caregivers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Prevention', 'Prevention trial', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'functional decline', 'innovation', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'normal aging', 'pre-clinical', 'prodromal Alzheimer&apos', 's disease', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'time use']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,513654,-0.009439915675117434
"Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in older adults (≥65y) is rising, and there is limited evidence-based guidance on treating these older adults. In older patients with multi-morbidity, treatment decisions should factor in not only risk of disease complications, but also treatment complications and non-IBD, extra-intestinal complications. Hence, to inform optimal treatment approach, a comprehensive assessment of comparative effects of different therapies on all of these outcomes is warranted. Existing single-center observational studies are limited by small sample size, and missing data due to fragmented health care, whereas administrative claims-based studies are limited by lack of detailed clinical data; these limitations can be overcome by linking the two data sources. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Siddharth Singh proposes to: (Aim #1.1) characterize disease burden and treatment patterns, (Aim #1.2) assess and predict risks of death, disease, treatment and extra-intestinal complications using machine-learning algorithms and (Aim #2.1) compare overall effectiveness and (Aim #2.2) safety of different treatment strategies in older patients with IBD. This will be studied using a highly innovative informatics-based approach in a multi-site, electronic medical record (EMR)-based cohort of older patients with IBD, linked to their corresponding Medicare claims. The EMR-based cohort will facilitate phenotyping and disease severity assessment, and linkage to Medicare claims will augment exposure and outcome ascertainment, overcoming challenges of fragmentation of healthcare and short follow-up. The central hypothesis is that, that older adults have systematically different risk profiles than younger adults, and using biologic monotherapy is a safer and more effective approach to treating IBD, as compared to using long-term corticosteroids alone, non-biologic immunomodulator monotherapy, and combination therapy of biologics and immunomodulators. The access to the advanced infrastructure of pSCANNER (Patient-centered Scalable National Network for Effectiveness Research), one of 13 PCORI-funded Clinical Data Research Networks, and entire Medicare database, in a highly supportive and conducive environment at UCSD, with cross-disciplinary mentorship by a collaborative and experienced team of mentors and advisors from diverse backgrounds (clinical informatics, comparative effectiveness research, IBD therapeutics) is a key strength of this application. Besides directly informing clinical practice on treatment approaches in older patients with IBD, this proposal will enhance the career of the candidate by providing unique skills in applied clinical informatics, privacy-preserving record linkage techniques, predictive analytics, and comparative effectiveness research, and create a multi-institutional, EMR- based cohort of well-characterized IBD patients, linked with Medicare claims. This will ultimately contribute to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career focusing on comparative effectiveness research and population health management using novel informatics-based approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The information on comparative effectiveness and safety of different therapies in the context of patients' risk profile generated using this novel informatics-based approach in a unique linked EMR-Medicare database, will directly inform treatment of older patients with IBD, and enhance comparative effectiveness research methods.",Comparative Risks and Benefits of Pharmacological Therapies for Older Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,9919547,K23DK117058,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Fracture', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunomodulators', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Steroids', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Thromboembolism', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health management', 'high risk', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optimal treatments', 'patient oriented', 'personalized medicine', 'population health', 'privacy preservation', 'risk minimization', 'skills', 'treatment risk', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K23,2020,203990,0.09394590394893765
"Identifying Pathways Between Daily Stress and Long-Term Well-Being in Caregivers and Non-Caregivers Stressful experiences are generally thought to be harmful to mental and physical health. This perspective has guided research, informed policy, and colored the public narrative on the effects of caregiving for an impaired older adult. Indeed, many studies find greater depression, higher negative affect, and lower life satisfaction in caregivers (CGs) relative to non-caregivers (non-CGs).1,2 However, there is evidence that CGs experience positive effects despite, or perhaps because of, their stressful experiences.3 Research also finds that CGs live longer and are more resilient to perceived stress than non-CGs.4,5 Moreover, many CGs report psychological benefits like increased meaning in life, growing closer to the care recipient, and learning new skills.6,7 In a previous paper,8 the PI (Marino) suggested that these benefits reflect domains of eudaimonic well-being (EWB - meaning in life, positive relationships, personal growth, environmental mastery, autonomy, and self- acceptance) developed in positive psychology research9. Longitudinal change in EWB among CGs of impaired older adults has not yet been studied. Higher EWB has also been linked to lower reactivity to stressors,10,11 but has not been evaluated as an internal resource that promotes CGs' resilience to daily stress. The proposed project will fill these gaps by examining links between caregiving status and multiple dimensions of well-being including EWB, hedonic well-being (HWB - positive and negative affect and life satisfaction), and affective and physiological reactivity to daily stress. We will obtain a sample of propensity-matched CGs and non-CGs from the main survey of the population-based Midlife in the United States study and its daily diary study (the National Study of Daily Experiences) to identify within- and between- group differences in 1) EWB and HWB, cross- sectionally and over 20 years, and 2) exposure and reactivity to stressors over 8 days. In an exploratory aim, we will apply novel machine learning techniques to identify diverse conditions associated with typologies of optimal and sub-optimal well-being. The central hypothesis is that despite being associated with persistently lower HWB, caregiving for an impaired older adult is linked to greater increases in EWB over time. Further, longitudinal gains in EWB are predicted to weaken the association between stressor exposure and reactivity to daily stressors in CGs. The project is expected to help shift the current CG well-being paradigm by applying robust methods from developmental psychology to the caregiving context and generating novel information about how caring for an aging adult might affect well-being both negatively and positively, concurrently and over time. Findings can inform new psychological interventions that target EWB as a pathway to increasing resilience to daily stressors. The proposed training site will provide a scientific environment that is challenging and strongly supportive of the proposed project. Upon completion of the training plan, the PI will have a unique and diversified skill set for evaluating several domains of stress and well-being across time scales and will be prepared to lead future independent investigations to understand and promote positive outcomes among stress-prone adults like CGs. The proposed research will help identify both positive and negative effects of providing care to an impaired older adult and provide insight into caregivers' resilience to daily stressful experiences. As more adults become caregivers for an aging population, strategies are needed to optimize the short- and long-term effects of providing care. Thus, the proposed project is essential for the design of interventions that work towards NIA's mission of improving the health of older persons.",Identifying Pathways Between Daily Stress and Long-Term Well-Being in Caregivers and Non-Caregivers,10068660,F31AG066434,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Biological Markers', 'Caregiver well-being', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic stress', 'Color', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Disabled Children', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family member', 'Feeling', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pennsylvania', 'Perception', 'Personal Growth', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Stress and Coping', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Typology', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'affective disturbance', 'aging population', 'care recipients', 'caregiving', 'caregiving outcomes', 'caregiving research', 'developmental psychology', 'diaries', 'experience', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'men', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'multilevel analysis', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'perceived stress', 'person centered', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'population survey', 'pre-doctoral', 'psychologic', 'research data dissemination', 'resilience', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'stressor', 'therapy design']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,F31,2020,36231,0.09880654542169146
"Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study Project Summary Over 100 million Americans will be over age 65 years by 2060 (representing 25% of the U.S. population), with an increasing proportion of African-Americans. Understanding which Americans exhibit “exceptionally healthy aging”—an older life free of illness, disability, or functional limitation—is central to efforts to improve quality of life and resource utilization. Current investigations on “healthy aging” focus on systemic inflammatory markers (e.g., interleukin-6) or composite indices of organ/metabolic function (the “healthy aging index,” HAI), both lim- ited by a (1) lack of sensitivity for early changes in metabolism; (2) lack of specificity for molecular pathways involved in these changes; (3) absence of investigation early in adulthood (when “aging” may be reversible); (4) few studies of African-Americans, at high-risk for age-related morbidity. In preparation for this application, we applied metabolite profiling in a pilot study of nearly 300 African-American males in Health ABC, a biracial NIA study of elderly Caucasians and African-Americans, identifying metabolites associated with HAI (oxidative stress, nitric oxide signaling, gut microbial metabolism), some of which may be unique to African-Americans. Here, we hypothesize that circulating metabolites associated with multi-dimensional aging phenotypes and outcomes in older adults will define pathways of “exceptional healthy aging” that may be race-specific and dysregulated in youth at risk for “premature” aging. To address this hypothesis, we will harness two well- characterized, biracial American cohorts that span life (elderly: age 73±3 N=1312; young: CARDIA, age 32±4 N=2376; R01-HL136541). In Aim 1, we define metabolic pathways implicated in race-specific healthy aging, based on association between metabolites and validated age-related phenotypes heterogeneous by race (physical, neurocognitive function, vascular structure, body composition). We will assess determinants of iden- tified pathways, including dietary quality, physical activity, and psychosocial stress (poorer in African- Americans). In Aim 2, we identify metabolites related to “exceptionally healthy aging” in the elderly (freedom from disability, dementia, cancer, cardiovascular disease), their pathways, race-specificity, and overlap with pathways identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we apply machine-learning techniques to metabolites to derive a classi- fier for exceptionally healthy aging in Health ABC and apply this prediction rule to young adults in CARDIA to identify young adults at risk for unhealthy aging. We then investigate whether individuals marked for premature aging develop adverse aging phenotypes decades later (neurocognitive, physical, vascular, clinical outcome). This proposal addresses a core mission of the NIA (directly responsive to PA-17-088) by defining a metabolic basis for “exceptional healthy aging” across race and at the extremes of life. We leverage rich phenotypes within Health ABC, funded efforts within CARDIA, and a team experienced in aging epidemiology, metabolic research, and data science approaches. Successful completion of this project will furnish a rich molecular phe- notypic resource to the aging community for investigation of mechanisms and biomarkers of biological aging. Project Narrative Nearly 100 million Americans will be >65 years by 2060. Current clinical-biochemical metrics of aging do not capture accelerated aging, specifically the clinical observation that African Americans are at especially high risk of age-related morbidity. Here, we perform metabolite profiling in the Health ABC study to identify metabolic pathways central to healthy aging across race and examine these pathways in a separate longitudinal study of young adults (CARDIA), redefining aging as a systemic metabolic disease impacting function and outcomes in Caucasian and African-Americans across life.",Implications of metabolism on healthy aging in African and Caucasian Americans: the Health ABC study,9906155,R01AG059729,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body Composition', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caucasians', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Diet', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Freedom', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Interleukin-6', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Premature aging syndrome', 'Preparation', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'ST14 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'biracial', 'caucasian American', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'disability', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fitness', 'healthy aging', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'male', 'mental state', 'microbial', 'middle age', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sarcopenia', 'walking speed', 'young adult']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,611864,0.056875536236769574
"Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are typically the result of neurodegenerative processes that begin 15-20 years before clinical diagnosis. Despite this lengthy subclinical phase and advances in early diagnostic technologies including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain MRIs, and positron emission tomography (PET) measures there are no scalable biomarkers to identify individuals with preclinical disease, which may offer the best time window for intervention. Specifically, because brain MRI and PET tests are resource-intensive and CSF sampling is invasive, there is urgent need for biomarkers based on blood samples, which can be non-invasively collected even in centers lacking highly specialized technology. The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), unlike the stable nuclear genome, is dynamic and accumulates somatic mutations over the lifespan. Mutations in the mtDNA can be induced by oxidative stress and lead to declining mitochondrial function as we age; in turn, less functional mitochondria generate higher levels of oxidative stress, which induces chronic inflammation and tissue injury in specific organs including the brain. Yet, no study has investigated mtDNA mutations as early predictors of ADRD. We hypothesize that individuals with higher levels and faster accumulation of blood mtDNA mutations have greater cognitive decline and preclinical ADRD brain imaging changes during midlife, and that these mtDNA biomarkers will predict ADRD diagnosis in older adults. We will test our hypotheses by leveraging the NHLBI-funded Coronary Artery Risk Development In young Adults (CARDIA) study. CARDIA is a multicenter, community-based, longitudinal cohort that recruited 5,115 black and white young adults (mean age 25 years), followed them up at least every five years, and is preparing to conduct its examination Year 35 (Y35) visit in 2020/21 (mean age 60 years) when over 3,000 participants are expected to return. We will use state-of-the-art deep sequencing technology to measure mtDNA mutations in CARDIA blood samples collected at Y15, Y25, and Y35. In Aim 1, we will determine whether higher levels of mtDNA mutations and their accumulation over time are associated with greater cognitive decline in midlife. In Aim 2, we will determine whether mtDNA mutations are associated with structural, physiological, and functional MRI phenotypes of preclinical ADRD as well as with sensitive MRI-based markers of accelerated brain aging and preclinical ADRD constructed by our team using contemporary machine learning techniques. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the clinical utility of these mtDNA mutation biomarkers in identifying individuals at risk of future ADRD in four older cohorts that have large numbers of longitudinally identified, clinically-diagnosed ADRD. Our focus on longitudinal measures of blood mtDNA, cognitive function, and MRI changes over a 10- year period during midlife, combined with characterization of their clinical utility in older populations, is highly innovative. If successful, our study may help initiate possible future interventions in early midlife and reduce the public health and medical burden of AD and dementia. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT This study has high potential for characterizing novel blood-based biomarkers to identify preclinical ADRD and test their utility in predicting clinical ADRD. No other study has a similar design with repeated blood mtDNA mutations, cognitive assessments, and brain imaging data during midlife, a critical time window for interventions to prevent clinical ADRD development. By also using data from four large cohorts of older adults, we can determine the clinical utility of these mtDNA biomarkers to predict clinical ADRD and move the field closer toward the NIH’s goal of personalized health interventions.",Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study,10055446,R01AG069120,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nuclear', 'Older Population', 'Organ', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep sequencing', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome sequencing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'middle age', 'mitochondrial DNA mutation', 'mitochondrial genome', 'novel', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'tissue injury', 'tool', 'whole genome', 'young adult']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,852784,-0.04099260296274234
"Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality Abstract Older adults struggle to engage in health enhancing physical activity (PA) and spend up to 11 hours a day sitting. Older women, in particular, are at increased risk of chronic disease and disability, and use a high proportion of healthcare resources. Improving both these behaviors has promise for improving several salient aging outcomes, but evidence to inform guidelines on how best to interrupt long periods of sedentary behavior (SB) are lacking. Few laboratory-based trials have included adults over 70 years old, have focused on PA to interrupt SB, and have not tested standing breaks that might be acceptable to older adults. A recent review showed that in the real world, traditional PA interventions do not meaningfully impact SB. In contrast, interventions that focus on standing can reduce SB, up to 2 hours per day. Epidemiological studies have shown associations between self-reported SB and increased risks of death and metabolic outcomes, but very few prospective studies have employed objective measures of SB. Although accelerometer measures can indicate the intensity of movement or lack of it, traditional cutpoints do not accurately classify behaviors such as sitting, standing or walking. While pilot intervention studies, using thigh worn inclinometers, have demonstrated that SB can be greatly reduced, there are no RCTs in older adults with health outcomes. There is much room for improvement in our understanding of SB and healthy aging. The National Institute on Aging conducted a summer workshop series to address this issue in 2013. We have therefore designed a Program project – Sedentary Time and Aging Research (STAR) – to provide more rigorous and comprehensive evidence on how to interrupt sitting time and the consequences for healthy aging. In particular, we are proposing a paradigm shift away from energy expenditure as the primary mechanism for health outcomes to investigating behaviors such as brief sit-to-stand transitions that expend little energy but engage muscles, improve postural blood flow, and may impact physical functioning in older adults. Further, we will study a broader range of outcomes than investigated to date, including targeted novel mechanisms important for healthy aging. The STAR program will include 3 Projects and 2 Cores for study of postmenopausal women at risk for chronic disease. STAR includes 2 randomized trials, in the laboratory (N=86) and in the real world (N=592), with focus on optimizing new computational techniques to apply to existing prospective accelerometer data (n>6000). All projects will investigate the consequences of extended sitting, standing, brief sit-to-stand transitions and PA breaks on mechanisms of healthy aging including glucose regulation, endothelial functioning, and mitochondrial functioning. We will also investigate physical functioning, blood pressure and in Project 3, 5-7 year mortality risk. All Projects will compare effects across age groups. STAR will provide a comprehensive evidence base that can inform public health guidelines on SB and aging. We will coordinate our efforts with a new American Heart Association Center on SB and Latinas.  Narrative Sitting time may be particularly bad for the health of older women. This program grant will provide new and improved evidence to help the public understand how to interrupt sitting in ways that support healthy aging.  ","Sedentary Behaviour Interrupted: Acute, medium and long-term effects on biomarkers of healthy aging, physical function and mortality",9949575,P01AG052352,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Computational Technique', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Endothelium', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Latina', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Mitochondria', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Postmenopause', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Thigh structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'age effect', 'age group', 'attentional control', 'base', 'behavior observation', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'disability', 'emotional functioning', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'exercise intervention', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'older women', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'response biomarker', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'young adult']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",P01,2020,1750278,0.06235700772360702
"Robot-Assisted Cognitive Training for Socially Isolated Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment This project will develop a Socially-Assistive Robot (SAR) to provide cognitive training, in the form of learning to play the piano, to improve cognitive functioning and reduce feelings of loneliness in socially-isolated older adults. The SAR will administer cognitive training via guided practice on a set of standard piano lesson tasks designed to reflect particular cognitive functions: memory, attention, language, and social acuity. The goals of this project are that the SAR will (1) engage the persons with mild cognitive impairment (PMCI) in skill-building cognitive music training; (2) enhance cognitive functioning, in particular verbal and visual memory, reasoning ability, and complex attention; and (3) reduce feelings of loneliness. This SAR can be used as both a personalized social companion and an interactive tutor to deliver customized training for cognitive functioning and social engagement. We have assembled a strong multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, roboticists, engineers, human factors specialists, neuroscientists, and gerontologists, well suited to achieve goals. Dementia is a costly chronic disease; an estimated $259 billion was spent in 2017 for health care, long-term care, and out-of-pocket expenses. Furthermore, social isolation is a problem many older adults face, with 1 in 3 older adults reporting loneliness in the United States. Socially assistive robotics (SARs) have the potential to provide mental and social engagement – especially for those older adults who may lack social connections. In particular, SARs can utilize machine learning to provide customized and socially-engaging cognitive training for lonely older adults with MCI.",Robot-Assisted Cognitive Training for Socially Isolated Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment,9991722,R42AG060800,"['Adoption', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Attention', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Esthetics', 'Face', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Loneliness', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'Music', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Reporting', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social Concepts', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Specialist', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Uninsured Medical Expense', 'United States', 'aged', 'body language', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive training', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidisciplinary', 'preference', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'robot assistance', 'robot interface', 'sensory integration', 'skills', 'social', 'social assistive robot', 'social engagement', 'tutoring', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'visual memory', 'web app']",NIA,APPLIED UNIVERSAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION,R42,2020,1981401,0.10068656597919655
"Voice2Connect: Informing the Design of Smart Speakers for Social Connectedness in Low-Income Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract There is a growing public health concern regarding the high risk of social isolation and loneliness among low- income older adults and its resulting impact on their longevity and overall well-being. The issue of social isolation is particularly relevant to low-income senior housing (LISH) residents who often have multiple chronic conditions and disabilities, lack of financial and social resources, and limited social networks. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop innovative approaches to mitigate these issues in older adults living in LISH. Voice- operated smart speakers have the potential to reduce social isolation and loneliness in this population, for example, by connecting with other people, sending a reminder about social activities, or providing a conversational agent. The hands-free voice control provides improved accessibility and usability for people with low literacy, vision impairment, mobility limitation, or poor dexterity issues. We propose to examine how smart speakers can support the needs of social connectedness among older adults living alone in LISH. We will use an iterative user-centered design and employ a mixed-methods approach, incorporating participatory methods, focus group interviews, and functional and psychosocial health questionnaires. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to determine experiences of social isolation, user needs, user context, and preferences related to the use of smart speakers for social connectedness in the LISH setting, (2) to evaluate older adults (smart speaker users and non-users)’ and stakeholders’ attitudes towards the in-home use of smart speakers for promoting social engagement, with a focus on perceived usability and usefulness of the technology, and (3) to identify potential implementation barriers and privacy concerns among older adults and stakeholders. Stakeholders will include housing staff members (N=10) and health care professionals (N=6) providing wellness services to LISH residents. Older adults (N=36) will form six focus groups and take part in a series of three focus group sessions in which they participate in user-centered design activities to identify potential smart speaker features that can support the needs of social connectedness. Their thoughts and ideas will be used to develop low-fidelity prototypes and scenarios of use for each prototype. After prototype and scenario development, we will seek input from the older adults, housing staff, and health care providers through focus groups, which will be used to refine the prototype. The refined prototypes will be validated with the older adult participants. We will use a thematic analysis and inductive coding method to analyze focus group interview transcripts. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze the questionnaire data collected from older adults and stakeholders. Findings from this study will inform our future research where we build smart speaker algorithms and functionalities that can facilitate the planning of innovative smart speaker-based social connectedness interventions for older adults in LISH. Project Narrative The proposed study aims to examine how smart speaker technologies can support the needs for social connectedness among older adults living alone in low-income senior housing communities. This study is highly relevant to public health as it represents an early exploration of what potential features and functionalities of smart speakers can address the issue of social isolation and loneliness in low-income senior housing residents. Findings from this study will facilitate the planning of low-cost, innovative technology-based interventions for reducing social isolation and improving social connections for our most vulnerable aging U.S. population.",Voice2Connect: Informing the Design of Smart Speakers for Social Connectedness in Low-Income Older Adults,10094326,R03AG069816,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Group Interviews', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Leisure Activities', 'Loneliness', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Services', 'Site', 'Social Network', 'Social isolation', 'Social support', 'Staff Attitudes', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Transcript', 'Transportation', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'Visual impairment', 'Voice', 'Wellness Program', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'community living', 'cost', 'design', 'dexterity', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'intelligent personal assistant', 'literacy', 'member', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'preference', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'social', 'social capital', 'social engagement', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'virtual']",NIA,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,77625,0.11505363890549042
"Socially-Assistive Robots for Alzheimer's (SARA) Project Summary/Abstract  The objective of this Phase I Socially-Assistive Robots for Alzheimer’s (SARA) effort is to design and demonstrate the feasibility of a socially integrative and supportive robot system to enhance the connectedness, caregiving, well-being, and quality of life of older adults experiencing early to middle stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD). One in 10 people 65 and older has AD, with estimates of up to as many as 5.5 million Americans currently living with AD. Because of the loss of cognitive function and subsequent changes in employment and reduced engagement with social groups and hobbies, AD/ADRD patients often experience loneliness and social isolation, and the considerable challenge of caring for these individuals often causes similar effects in caregivers. If successful, SARA will have significant impact on AD/ADRD patient care and quality of life, reducing loneliness and social isolation.  The specific aims of this two-year pilot study are to: (1) adapt commercial robot and peripheral hardware to create accessible interactions for AD/ADRD patients; (2) design and develop the robot interaction software to provide rich, supportive interaction; and (3) assess the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of SARA with AD/ADRD older adults and their caregivers. SARA employs user-community-driven design processes and evaluations to address key challenges surrounding how to best apply commercial robots and engaging interaction methodologies to improve AD/ADRD patient care. We will develop SARA through an iterative development process that produces and evaluates three versions of the system during the Phase I effort.  SARA is significant in three ways. SARA reduces loneliness by providing robotic social interactions. SARA reduces social isolation by connecting the patient more closely with family, friends, and caregivers, both directly and through social media. SARA provides social assistance in three ways: (1) through automated reminders and question answering for everyday information that is easily and often forgotten by patients; (2) conveyance of health regimens (e.g., What can I have for lunch? Should I still exercise today?); and (3) monitoring for caregivers.  SARA contains three central innovations. First, to create a user experience that is well tuned to the needs of patients and caregivers, SARA is created with significant feedback from AD/ADRD patients and caregivers. Second, to enable us to build on multiple robotic platforms that can meet this user experience, and to provide future extensibility, SARA features a platform-agnostic software and hardware framework that can integrate with a wide range of consumer social robots. Third, to create engaging, believable, and effective interactions with AD/ADRD patients, SARA uses and extends an AI-based architecture, Hap, which is specifically designed to create socially engaging interactive characters and robots that provide enjoyable and stimulating interactions. Project Narrative  As many as 5.5 million Americans may have Alzheimer’s disease, an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, eventually impairing the ability to carry out even the simplest tasks. Socially-Assistive Robots for Alzheimer’s (SARA) is a socially integrative and supportive robot to enhance the connectedness, caregiving, well-being, and quality of life of older adults experiencing early to middle stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD).

"SCH: INT: Inferring at home gait parameters of older adults using floor vibrations   The United States population is growing older. There is an urgent need for tools to better connect health professionals with their patients and perform at-home assessments in an automated fashion. The long-term goal of this proposal is to discover the knowledge necessary to enable an always-on, non-intrusive, non-wearable smart system for automated at-home gait parameter estimation using floor vibrations. To achieve this vision, the proposal has the objective of connecting health professionals with older adults living independently through a smart system that estimates gait parameters using floor vibration. The aims to achieve this goal are to 1) determine at-home gait parameters as a function of time and space; 2) establish a digital identifier of the older adult based on gait parameters; and 3) correlate changes in at-home gait parameters, after considering spatial-temporal correlations, with changes in the well-being of the resident. The proposed research will advance the state-of-the-art in engineering, physical therapy and public health by testing the following hypotheses: 1) Floor vibration is a viable means to automatically and continuously determine gait parameters; 2) For healthy individuals living in an independent at-home setting, gait parameters will be consistent based on location in the home, time of the day and day of the week; and 3) For patients recently discharged from the hospital, recovery will correlate with improvements in their gait parameters. The testing of the hypotheses will be performed through five tasks: 1) Develop an automated system to capture floor vibration and extract gait parameters; 2) Validate the system in laboratory setting; 3) Collect data at participant’s homes; 4) Test the hypothesis that at-home gait parameters are consistent with time and space; 5) Test the hypothesis that improvement in gait parameters correlates improvement in health status of recently discharged patients. This research will be pursued by a group of interdisciplinary researchers in engineering and physical therapy with the support of an experienced geriatric physician and will advance the knowledge in signal processing techniques, estimation and validation of at-home gait parameters and their uncertainty, and relationship between changes at-home gait parameters and changes in health status. The proposed activities will have a significant impact on older adult care, the research community and the next generation of researchers and engineers stemming from: 1) improved health of older adults and reduced health care cost by early intervening and thus decreasing the readmission rate; 2) increased scientific literacy and public engagement through benchmark problems, interdisciplinary seminars, new courses and outreach activities; 3) the training of diverse convergence researchers competent in solving interdisciplinary problems, including underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The proposed research aligns with the mission of National Institute of Aging by developing automated, non-intrusive, privacy-preserving at-home gait assessment tools based on floor vibrations to correlate changes of gait parameters with the health status of older adults. The outcomes of this project will enable health professionals to monitor the well-being of the older population and manage recovery paradigms thereby improving the health and well-being of older Americans.",SCH: INT: Inferring at home gait parameters of older adults using floor vibrations  ,10019453,R01AG067395,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Benchmarking', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Communities', 'Controlled Environment', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Floor', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Professional', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physical therapy', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'STEM field', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'outreach', 'privacy preservation', 'readmission rates', 'scientific literacy', 'signal processing', 'spatial relationship', 'stem', 'tool', 'vibration']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2020,297989,0.12290769275091738
"Modernizing the Assessment of Financial Decision Making: Development and Evaluation of a Simulated Online Money Management Task in Older Adults The advent of digital finance and online money management (OMM) services has changed the ways in which we conduct everyday transactions. Based on my preliminary F32 survey findings, the number of older adults who use technology is drastically growing and the way they approach financial transactions is certainly changing. Given the increasing number of older adults and corresponding diseases of aging such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), the vulnerability of older adults to financial exploitation, and the pervasiveness of financial decision making in everyday life, it is critical to be able to accurately examine financial decision making using objective, quantifiable, and ecologically valid tasks that are in keeping with the current trends. In 2016, an expert panel working for the US Social Security Administration found a gap between the current assessment of financial decision making and real-world financial performance. The current proposal seeks to bridge this gap by developing and applying simulation technology-based OMM task to assess financial decision making in individuals across the spectrum of cognitive aging. Accordingly, the first two aims (K99/Mentored phase) of the current proposal are to establish the reliability and validity of a novel, simulated OMM credit card statement review task in cognitively healthy older adults via psychometrically rigorous approaches. The third and fourth inferential aims (R00 phase) are to use: (i) a longitudinal strategy to track OMM over time and in relation to cognitive changes in cognitively healthy older adults, and (ii) a cross-sectional strategy to examine OMM in two clinical groups (mild AD and those judged as financially incapable by Adult Protective Services) versus healthy older adults. To accomplish these aims, I will develop advanced skills to supplement my strong neuropsychological training, by: 1) gaining expertise in developing and conducting functional assessments using state-of-the-art technology; 2) developing a deeper knowledge of psychometric measurement to optimize task design; and 3) enriching my conceptual understanding of financial decision making while learning how to incorporate neuroeconomic principles and metacognitive assessment in financial decision making measurement. I have assembled an excellent and well-rounded mentorship team consisting of a computer scientist, biostatistician, gerontologist, economist, and expert neuropsychologists. Overall, this K99/R00 proposal enables me to lay a foundation for an independent research career focused on using technology to accurately conceptualize financial decision making in cognitively diverse older adults, a goal that is in line with the NIA’s mission to improve “the health, well-being, and independence of adults as they age”. Older adults, a wealthy segment of the population, are known to exhibit compromised financial decision making especially in the context of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease. As the landscape of financial decision making has changed dramatically with rapid technological advances, there is a growing gap between the skills necessary for everyday financial decision making and the way it in which it is assessed clinically. Given the precipitous, ongoing and projected increase in the number of older adults and their use of technology, it is imperative to develop financial decision making measures that approximate real world functioning in the current technological culture that can inform clinical determination of financial decision making abilities, and shape public policies aimed at minimizing financial losses.",Modernizing the Assessment of Financial Decision Making: Development and Evaluation of a Simulated Online Money Management Task in Older Adults,9902295,K99AG062783,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Factor Analysis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Psychologist', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Policy', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Review Literature', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'United States Social Security Administration', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Writing', 'age related', 'alertness', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive task', 'design', 'digital', 'executive function', 'exhaustion', 'financial decision making', 'financial exploitation', 'financial literacy', 'improved', 'instrument', 'literacy', 'middle age', 'neuroeconomics', 'novel', 'online course', 'preservation', 'rate of change', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2020,132227,0.12876859183065154
"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,9830682,R01NR016423,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Gait', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'active control', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'fitness', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'improved', 'information display', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'preference', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'walking speed', 'wearable sensor technology']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2020,100000,0.05785451971571519
"Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) is a challenge our society must address. While the future of healthcare availability and quality of services seems uncertain, at the same time advances in pervasive computing and intelligent embedded systems provides innovative strategies to meet these needs. One particular need which technology can help address is assessment and assistance with a person's functional performance. The long-term goal of this work is to develop technologies that will improve the independent functioning and quality of life of individuals with functional limitations (particularly individuals with ADRDs) and reduce their reliance on caregivers. The primary objective of this application is to develop a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and assistance with everyday activities. Building on our prior collaborative work, our approach will be to collect and fuse multi-modal functional performance data from ambient sensors, mobile sensors, free text, and assessment apps (Aim 1). This fused “human behaviorome” will provide a basis, together with observation-based ground truth, for automated functional assessment and validation of each component technology, including the use of compensatory strategies, through in-person observation and through video recording of typical daily activities and strategies (Aim 2). Finally, using iterative, user-centered assessment of prompt-based assistance, we will evaluate the ability of activity segmentation and forecasting techniques to provide automated support for activity initiation and accurate completion of everyday activities (Aim 3). The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide insights on functional health revealed within a person's everyday environment that have not been investigated in prior work. The results can also help to extend functional independence through real-time assistance, while the outcomes can assist family planning, provision of care, and design of real-world and lab-based measures of functional performance. This work is important because of the increasing number of older individuals experiencing cognitive and functional limitations due to chronic health conditions. Furthermore, they address the need for individuals to remain functionally independent as long as possible in their own homes, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and provide assistance with everyday activities for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings for functional health assessment and intervention. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline,10092007,R01AG065218,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Automation', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Family Planning', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive rehabilitation', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'health assessment', 'health care availability', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'research clinical testing', 'sensor', 'smart home']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,600384,0.049552509269710145
"Prospective Monitoring of Newly Approved Cardiovascular Drugs in Older Adults with Frailty PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects 70% of older adults and remains the leading cause of morbidity and mor- tality in the United States. Several new drugs have recently been approved for CVD, but not enough is known about their utilization, benefits and risks in frail older patients. Since conducting a clinical trial in frail older adults can be costly and impractical, there is a pressing need for innovative strategies to generate evidence on new CVD drugs in a timely manner. The objective of this application is to establish a near-real-time prospective monitoring program in Medicare data to evaluate the benefit of new CVD drugs for older adults with frailty. A prospective monitoring program seeks to find early effectiveness and safety signals of new drugs by updating the analysis at regular intervals as new Medicare data become available. The investigators will incorporate a novel claims-based frailty index into the monitoring program to generate timely evidence on disease-specific and patient-centered net benefit of new drugs by frailty status. The central hypothesis is that disease-specific benefit and net benefit are determined by a patient's degree of frailty. Disease-specific benefit will be evaluated using clinical trial endpoints of effectiveness (e.g., CVD events) and safety (e.g., bleeding), and net benefit in terms of the number of days alive and spent at home, or “home time”. To conduct this work, the investigators will analyze Medicare data on 6 new CVD drugs approved in 2011-2017: 3 anticoagulants vs warfarin for atrial fibrillation, 2 antiplatelets vs clopidogrel for atherosclerotic CVD, and an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor vs enalapril for systolic heart failure. The validity and reproducibility of the results will be enhanced through the linkage of a subset of Medicare data to electronic health records and a national survey to supplement clinical information, and external validation of the Medicare data analysis in 2 large commercial databases. In the next 4 years, the investigators will accomplish 3 specific aims: 1) evaluate the temporal trends and predictors of new CVD drug use in frail and non-frail older adults with CVD over 2011-2020; 2) determine disease-specific benefit (deaths, CVD and safety events) and net benefit (home time) of 6 new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies; 3) identify patient characteristics that can predict net benefit (home time) with new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies. This proposal's innovative approach, which combines near-real-time prospective monitor- ing, a claims-based frailty score, and the patient-centered outcome of home time, offers a readily scalable and feasible framework for comparative effectiveness and safety studies of newly approved medications. The impact of the proposed research is significant because timely evidence generated from real-world healthcare data can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new CVD drugs based on a patient's frailty and expected net benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to establish a prospective monitoring program for newly approved cardiovascular drugs for older adults with frailty in routine healthcare databases and identify predictors of benefit from the new drugs. This research is relevant to public health because the evidence generated from this work can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new cardiovascular drugs in older adults based on a patient's frailty level and expected net benefit.

"High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression Project Summary/Abstract: Depression (target disease of this proposal) affects 34 million Americans including 2 million seniors per year. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults (target population of this proposal). The vascular depression hypothesis (proposed in 1998) remains the most salient theory explaining the onset and perpetuation of depression in older adults. This model is based on the observation that in older adults, white matter hyperintensities (a hallmark of small vessel disease, SVD) are associated with depression onset and perpetuation. Progress in understanding the relationship of small vessel disease with late-life depression has been stymied in part by lack of specificity of white matter hyperintensities which can represent components of edema, gliosis, ischemia, and inflammation. Traditional MR imaging is unable to distinguish between these components, and thus the specific mechanisms that contribute to depression remain unclear.  The emergence of ultrahigh field MR imaging allows for greater specificity of the WMH lesions, and other components of small vessel disease. Bringing 7 tesla (T) imaging into mainstream clinical use will be accomplished through 1) having exclusive (over 1.5/3T) application(s) and 2) achieving robust, safe, consistent, and homogenous high-quality images. Through a consortium consisting of experts at University of Pittsburgh combined with collaboration at FDA, University of Minnesota, and Quality Electrodynamics Inc., our goal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. We will achieve this goal through the development of robust radiofrequency methodology, as well as pulse sequences that produce 7T images with the aforementioned necessary attributes. This will be paired with complementary 3T MRI at baseline. We will use our recently developed (as well as a proposed) custom designed 7T radiofrequency coil system and pulse sequences that are already being used in disease/patient studies. Based on our preliminary results, the proposed RF solution will provide unprecedented homogeneity and consistency among different subjects/patients, and therefore excellent signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio for detection of components of small vessel disease. The study will examine two cohorts 1) a group of 30 older adults recruited through the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) for developing an MRI to histopathology statistical model of SVD and 2) 60 older adults with late-life depression who will undergo scanning at baseline and after 2 years. The longitudinal 7T MRI and SVD model will be used to help characterize the small vessel changes associated with depression in older adults.  In summary, this study develops an emerging and timely technology (high-performance ultrahigh field MRI) to study a critical pathophysiological process (cerebral small vessel disease) in a clinically relevant population (Late-Life Depression). This project will further advance all of these three domains. Project Narrative: The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology, treatment, and management of depression in older adults. This will be accomplished through the development of radiofrequency hardware, methodology, pulse sequences and protocols using 7 Tesla (T) human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in conjunction with complimentary 3T MRI. The clinical relevance of the proposed tools will be achieved through comprehensive characterization of 1) components of cerebral small vessel disease in individuals with late-life depression and 2) progression of small vessel disease markers over 2 years. One of our overarching goals is to achieve a highly useful 7T clinical utility, which requires high quality, robust, and consistent acquisitions. This could be a potentially exclusive (over other human MRI field strengths) application for 7T imaging.",High Performance Imaging for Assessment of Small Vessel Disease in Older Adults with Depression,9955317,R01MH111265,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Consultations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Edema', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Gliosis', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Heating', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'Work', 'absorption', 'affective disturbance', 'aging brain', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'follow-up', 'geriatric depression', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'radio frequency', 'recruit', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'vascular depression']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,611884,0.08460583172114583
"BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Vaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal disease, and shingles lead to significant rates of illness, hospitalization, and death among older adults. In the United States, vaccination rates have been mostly unchanged for a decade with lower rates among racial and ethnic minority groups. New and scalable approaches are needed to address this important public health issue. Nudges are changes to the way choices are offered or information is framed that can have outsized effects on behavior. For example, default options are the path of least resistance and the action that takes place if no alternatives are selected. Active choice is a method that prompts a decision-making now, rather than waiting for stakeholders to recognize the need to make the decision on their own. Our groups at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn Medicine) and the University of Washington (UW Medicine) have formed behavioral design teams embedded within the operations of our health systems and have demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, this scalable technology platform is an optimal environment to implement and deploy these types of nudges. In this study, we propose to design, test, and implemented personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target barriers among high-risk subgroups to improve vaccination rates. We will pilot this at two health systems and then implement a pragmatic trial at those health systems and sites in the VA Health System. In the R61 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine and UW Medicine. Aim 1: To use EHR data and analytical methods to identify high-risk groups of older adults with suboptimal vaccination rates for influenza, pneumococcal disease, and herpes zoster. Aim 2: To assess the feasibility of implementing different types of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to target the identified groups to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 3: To pilot test ways to personalize promising nudges to clinicians and patients for improving vaccination among older adults. In the R33 phase, we will focus on the following aims at Penn Medicine, UW Medicine, and the VA Health System. Aim 1: To conduct a 12-month, multisite, cluster randomized, pragmatic trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients relative to control to improve vaccination rates among older adults. Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on reducing disparities in vaccination rates related to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic factors. Aim 3: To evaluate heterogeneity in treatment effect across clinician, patient, and practice characteristics to further tailor approaches in future intervention design. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many older adults are at risk of illness, hospitalization, and death from vaccine-preventable diseases. Moreover, there are significant racial and ethnic disparities in care with even lower vaccination rates among African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. In this study, we will use analytical methods to identify high-risk subgroups, test personalized nudges to address barriers among these groups, and then implement a pragmatic, multisite trial to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized nudges to clinicians and patients to improve vaccination rates among older adults and reduce disparities in care.",BE IMMUNE: Behavioral Economics to Improve and Motivate vaccination Using Nudges through the EHR,10050234,R61AG068945,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'African American', 'Asians', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Data Analytics', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Herpes zoster disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Pneumococcal Infections', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive Health Services', 'Preventive care', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Vendor', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Workload', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'ethnic minority population', 'health care disparity', 'health service use', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'multi-site trial', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'peer', 'personalized approach', 'pragmatic trial', 'prescription opioid', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'response', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'treatment effect']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R61,2020,315340,0.1085446298071146
"Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The National Institute of Health report Diabetes in America (2018) noted that 39.5% of adults with diabetes are aged ≥ 65 years, and the prevalence of diabetes in older adults is dramatically increasing. Management of diabetes in older adults in nursing homes is challenging due to this population having heterogeneous comorbid medical conditions, and associated medications, many of which are contraindicated for common antidiabetic drugs. Intensive diabetes management in older adults is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Drug induced hypoglycemia is the 3rd most common adverse drug event among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries. Hypoglycemia is experienced by 18% to 40% of nursing home residents. There is a lack of observational or clinical evidence pertaining to antidiabetic treatments in long-term care nursing home residents, despite this population being at high risk for diabetes, diabetes-related complications, and adverse effects of antidiabetic drugs. The American Diabetes Association’s consensus report on diabetes in older adults noted that “There are essentially no directly applicable clinical trial data on glucose control for large segments of the older diabetic patient population.” Furthermore, there are few real-world studies of antidiabetic treatments in nursing home residents. In recognition of this knowledge gap in this high-risk population, the Diabetes Mellitus Interagency Coordinating Committee, as reported in the NIDDK Recent Advances & Emerging Opportunities (2019), issued a call for studies that increase our understanding of diabetes treatments in long-term care settings, with a particular emphasis on the need to understand the impact of cognitive and functional impairments, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and risk of hypoglycemia. These priorities are central to our proposed scope of research. Using the Federally-mandated Minimum Data Set 3.0, linked to Medicare Part A and D claims, the aims are to: 1) characterize antidiabetic treatment practices among nursing home residents; 2) identify and describe clinically relevant phenotypes of diabetic nursing home residents based on patterns of cognitive/functional impairments, comorbidities, and treatment procedures/medications, and 3) estimate the occurrence of hospitalizations (overall, hypoglycemia-related, and hypoglycemia-specific) by propensity- matched patterns of antidiabetic treatments, across resident phenotypes. We hypothesize that risks associated with antidiabetic treatments will be heterogeneous across resident phenotypes. We anticipate that the phenotypic approach we propose will serve as a foundation for future work to conduct phenotypic-specific comparative effectiveness research in support of evidence-based personalized antidiabetic treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nursing home residents have a high prevalence of diabetes and high risks of diabetes complications. There is limited observational or clinical evidence supporting antidiabetic treatment decisions in long-term care nursing home residents. This study will examine the use and safety of antidiabetic treatments across subgroups (phenotypes) of older nursing home residents with diabetes.",Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents,9957331,R21NR019160,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Age Distribution', 'Age-Years', 'American', 'Americas', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Area', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Coin', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care Nursing', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Medication Management', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse event risk', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'crosslink', 'diabetes management', 'diabetes risk', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'human old age (65+)', 'instrument', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'patient population', 'person centered', 'personalized medicine', 'trend', 'virtual']",NINR,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R21,2020,251250,0.08381268611862211
