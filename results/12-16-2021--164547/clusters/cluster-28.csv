"Urban Latino African American Cancer Disparities Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   The Urban Latino-African American Cancer Disparity Project (ULAAC Disparities Project) links Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital (DFMH), a community hospital in service of a high need/low resource urban community (45% Latino, 45% African American) with major research institutions; University of Southern California and University of California San Francisco, and RAND to create a permanent clinical trials infrastructure. This collaboration generates an unprecedented opportunity to reduce disparities in access to radiation oncology, cancer prevention and translational research trials as well as demonstrate an intervention model with potential application to similar urban communities throughout the nation. The Project builds and stabilizes independent and collaborative clinical research capabilities of DFMH with its partners and improves ability to extend access to radiation oncology clinical research to African American and Latino persons with cancer and at high risk for cancer. The Project uses a cultural and language appropriate to the Health Educator to outreach to potential patients for Project-sponsored clinical and prevention trials, explain the benefits of trials participation, and identify and recruit trials participants. The Health Educator identifies potential Project patients through the 383 primary care physicians in the Project's target service community.  Outreach through primary care physicians builds on established patient and physician relationships that can, with Project interventions, overcome patient reticence and other barriers to clinical totals. The assignment of patients to Patient Navigators facilitates the care process by improving coordination of care functions that will in turn improve the quality of the medical interaction and increase enrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials. The Project demonstrates the use of a Health Educator and Patient Navigator-facilitated interventions to recruit and encourage African American and Latino persons with breast or prostate cancer or at high risk for these conditions to participate in and successfully complete radiation oncology clinical trials, a partial breast irradiation trial, cancer prevention trials and certain translational research investigations. A crucial Project component is systematic evaluation. The evaluation assesses the needs and concerns of stakeholders and provides ongoing feedback and suggests alternative approaches.

"MS/AL Radiation Oncology Research Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   The Mississippi/Alabama Radiation Oncology Research Partnership is formed to establish and sustain a radiation oncology research program that will address cancer disparities among African Americans and underserved populations in the Mississippi region. The potential partners include the Regional Cancer Center (RCC) at Singing River Hospital System (SRHS) in Pascagoula, Mississippi, the University of Alabama Comprehensive Cancer Center (UABCCC) in Birmingham, Alabama, and the Gulf Coast Minority-Based Cooperative Clinical Oncology Program (MBCCOP). The overall goal of the proposed partnership is to improve access and accrual of cancer clinical trials for African American and historically underserved populations. Clinical trials are the principal tools for achieving and demonstrating progress in cancer treatment and prevention. Unfortunately, the level of accrual of African Americans and underserved populations in clinical trials is disproportionate to the disease burden. In addition, many health care institutions that provide care to a disproportionate number of these populations are not often linked to the national cancer research protocols. As a result, radiation oncologists in these institutions have a difficult time starting, developing, and sustaining research programs. Thus, this proposed partnership seeks funding to support the planning, development, and implementation of a radiation oncology clinical trials program. Three pilot clinical trials research projects will be conducted as part of implementation of the research program to address patient accrual. Project #1 is the ""Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer."" Project #2 is ""Phase II study of Gamma Knife Radiosurgery and Temozolomide (Temodar) for Newly Diagnosed Brain Metastases."" Project #3 is ""Evaluation of Prostate Screening Outcomes in African American Men."" The proposed research plan will enable investigators to examine whether increasing access to cancer clinical research trials will increase accrual and participation. The partnership collaboration will serve as the major vehicle for building a research infrastructure and generating new findings in radiation oncology that may impact cancer disparities in African American and underserved populations.

"Western Regional Community Clinical Oncology Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Greater Phoenix CCOP is a consortium of five hospitals with 40 investigators, led by principal investigator, David King, MD. Dr. King and many of the investigators have been associated with the CCOP since its inception in 1982. The continuing long-term goals and specific aims of the GPCCOP include: 1) To increase clinical research activities with new and established research bases; 2) To participate in chemoprevention studies supported through other NCI mechanisms, to enhance offerings to GPCCOP's population; 4) To maintain and enhance quality assurance and pharmacy tools to support GPCCOP accrual; 5) To provide for human subject protection and minimal research risk; and 6) To support the disease prevention objectives of ""Healthy People 2010"" - in particular, to eliminate health disparities among different segments of the population through outreach, affiliations, and recruitment strategies focusing on minorities, women, and the underserved. GPCCOP's organizational structure requires the involvement of the investigators, hospital administrators from each of the participating component organizations and the staff in planning and policy-making decisions. The research activities and resources are split evenly between the treatment segment and the chemoprevention segment of GPCCOP, with each segment achieving accrual and quality goals established by the National Cancer Institute. GPCCOP's outreach is focused on achieving goals of minority and underserved accrual through community affiliations, collaborations, and geographical diversity. By establishing community and tribal partnerships, GPCCOP facilitates an outreach territory encompassing more that 40,000 square miles and 4 counties. GPCCOP's dedication to participant accrual (205 treatment and more than 1000 chemoprevention participants in the past five years), quality assurance, human subject protection, and minority outreach, as well as the devotion of resources from its consortium hospitals, demonstrate its preparedness to continue its active participation in NCI's Community Clinical Oncology Program.

"Overcoming Barriers to Early Phase Clinical Trials - Th*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   Early phase I/II clinical trials are the primary clinical intellectual 'capital' of Cancer Centers in providing clear evidence of the translation of basic research findings from the laboratory to the bedside. At The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, 74% of all patients participating in therapeutic trials are registered on early phase trials. Nevertheless, barriers to the enrollment of patients on early phase trials hampers the evaluation of new agents and delays the adoption of new agents and regimens. We will address three barriers to the enrollment of patients on early phase trials: Barrier 1. The inability to conduct and document screening of patients for eligibility for enrollment on clinical trials in a comprehensive and efficient manner. To overcome the complexity of determining eligibility for any of our 130+ active phase I/II clinical trials we will develop and implement a computerized eligibility checking system integrated with our existing clinical trials SOL database using a rules-based application providing results to clinical trials staff using wireless tablet computers and wireless Palm devices. Barrier 2. The difficulty in enrolling patients from minority and underserved populations. To address the under- representation of minorities on early phase trials, we will develop educational programs addressing phase I/II trials to target minority physicians, minority nurses, and the urban community. These multimedia programs will focus on increasing awareness of recent innovations in early phase trials that replace guesswork and serendipity with rationally designed agents addressing molecular targets. Designated Minority Recruitment Coordinators will insure that all minority patients are screened for potential clinical trial participation. Barrier 3. The inability to provide full informed consent to patients unable to understand English, with limited English proficiency, illiterate, or visually impaired. The 21 million Americans who speak English ""less than well"" are often denied the opportunity to participate in clinical trials due to the inability to provide informed consent. This project incorporates: a] an educational program to train interpreters in clinical research, the protection of human subjects from research risks, and their role in this process; b] consent using an OPRR Short Form consent document; c] oral translation of the English language consent form; and d] videotaping the process with a copy being given to the patient for their reference.         ",Overcoming Barriers to Early Phase Clinical Trials - Th*,6666020,R21CA101726,"['health care service utilization ', ' health care service availability ', ' informed consent ', ' human subject ', ' nonEnglish language ', ' interview ', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology ', ' prejudice ', ' ethnic group ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' human data ', ' clinical trial phase I ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' clinical trial phase II ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2003,524315,0.027870519466294607
"Increasing EPCT Accrual Among Hispanics in South Texas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   Advances in cancer treatment are critically tied to the investigation of new therapeutic agents in early phase clinical trials. A significant barrier to progress has been the low participation rate onto these trials, especially among minority populations. Increasing minority accrual is critical to the development of novel cancer treatments. Without adequate minority participation in early phase clinical trials, researchers cannot assess differential effects among groups nor ensure the generalizability of trial results. The San Antonio Cancer Institute (SACI) is an NCT-designated Cancer Center located in South Texas that services a culturally and ethnically diverse population of largely Hispanics that historically has had a low participation rates onto early phase clinical trials. The goals of this project are to: 1) identify the cultural, economic, and structural barriers to early phase clinical trial participation faced by patients and oncologists; and 2) develop effective interventions to reduce these barriers, thereby increasing participation on drug development trials.   To achieve these goals, the following are the specific aims: 1) Identify the sociodemographic, cultural, economic, and structural patient barriers to participation in early phase clinical trials among cancer patients using qualitative methodology; 2) Identify and quantitate the magnitude of barriers to patient referral to early phase clinical trials through semi-structure qualitative interviews with oncologists in Bexar County, 3) Confirm these findings in a larger cancer patient population by quantitating the sociodemographic, cultural, economic, and structural barriers to participation; 4) Design an experimental intervention trial to reduce the barriers to early phase clinical trial participation; and 5) Conceptually evaluate that intervention among a representative group of cancer patients and oncologists. This proposed 2-year study will involve 200 Hispanic patients and 20 oncologists in the Bexar County, Texas. Both qualitative and quantitative formative research methods will be used to collect data to assess barriers. The results of these assessment activities will guide the design of a culturally sensitive intervention trial to overcome barriers encountered by both patients and oncologists when considering patient participation in an early phase clinical trial. The intervention protocol will be reviewed by patients and oncologists and finalized in preparation for a later phase of research (outside this 2-year project period) to be implemented and evaluated in the San Antonio area.

"Improving Cancer Outcomes for African-Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   Southeastern North Carolina is a rural area with concentrations of poverty and a large proportion of African-American residents. Within the nine-county service area of the New Hanover Health network are almost 170,000 African-American residents. African-Americans in North Carolina have higher mortality rates, compared with whites, for cancers of the uterine cervix, lung and bronchus, prostate, larynx, oral cavity and pharynx, breast, colon and rectum, and soft tissue. Participation by African-American cancer patients in federally sponsored radiation oncology group clinical trials has the potential to articulate more clearly the factors that contribute to these disparities.      Our goal is to increase accrual of African-American cancer patients to radiation therapy group clinical trials through the following: 1) Developing a collaborative partnership with an experienced academic institution that can provide continuing education, consultation, and training in the areas of radiation oncology treatment and research; 2) Identifying and addressing the local factors that inhibit participation in radiation clinical trials; and 3) Developing mechanisms to communicate with patients and providers in surrounding, rural areas to provide consultation and facilitate appropriate referrals for radiation trials.      We have developed three pilot studies (the response to the local factors aim, above) to address the following research questions: 1) How does the administration of amifostine during 3D conformal and intensity modulated radiation therapy for head and neck cancer interact with health habits and environmental factors in treatment completion, quality of life, and patient satisfaction with treatment; 2) How does multimodality therapy, including high-dose thoracic RT, chemotherapy, and ZD1839 as a potential radiosensitizer, for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer yield tolerance and quality of life outcomes that differ by race; 3) How do cognitive and psychosocial factors, namely, relationships with health care providers, religious beliefs, and predicted quality of life, influence the decision of prostate and breast cancer patients to seek, begin, and complete radiation treatment?

"UPMC McKeesport/ROCOG Radiation Oncology Minorities Out* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   A number of barriers, both real and perceived, tend to hinder the recruitment of patients, and by extension, minorities and poor people into clinical oncology trials at community centers. In order to initiate the opportunity to participate in clinical research at the community level, we have developed a collaborative regional network, The Radiation Oncology Community Outreach Group (ROCOG), based at UPMC McKeesport Hospital, that will build the infrastructure for clinical research at five community hospitals over the term of the grant, and which will deploy infrastructure resources for widespread, clinically and demographically disparate populations. Project goals include increasing clinical compliance, protocol recruitment and protocol retention within these populations, operationalizing a collaborative model of community based research, testing the efficacy of patient identification, engagement and outreach models and using a comprehensive outcomes measurement system to insure care quality and monitor treatment disparities. This proposal presents a number of other unique approaches and strengths. Several potential academic ""mentors"" have provided their endorsement, including the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Allegheny General Hospital Cancer Institute, Roswell Park Cancer Institute and the Mallincrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University at St. Louis. The proposal also has the support of several well-recognized minority health initiatives within western Pennsylvania, to assist us in outreach and disparities education. Our outreach strategies are tailored to urban or to rural areas, and include use of a new ""fast track"" patient identification function within Tumor Registry, Patient Navigator system, Protocol Nurse and contracted community outreach agencies. The proposed clinical pilots concerning breast conservation, colorectal and bone mets reflect locally-specific high burden of disease within minority populations. An integrated outcomes monitoring system using Tumor Registry & Record & Verify data is also proposed as a platform for a comprehensive CQI program. Finally, comprehensive patient and professional education will be provided through a combination of peer outreach, WEB-based programming and through a mobile application of the NCI Telesynergy system.

"Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Minority populations have multiple impediments to proper health care and this disparity is nowhere more meaningful than in cancer prevention and treatment. The overall cancer death rate for African-Americans is greater than for all other ethnic groups and the disparity, measured as the ratio of black:white cancer related mortality, has even worsened from 1979 to 1998 for both males and females. Considering these facts, it is clear that greater efforts are required for minority populations. This effort must include accrual to cancer therapy (CT) and cancer prevention and control (CPC) trials where minority populations are substantially underrepresented, even correcting for relative frequency to Caucasian populations. This proposal aims to establish a mechanism to accrue greater numbers of minority patients onto CT and CPC trials, to involve primary care health care centers in the minority community and to evaluate impediments for the overall process. The specific goals of this proposal are to broaden access to cancer treatment studies for minority populations by entering substantial numbers of minority patients onto NCI approved CT and CPC studies; to increase community practicing physician participation on NCI approved studies; and to transfer new technology to health care providers caring for minority and underserved populations. Additionally, the proposal will study barriers to CPC in minority populations and examine issues in MBCCOP performance for trials including recruitment, accrual and protocol performance. The Meharry Medical College (MMC) Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MBCCOP) is based on the dual mission of MMC to 1) educate minority physicians and 2) to treat minority and the underserved populations. MMC will serve as the centerpiece of the MBCCOP based on its active and increasing cancer treatment trials program in the catchment region of Metropolitan Davidson County (MDC) where minority populations make up approximately 33% of the entire population. The CT component of the MBCCOP will be the catchment areas largest multi-physician oncology practice (TN Oncology) already very active in clinical trials research. MBCCOP physicians will constitute 56% of all medical oncologists in the catchment area. These two groups care for large numbers of minority patients in MDC and both have a proven track record for placing patients on NCI approved protocols. MMC has a long and illustrious history in studying health care disparity and improving health care in the minority community. MMC and Vanderbilt University have extensive ongoing CT and CPC research that will serve as a foundation to expand accrual to other NCI approved trials of the research base(s). The CPC component will be an already established consortium of primary care health clinics that focus on minority and the underserved. This ""Safety-Net"" consortium is directed by a member of the MBCCOP and encourages research and health care delivery. This group of health care clinics, together with a novel and validated method to increase community participation in health care will be used to accrue patients onto CPC studies. The design of the MBCCOP, together with the components and established patient care methods, will allow for substantial numbers of patients to be entered onto CT and CPC studies of the NCI.

"Urban Latino African American Cancer Disparities Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   The Urban Latino-African American Cancer Disparity Project (ULAAC Disparities Project) links Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital (DFMH), a community hospital in service of a high need/low resource urban community (45% Latino, 45% African American) with major research institutions; University of Southern California and University of California San Francisco, and RAND to create a permanent clinical trials infrastructure. This collaboration generates an unprecedented opportunity to reduce disparities in access to radiation oncology, cancer prevention and translational research trials as well as demonstrate an intervention model with potential application to similar urban communities throughout the nation. The Project builds and stabilizes independent and collaborative clinical research capabilities of DFMH with its partners and improves ability to extend access to radiation oncology clinical research to African American and Latino persons with cancer and at high risk for cancer. The Project uses a cultural and language appropriate to the Health Educator to outreach to potential patients for Project-sponsored clinical and prevention trials, explain the benefits of trials participation, and identify and recruit trials participants. The Health Educator identifies potential Project patients through the 383 primary care physicians in the Project's target service community.  Outreach through primary care physicians builds on established patient and physician relationships that can, with Project interventions, overcome patient reticence and other barriers to clinical totals. The assignment of patients to Patient Navigators facilitates the care process by improving coordination of care functions that will in turn improve the quality of the medical interaction and increase enrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials. The Project demonstrates the use of a Health Educator and Patient Navigator-facilitated interventions to recruit and encourage African American and Latino persons with breast or prostate cancer or at high risk for these conditions to participate in and successfully complete radiation oncology clinical trials, a partial breast irradiation trial, cancer prevention trials and certain translational research investigations.

The continuing long-term goals and specific aims of the GPCCOP include: 1) To increase clinical research activities with new and established research bases; 2) To participate in chemoprevention studies supported through other NCI mechanisms, to enhance offerings to GPCCOP's population; 4) To maintain and enhance quality assurance and pharmacy tools to support GPCCOP accrual; 5) To provide for human subject protection and minimal research risk; and 6) To support the disease prevention objectives of ""Healthy People 2010"" - in particular, to eliminate health disparities among different segments of the population through outreach, affiliations, and recruitment strategies focusing on minorities, women, and the underserved. GPCCOP's organizational structure requires the involvement of the investigators, hospital administrators from each of the participating component organizations and the staff in planning and policy-making decisions. The research activities and resources are split evenly between the treatment segment and the chemoprevention segment of GPCCOP, with each segment achieving accrual and quality goals established by the National Cancer Institute. GPCCOP's outreach is focused on achieving goals of minority and underserved accrual through community affiliations, collaborations, and geographical diversity. By establishing community and tribal partnerships, GPCCOP facilitates an outreach territory encompassing more that 40,000 square miles and 4 counties. GPCCOP's dedication to participant accrual (205 treatment and more than 1000 chemoprevention participants in the past five years), quality assurance, human subject protection, and minority outreach, as well as the devotion of resources from its consortium hospitals, demonstrate its preparedness to continue its active participation in NCI's Community Clinical Oncology Program.

"MCG Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The Medical College of Georgia (MCG) Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MB-CCOP) proposal is designed to increase the availability of state-of-the-art treatment and cancer prevention and control research to minority individuals in their own communities. The establishment of an operational base for extending cancer clinical trials and cancer prevention and control trials in this part of Georgia is aimed to improve reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality in minority populations. The grant describes the organizational and operational plans which will provide the structure of the effective implementation of multidisciplinary research. African-Americans comprise 42% of newly diagnosed cancer patients at MCG. The adult and pediatric cancer clinical trial programs at MCG have been successful at enrolling minorities to clinical trials (40% of patients entered are African-Americans). African-Americans, in general, are disproportionately affected by disparities in the health care system. They are often unaware of available health services, distrust the system, and harbor fears regarding screening and prevention studies. Our affiliation with the National Black Leadership Initiative against Cancer (NBLIC) is intended to break that barrier which will potentially lead to improving accrual to cancer treatment and prevention trials. Currently we have affiliation with NSABP, ECOG, and COG, and we also have access to CTSU trials. This application proposes to continue the participation in these research bases and describes the working relationships with these cooperative groups and the methods used to enable MCG MB-CCOP to accrue significant numbers of minority patients to both treatment and cancer prevention and control clinical trials. To increase access to cancer prevention and control studies we are in the process of adding H. Lee Moffitt CCOP and NCCTG as additional research bases. MCG will use the MB-CCOP as an opportunity to consolidate and expand the cancer prevention and control trials. We have good track records of enrolling minorities (40 to 50%) to industry sponsored prevention studies and we will use the MB-CCOP as a venue to have access to NCI sponsored prevention studies. Funding of this MBCCOP program will insure increased access and accrual of minorities to clinical trials, and expand outreach to minority populations and the medically underserved in our region.

"Gulf Coast MBCCOP DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The purpose of this application is to provide continued access to NCI supported Cancer Treatment, Prevention and Control Trials for residents of the mid-gulf coast region. The MBCCOP in Mobile, AL is the only institution between New Orleans and Eastern Florida funded to provide these programs. The UAB in Birmingham AL is 260 miles distant. The MBCCOP in Mobile AL has existed and been funded since the inception of the program 12 years ago. The patient population in Mobile and environs is ideal for this type program because it is 35 percent African American and 2 percent other minorities. Further, about 60 percent of the population live in an urban environment and 40 percent in rural areas. This permitted the development of a MBCCOP at the University of South Alabama (USAMC) in 1990 and the development of affiliations with SWOG, NSABP, RTOG, MDA, URCC and POG (COG) with participation in Cancer Treatment, Prevention and Control Studies and development of local studies to determine reasons for differences in participation in trials by different ethnic groups. During 2000 the University indicated they were interested in pharmacological drug development and Phase I studies internally and with Pharmaceutical firms externally. The Mobile Infirmary Medical Center (MIMC) indicated an interest in the MBCCOP program and a Letter of Relinquishment of the program and grant was proffered by USAMC in favor of MIMC. Funding of MIMC for the remaining two years of the grant was provided by NCI following a site visit by DCP. The PI and CRA's at USAMC moved with the program to MIMC on 06/01/2001. The staff at MIMC had been a satellite of Tulane University for SWOG, RTOG and NSABP; this facilitated development of the MBCCOP at the new location. Most oncology patients at USA sought medical care at MIMC with closure of medical oncology at USA. Some were prohibited by third party payers.

Most of the transition is completed; Cancer Treatment and Prevention Trials are operational and Cancer Control protocols are being activated. Membership in NCCTG is sought to increase accrual to Cancer Control protocols. Adequacy of the new program is attested by passing five audits by national research bases during the first year of operation (RTOG, SWOG, ACOSOG, NSABP-Treatment, and NSABP-Prevention).

"Overcoming Barriers to Early Phase Clinical Trials - Th*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   Early phase I/II clinical trials are the primary clinical intellectual 'capital' of Cancer Centers in providing clear evidence of the translation of basic research findings from the laboratory to the bedside. At The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, 74% of all patients participating in therapeutic trials are registered on early phase trials. Nevertheless, barriers to the enrollment of patients on early phase trials hampers the evaluation of new agents and delays the adoption of new agents and regimens. We will address three barriers to the enrollment of patients on early phase trials: Barrier 1. The inability to conduct and document screening of patients for eligibility for enrollment on clinical trials in a comprehensive and efficient manner. To overcome the complexity of determining eligibility for any of our 130+ active phase I/II clinical trials we will develop and implement a computerized eligibility checking system integrated with our existing clinical trials SOL database using a rules-based application providing results to clinical trials staff using wireless tablet computers and wireless Palm devices. Barrier 2. The difficulty in enrolling patients from minority and underserved populations. To address the under- representation of minorities on early phase trials, we will develop educational programs addressing phase I/II trials to target minority physicians, minority nurses, and the urban community. These multimedia programs will focus on increasing awareness of recent innovations in early phase trials that replace guesswork and serendipity with rationally designed agents addressing molecular targets. Designated Minority Recruitment Coordinators will insure that all minority patients are screened for potential clinical trial participation. Barrier 3. The inability to provide full informed consent to patients unable to understand English, with limited English proficiency, illiterate, or visually impaired. The 21 million Americans who speak English ""less than well"" are often denied the opportunity to participate in clinical trials due to the inability to provide informed consent. This project incorporates: a] an educational program to train interpreters in clinical research, the protection of human subjects from research risks, and their role in this process; b] consent using an OPRR Short Form consent document; c] oral translation of the English language consent form; and d] videotaping the process with a copy being given to the patient for their reference.         ",Overcoming Barriers to Early Phase Clinical Trials - Th*,6791281,R21CA101726,"['health care service utilization ', ' health care service availability ', ' informed consent ', ' human subject ', ' nonEnglish language ', ' interview ', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology ', ' prejudice ', ' ethnic group ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' human data ', ' clinical trial phase I ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' clinical trial phase II ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2004,529416,0.027870519466294607

"Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Minority populations have multiple impediments to proper health care and this disparity is nowhere more meaningful than in cancer prevention and treatment. The overall cancer death rate for African-Americans is greater than for all other ethnic groups and the disparity, measured as the ratio of black:white cancer related mortality, has even worsened from 1979 to 1998 for both males and females. Considering these facts, it is clear that greater efforts are required for minority populations. This effort must include accrual to cancer therapy (CT) and cancer prevention and control (CPC) trials where minority populations are substantially underrepresented, even correcting for relative frequency to Caucasian populations. This proposal aims to establish a mechanism to accrue greater numbers of minority patients onto CT and CPC trials, to involve primary care health care centers in the minority community and to evaluate impediments for the overall process. The specific goals of this proposal are to broaden access to cancer treatment studies for minority populations by entering substantial numbers of minority patients onto NCI approved CT and CPC studies; to increase community practicing physician participation on NCI approved studies; and to transfer new technology to health care providers caring for minority and underserved populations. Additionally, the proposal will study barriers to CPC in minority populations and examine issues in MBCCOP performance for trials including recruitment, accrual and protocol performance. The Meharry Medical College (MMC) Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MBCCOP) is based on the dual mission of MMC to 1) educate minority physicians and 2) to treat minority and the underserved populations. MMC will serve as the centerpiece of the MBCCOP based on its active and increasing cancer treatment trials program in the catchment region of Metropolitan Davidson County (MDC) where minority populations make up approximately 33% of the entire population. The CT component of the MBCCOP will be the catchment areas largest multi-physician oncology practice (TN Oncology) already very active in clinical trials research. MBCCOP physicians will constitute 56% of all medical oncologists in the catchment area. These two groups care for large numbers of minority patients in MDC and both have a proven track record for placing patients on NCI approved protocols. MMC has a long and illustrious history in studying health care disparity and improving health care in the minority community. MMC and Vanderbilt University have extensive ongoing CT and CPC research that will serve as a foundation to expand accrual to other NCI approved trials of the research base(s). The CPC component will be an already established consortium of primary care health clinics that focus on minority and the underserved. This ""Safety-Net"" consortium is directed by a member of the MBCCOP and encourages research and health care delivery. This group of health care clinics, together with a novel and validated method to increase community participation in health care will be used to accrue patients onto CPC studies. The design of the MBCCOP, together with the components and established patient care methods, will allow for substantial numbers of patients to be entered onto CT and CPC studies of the NCI.

"MS/AL Radiation Oncology Research Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   The Mississippi/Alabama Radiation Oncology Research Partnership is formed to establish and sustain a radiation oncology research program that will address cancer disparities among African Americans and underserved populations in the Mississippi region. The potential partners include the Regional Cancer Center (RCC) at Singing River Hospital System (SRHS) in Pascagoula, Mississippi, the University of Alabama Comprehensive Cancer Center (UABCCC) in Birmingham, Alabama, and the Gulf Coast Minority-Based Cooperative Clinical Oncology Program (MBCCOP). The overall goal of the proposed partnership is to improve access and accrual of cancer clinical trials for African American and historically underserved populations. Clinical trials are the principal tools for achieving and demonstrating progress in cancer treatment and prevention. Unfortunately, the level of accrual of African Americans and underserved populations in clinical trials is disproportionate to the disease burden. In addition, many health care institutions that provide care to a disproportionate number of these populations are not often linked to the national cancer research protocols. As a result, radiation oncologists in these institutions have a difficult time starting, developing, and sustaining research programs. Thus, this proposed partnership seeks funding to support the planning, development, and implementation of a radiation oncology clinical trials program. Three pilot clinical trials research projects will be conducted as part of implementation of the research program to address patient accrual. Project #1 is the ""Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer."" Project #2 is ""Phase II study of Gamma Knife Radiosurgery and Temozolomide (Temodar) for Newly Diagnosed Brain Metastases."" Project #3 is ""Evaluation of Prostate Screening Outcomes in African American Men."" The proposed research plan will enable investigators to examine whether increasing access to cancer clinical research trials will increase accrual and participation.

"Urban Latino African American Cancer Disparities Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   The Urban Latino-African American Cancer Disparity Project (ULAAC Disparities Project) links Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital (DFMH), a community hospital in service of a high need/low resource urban community (45% Latino, 45% African American) with major research institutions; University of Southern California and University of California San Francisco, and RAND to create a permanent clinical trials infrastructure. This collaboration generates an unprecedented opportunity to reduce disparities in access to radiation oncology, cancer prevention and translational research trials as well as demonstrate an intervention model with potential application to similar urban communities throughout the nation. The Project builds and stabilizes independent and collaborative clinical research capabilities of DFMH with its partners and improves ability to extend access to radiation oncology clinical research to African American and Latino persons with cancer and at high risk for cancer. The Project uses a cultural and language appropriate to the Health Educator to outreach to potential patients for Project-sponsored clinical and prevention trials, explain the benefits of trials participation, and identify and recruit trials participants. The Health Educator identifies potential Project patients through the 383 primary care physicians in the Project's target service community.  Outreach through primary care physicians builds on established patient and physician relationships that can, with Project interventions, overcome patient reticence and other barriers to clinical totals. The assignment of patients to Patient Navigators facilitates the care process by improving coordination of care functions that will in turn improve the quality of the medical interaction and increase enrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials. The Project demonstrates the use of a Health Educator and Patient Navigator-facilitated interventions to recruit and encourage African American and Latino persons with breast or prostate cancer or at high risk for these conditions to participate in and successfully complete radiation oncology clinical trials, a partial breast irradiation trial, cancer prevention trials and certain translational research investigations.

"Improving Cancer Outcomes for African-Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   Southeastern North Carolina is a rural area with concentrations of poverty and a large proportion of African-American residents. Within the nine-county service area of the New Hanover Health network are almost 170,000 African-American residents. African-Americans in North Carolina have higher mortality rates, compared with whites, for cancers of the uterine cervix, lung and bronchus, prostate, larynx, oral cavity and pharynx, breast, colon and rectum, and soft tissue. Participation by African-American cancer patients in federally sponsored radiation oncology group clinical trials has the potential to articulate more clearly the factors that contribute to these disparities.      Our goal is to increase accrual of African-American cancer patients to radiation therapy group clinical trials through the following: 1) Developing a collaborative partnership with an experienced academic institution that can provide continuing education, consultation, and training in the areas of radiation oncology treatment and research; 2) Identifying and addressing the local factors that inhibit participation in radiation clinical trials; and 3) Developing mechanisms to communicate with patients and providers in surrounding, rural areas to provide consultation and facilitate appropriate referrals for radiation trials.      We have developed three pilot studies (the response to the local factors aim, above) to address the following research questions: 1) How does the administration of amifostine during 3D conformal and intensity modulated radiation therapy for head and neck cancer interact with health habits and environmental factors in treatment completion, quality of life, and patient satisfaction with treatment; 2) How does multimodality therapy, including high-dose thoracic RT, chemotherapy, and ZD1839 as a potential radiosensitizer, for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer yield tolerance and quality of life outcomes that differ by race; 3) How do cognitive and psychosocial factors, namely, relationships with health care providers, religious beliefs, and predicted quality of life, influence the decision of prostate and breast cancer patients to seek, begin, and complete radiation treatment?

"MS/AL Radiation Oncology Research Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   The Mississippi/Alabama Radiation Oncology Research Partnership is formed to establish and sustain a radiation oncology research program that will address cancer disparities among African Americans and underserved populations in the Mississippi region. The potential partners include the Regional Cancer Center (RCC) at Singing River Hospital System (SRHS) in Pascagoula, Mississippi, the University of Alabama Comprehensive Cancer Center (UABCCC) in Birmingham, Alabama, and the Gulf Coast Minority-Based Cooperative Clinical Oncology Program (MBCCOP). The overall goal of the proposed partnership is to improve access and accrual of cancer clinical trials for African American and historically underserved populations. Clinical trials are the principal tools for achieving and demonstrating progress in cancer treatment and prevention. Unfortunately, the level of accrual of African Americans and underserved populations in clinical trials is disproportionate to the disease burden. In addition, many health care institutions that provide care to a disproportionate number of these populations are not often linked to the national cancer research protocols. As a result, radiation oncologists in these institutions have a difficult time starting, developing, and sustaining research programs. Thus, this proposed partnership seeks funding to support the planning, development, and implementation of a radiation oncology clinical trials program.

"Urban Latino African American Cancer Disparities Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   The Urban Latino-African American Cancer Disparity Project (ULAAC Disparities Project) links Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital (DFMH), a community hospital in service of a high need/low resource urban community (45% Latino, 45% African American) with major research institutions; University of Southern California and University of California San Francisco, and RAND to create a permanent clinical trials infrastructure. This collaboration generates an unprecedented opportunity to reduce disparities in access to radiation oncology, cancer prevention and translational research trials as well as demonstrate an intervention model with potential application to similar urban communities throughout the nation. The Project builds and stabilizes independent and collaborative clinical research capabilities of DFMH with its partners and improves ability to extend access to radiation oncology clinical research to African American and Latino persons with cancer and at high risk for cancer. The Project uses a cultural and language appropriate to the Health Educator to outreach to potential patients for Project-sponsored clinical and prevention trials, explain the benefits of trials participation, and identify and recruit trials participants. The Health Educator identifies potential Project patients through the 383 primary care physicians in the Project's target service community.  Outreach through primary care physicians builds on established patient and physician relationships that can, with Project interventions, overcome patient reticence and other barriers to clinical totals. The assignment of patients to Patient Navigators facilitates the care process by improving coordination of care functions that will in turn improve the quality of the medical interaction and increase enrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials. The Project demonstrates the use of a Health Educator and Patient Navigator-facilitated interventions to recruit and encourage African American and Latino persons with breast or prostate cancer or at high risk for these conditions to participate in and successfully complete radiation oncology clinical trials, a partial breast irradiation trial, cancer prevention trials and certain translational research investigations. A crucial Project component is systematic evaluation. The evaluation assesses the needs and concerns of stakeholders and provides ongoing feedback and suggests alternative approaches.

"Improving Cancer Outcomes for African-Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   Southeastern North Carolina is a rural area with concentrations of poverty and a large proportion of African-American residents. Within the nine-county service area of the New Hanover Health network are almost 170,000 African-American residents. African-Americans in North Carolina have higher mortality rates, compared with whites, for cancers of the uterine cervix, lung and bronchus, prostate, larynx, oral cavity and pharynx, breast, colon and rectum, and soft tissue. Participation by African-American cancer patients in federally sponsored radiation oncology group clinical trials has the potential to articulate more clearly the factors that contribute to these disparities.      Our goal is to increase accrual of African-American cancer patients to radiation therapy group clinical trials through the following: 1) Developing a collaborative partnership with an experienced academic institution that can provide continuing education, consultation, and training in the areas of radiation oncology treatment and research; 2) Identifying and addressing the local factors that inhibit participation in radiation clinical trials; and 3) Developing mechanisms to communicate with patients and providers in surrounding, rural areas to provide consultation and facilitate appropriate referrals for radiation trials.      We have developed three pilot studies (the response to the local factors aim, above) to address the following research questions: 1) How does the administration of amifostine during 3D conformal and intensity modulated radiation therapy for head and neck cancer interact with health habits and environmental factors in treatment completion, quality of life, and patient satisfaction with treatment; 2) How does multimodality therapy, including high-dose thoracic RT, chemotherapy, and ZD1839 as a potential radiosensitizer, for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer yield tolerance and quality of life outcomes that differ by race; 3) How do cognitive and psychosocial factors, namely, relationships with health care providers, religious beliefs, and predicted quality of life, influence the decision of prostate and breast cancer patients to seek, begin, and complete radiation treatment?      This project will permit us to contribute to the advancement of medical knowledge and medical practice that will eventually lead to the reduction or elimination of racial disparities in cancer outcomes.

"Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Minority populations have multiple impediments to proper health care and this disparity is nowhere more meaningful than in cancer prevention and treatment. The overall cancer death rate for African-Americans is greater than for all other ethnic groups and the disparity, measured as the ratio of black:white cancer related mortality, has even worsened from 1979 to 1998 for both males and females. Considering these facts, it is clear that greater efforts are required for minority populations. This effort must include accrual to cancer therapy (CT) and cancer prevention and control (CPC) trials where minority populations are substantially underrepresented, even correcting for relative frequency to Caucasian populations. This proposal aims to establish a mechanism to accrue greater numbers of minority patients onto CT and CPC trials, to involve primary care health care centers in the minority community and to evaluate impediments for the overall process. The specific goals of this proposal are to broaden access to cancer treatment studies for minority populations by entering substantial numbers of minority patients onto NCI approved CT and CPC studies; to increase community practicing physician participation on NCI approved studies; and to transfer new technology to health care providers caring for minority and underserved populations. Additionally, the proposal will study barriers to CPC in minority populations and examine issues in MBCCOP performance for trials including recruitment, accrual and protocol performance. The Meharry Medical College (MMC) Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MBCCOP) is based on the dual mission of MMC to 1) educate minority physicians and 2) to treat minority and the underserved populations. MMC will serve as the centerpiece of the MBCCOP based on its active and increasing cancer treatment trials program in the catchment region of Metropolitan Davidson County (MDC) where minority populations make up approximately 33% of the entire population. The CT component of the MBCCOP will be the catchment areas largest multi-physician oncology practice (TN Oncology) already very active in clinical trials research. MBCCOP physicians will constitute 56% of all medical oncologists in the catchment area. These two groups care for large numbers of minority patients in MDC and both have a proven track record for placing patients on NCI approved protocols. MMC has a long and illustrious history in studying health care disparity and improving health care in the minority community. MMC and Vanderbilt University have extensive ongoing CT and CPC research that will serve as a foundation to expand accrual to other NCI approved trials of the research base(s). The CPC component will be an already established consortium of primary care health clinics that focus on minority and the underserved. This ""Safety-Net"" consortium is directed by a member of the MBCCOP and encourages research and health care delivery. This group of health care clinics, together with a novel and validated method to increase community participation in health care will be used to accrue patients onto CPC studies. The design of the MBCCOP, together with the components and established patient care methods, will allow for substantial numbers of patients to be entered onto CT and CPC studies of the NCI.

"Gulf Coast MBCCOP DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The purpose of this application is to provide continued access to NCI supported Cancer Treatment, Prevention and Control Trials for residents of the mid-gulf coast region. The MBCCOP in Mobile, AL is the only institution between New Orleans and Eastern Florida funded to provide these programs. The UAB in Birmingham AL is 260 miles distant. The MBCCOP in Mobile AL has existed and been funded since the inception of the program 12 years ago. The patient population in Mobile and environs is ideal for this type program because it is 35 percent African American and 2 percent other minorities. Further, about 60 percent of the population live in an urban environment and 40 percent in rural areas. This permitted the development of a MBCCOP at the University of South Alabama (USAMC) in 1990 and the development of affiliations with SWOG, NSABP, RTOG, MDA, URCC and POG (COG) with participation in Cancer Treatment, Prevention and Control Studies and development of local studies to determine reasons for differences in participation in trials by different ethnic groups. During 2000 the University indicated they were interested in pharmacological drug development and Phase I studies internally and with Pharmaceutical firms externally. The Mobile Infirmary Medical Center (MIMC) indicated an interest in the MBCCOP program and a Letter of Relinquishment of the program and grant was proffered by USAMC in favor of MIMC. Funding of MIMC for the remaining two years of the grant was provided by NCI following a site visit by DCP. The PI and CRA's at USAMC moved with the program to MIMC on 06/01/2001. The staff at MIMC had been a satellite of Tulane University for SWOG, RTOG and NSABP; this facilitated development of the MBCCOP at the new location. Most oncology patients at USA sought medical care at MIMC with closure of medical oncology at USA. Some were prohibited by third party payers. Followup is being accomplished by telephone and help of community physicians. All medical records were reproduced with individual patient permission. IRB approval of all protocols was necessary at MIMC and this slowed accrual because of inability of the IRB to review adequately 88 protocols abruptly. Most of the transition is completed; Cancer Treatment and Prevention Trials are operational and Cancer Control protocols are being activated. Membership in NCCTG is sought to increase accrual to Cancer Control protocols. Adequacy of the new program is attested by passing five audits by national research bases during the first year of operation (RTOG, SWOG, ACOSOG, NSABP-Treatment, and NSABP-Prevention). Genesis of the MBCCOP at MIMC was associated with increased accrual to NCI supported research over previous years.

"Urban Latino African American Cancer Disparities Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   The Urban Latino-African American Cancer Disparity Project (ULAAC Disparities Project) links Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital (DFMH), a community hospital in service of a high need/low resource urban community (45% Latino, 45% African American) with major research institutions; University of Southern California and University of California San Francisco, and RAND to create a permanent clinical trials infrastructure. This collaboration generates an unprecedented opportunity to reduce disparities in access to radiation oncology, cancer prevention and translational research trials as well as demonstrate an intervention model with potential application to similar urban communities throughout the nation. The Project builds and stabilizes independent and collaborative clinical research capabilities of DFMH with its partners and improves ability to extend access to radiation oncology clinical research to African American and Latino persons with cancer and at high risk for cancer. The Project uses a cultural and language appropriate to the Health Educator to outreach to potential patients for Project-sponsored clinical and prevention trials, explain the benefits of trials participation, and identify and recruit trials participants. The Health Educator identifies potential Project patients through the 383 primary care physicians in the Project's target service community.  Outreach through primary care physicians builds on established patient and physician relationships that can, with Project interventions, overcome patient reticence and other barriers to clinical totals. The assignment of patients to Patient Navigators facilitates the care process by improving coordination of care functions that will in turn improve the quality of the medical interaction and increase enrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials. The Project demonstrates the use of a Health Educator and Patient Navigator-facilitated interventions to recruit and encourage African American and Latino persons with breast or prostate cancer or at high risk for these conditions to participate in and successfully complete radiation oncology clinical trials, a partial breast irradiation trial, cancer prevention trials and certain translational research investigations. A crucial Project component is systematic evaluation. The evaluation assesses the needs and concerns of stakeholders and provides ongoing feedback and suggests alternative approaches.

"Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program at Meharry Medical College    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minority populations have multiple impediments to proper health care. This disparity is particularly noted for cancer where African-Americans have an overall cancer death rate that is greater than for all other ethnic groups. Furthermore, the ratio of black:white cancer related mortality continues to worsen for both males and females. Considering these facts, it is clear that meaningful efforts for cancer care is required for minority populations. One focus of this effort is the necessity to increase minority and underserved patient accrual to cancer therapy (CT) and cancer prevention and control (CP/C) trials where minority populations are substantially underrepresented, even correcting for their relative frequency to Caucasian populations. This proposal continues the successful initial accomplishments of the MBCCOP at Meharry Medical College (MMC) that established and sustained a mechanism to bring state-of-the-art cancer clinical trials to minority populations and to involve community practicing physicians in NCI-sponsored clinical trials. This application will continue and enhance the specific aims that are to 1) broaden access to cancer treatment by entering substantial numbers of minority patients onto NCI approved CT and CP/C studies, 2) involve communities and community health centers in cancer trials and investigate their impact on community medical practices, 3) increase community practicing physician participation on NCI approved studies and 4) transfer new technology to health care providers caring for minority and underserved populations. MMC, with greater than 40% of newly diagnosed cancer patients representing minorities, will serve as the central core supported by its active cancer research and treatment trials program. The catchment region will be Metropolitan Davidson County (MDC) where minority populations make up approximately 33% of the entire population. The CT affiliate components of the MBCCOP will continue to include the areas largest multi- physician oncology practice (Sara Cannon Research Institute/Tennessee Oncology) and the sole minority directed hematology/oncology practice in MDC, Nashville Oncology Associates. Together, these groups care for large numbers of minority patients and have proven successful in placing substantial numbers of patients on NCI approved protocols. The CP/C program will continue to use an established consortium of primary care health clinics that focus on minorities and the underserved as well as accruing to CT studies that have CP/C components. The community health centers are particularly well-suited to perform CP/C studies requiring non-cancer patients such as breast cancer prevention trials. The overall design of the MBCCOP with its established infrastructure together with affiliates and well-defined clinical trial methods will continue to accrue substantial numbers of patients onto NCI approved CT and CP/C studies.           ",Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program at Meharry Medical College,7282633,U10CA107612,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Population Group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Breast Cancer Prevention Trial ', ' Data ', ' Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project ', ' NSABP ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Death Rates ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Community Practice ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Rate ', ' Community Health ', ' Female ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Hematology ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Numbers ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Funding ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Tennessee ', ' Time ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' data management ', ' metropolitan ', ' Breast ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Specialist ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' treatment trial ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer type ', ' health practice ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NCI,MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE,U10,2007,380359,0.10613943565436815

"Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program at Meharry Medical College Minority populations have multiple impediments to proper health care. This disparity is particularly noted for cancer where African-Americans have an overall cancer death rate that is greater than for all other ethnic groups. Furthermore, the ratio of black:white cancer related mortality continues to worsen for both males and females. Considering these facts, it is clear that meaningful efforts for cancer care is required for minority populations. One focus of this effort is the necessity to increase minority and underserved patient accrual to cancer therapy (CT) and cancer prevention and control (CP/C) trials where minority populations are substantially underrepresented, even correcting for their relative frequency to Caucasian populations. This proposal continues the successful initial accomplishments of the MBCCOP at Meharry Medical College (MMC) that established and sustained a mechanism to bring state-of-the-art cancer clinical trials to minority populations and to involve community practicing physicians in NCI-sponsored clinical trials. This application will continue and enhance the specific aims that are to 1) broaden access to cancer treatment by entering substantial numbers of minority patients onto NCI approved CT and CP/C studies, 2) involve communities and community health centers in cancer trials and investigate their impact on community medical practices, 3) increase community practicing physician participation on NCI approved studies and 4) transfer new technology to health care providers caring for minority and underserved populations. MMC, with greater than 40% of newly diagnosed cancer patients representing minorities, will serve as the central core supported by its active cancer research and treatment trials program. The catchment region will be Metropolitan Davidson County (MDC) where minority populations make up approximately 33% of the entire population. The CT affiliate components of the MBCCOP will continue to include the areas largest multi- physician oncology practice (Sara Cannon Research Institute/Tennessee Oncology) and the sole minority directed hematology/oncology practice in MDC,Nashville Oncology Associates. Together, these groups care for large numbers of minority patients and have proven successful in placing substantial numbers of patients on NCI approved protocols. The CP/C program will continue to use an established consortium of primary care health clinics that focus on minorities and the underserved as well as accruing to CT studies that have CP/Ccomponents. The community health centers are particularly well-suited to performCP/C studies requiring non-cancer patients such as breast cancer prevention trials. The overall design of the MBCCOP with its established infrastructure together with affiliates and well-defined clinical trial methods will continue to accrue substantial numbers of patients onto NCI approved CT and CP/C studies.

"MS/AL Radiation Oncology Research Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   The Mississippi/Alabama Radiation Oncology Research Partnership is formed to establish and sustain a radiation oncology research program that will address cancer disparities among African Americans and underserved populations in the Mississippi region. The potential partners include the Regional Cancer Center (RCC) at Singing River Hospital System (SRHS) in Pascagoula, Mississippi, the University of Alabama Comprehensive Cancer Center (UABCCC) in Birmingham, Alabama, and the Gulf Coast Minority-Based Cooperative Clinical Oncology Program (MBCCOP). The overall goal of the proposed partnership is to improve access and accrual of cancer clinical trials for African American and historically underserved populations. Clinical trials are the principal tools for achieving and demonstrating progress in cancer treatment and prevention. Unfortunately, the level of accrual of African Americans and underserved populations in clinical trials is disproportionate to the disease burden. In addition, many health care institutions that provide care to a disproportionate number of these populations are not often linked to the national cancer research protocols. As a result, radiation oncologists in these institutions have a difficult time starting, developing, and sustaining research programs. Thus, this proposed partnership seeks funding to support the planning, development, and implementation of a radiation oncology clinical trials program. Three pilot clinical trials research projects will be conducted as part of implementation of the research program to address patient accrual. Project #1 is the ""Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer."" Project #2 is ""Phase II study of Gamma Knife Radiosurgery and Temozolomide (Temodar) for Newly Diagnosed Brain Metastases."" Project #3 is ""Evaluation of Prostate Screening Outcomes in African American Men."" The proposed research plan will enable investigators to examine whether increasing access to cancer clinical research trials will increase accrual and participation. The partnership collaboration will serve as the major vehicle for building a research infrastructure and generating new findings in radiation oncology that may impact cancer disparities in African American and underserved populations.

"Urban Latino African American Cancer Disparities Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   The Urban Latino-African American Cancer Disparity Project (ULAAC Disparities Project) links Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital (DFMH), a community hospital in service of a high need/low resource urban community (45% Latino, 45% African American) with major research institutions; University of Southern California and University of California San Francisco, and RAND to create a permanent clinical trials infrastructure. This collaboration generates an unprecedented opportunity to reduce disparities in access to radiation oncology, cancer prevention and translational research trials as well as demonstrate an intervention model with potential application to similar urban communities throughout the nation. The Project builds and stabilizes independent and collaborative clinical research capabilities of DFMH with its partners and improves ability to extend access to radiation oncology clinical research to African American and Latino persons with cancer and at high risk for cancer. The Project uses a cultural and language appropriate to the Health Educator to outreach to potential patients for Project-sponsored clinical and prevention trials, explain the benefits of trials participation, and identify and recruit trials participants. The Health Educator identifies potential Project patients through the 383 primary care physicians in the Project's target service community.  Outreach through primary care physicians builds on established patient and physician relationships that can, with Project interventions, overcome patient reticence and other barriers to clinical totals. The assignment of patients to Patient Navigators facilitates the care process by improving coordination of care functions that will in turn improve the quality of the medical interaction and increase enrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials. The Project demonstrates the use of a Health Educator and Patient Navigator-facilitated interventions to recruit and encourage African American and Latino persons with breast or prostate cancer or at high risk for these conditions to participate in and successfully complete radiation oncology clinical trials, a partial breast irradiation trial, cancer prevention trials and certain translational research investigations. A crucial Project component is systematic evaluation. The evaluation assesses the needs and concerns of stakeholders and provides ongoing feedback and suggests alternative approaches.

"An Exploration of Perceived Racial/Ethnic Discrimination in Cancer Care Delivery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The elimination of cancer health disparities among minorities is a priority goal for Healthy People 2010 and the NCI. System-level healthcare discrimination and healthcare provider bias has received increased focus as possible contributory factors to overall health disparities and has prompted a call from NIH to further investigate the effects of racial/ethnic discrimination in healthcare. Little is known about racial/ethnic discrimination in cancer care delivery, particularly from perspectives of minority patients. The Aims of this R-03 exploratory proposal are (1) to investigate African American (AA) and Mexican American (MA) breast cancer patients perceptions of cancer care delivery, specifically perceived discrimination and (2) to analyze how ethnic/cultural group identification and Spanish-language preference affect perceptions of and experiences with cancer care delivery. A sequential triangulated qualitative design will be used to provide in-depth understanding of sociodemographic and ethnocultural aspects of cancer care from the perspectives of two minority groups. The total sample (N= 60 women) will include 20 AA patients, 20 MA predominately English- speaking patients, and 20 MA predominantly Spanish-speaking patients, diagnosed with breast cancer in the past 3 years, to explore issues related to potential language barriers and perceived racial/ethnic bias in breast cancer care delivery. These minority groups are chosen for study because of their history of discrimination in other contexts and because of their significant cancer disparities. For Aim 1, semi-structured interviews will be done with patients to analyze their perceptions and experiences of cancer care delivery using matrix analyses. For Aim 2, we will analyze how ethnic/cultural group identification affect perceptions of cancer care delivery and how these perceptions influence patients' healthcare utilization, treatment adherence, and willingness to remain engaged in continuous cancer care. Findings from this study will increase understanding of how ethnocultural factors affect minority patient experiences of cancer care and potential health-related consequences of perceived discrimination. The proposed study is a first step in a program of research to develop and test culturally responsive, evidence-based nursing and behavioral medical interventions to reduce cancer disparities among minority populations. This research project has the potential to improve the public health of minority cancer patients in the United States by highlighting perceived barriers in healthcare delivery systems. An in-depth understanding of how cultural factors affect patients' interactions with cancer physicians and other health care staff will help us to develop strategies to improve health care communication and cancer care delivery to minority populations.          ",An Exploration of Perceived Racial/Ethnic Discrimination in Cancer Care Delivery,7305435,R03CA124752,"['Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Range ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Depth ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Indium ', ' In element ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Structure ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Group Identifications ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Sampling ', ' ethnic discrimination ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer care ', ' Communication ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Conceptions ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ']",NCI,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R03,2007,77034,0.010526016356124858

"UPMC McKeesport/ROCOG Radiation Oncology Minorities Out* A number of barriers, both real and perceived, tend to hinder the recruitment of patients, and by extension, minorities and poor people into clinical oncology trials at community centers. In order to initiate the opportunity to participate in clinical research at the community level, we have developed a collaborative regional network, The Radiation Oncology Community Outreach Group (ROCOG), based at UPMC McKeesport Hospital, that will build the infrastructure for clinical research at five community hospitals over the term of the grant, and which will deploy infrastructure resources for widespread, clinically and demographically disparate populations. Project goals include increasing clinical compliance, protocol recruitment and protocol retention within these populations, operationalizing a collaborative model of community- based research, testing the efficacy of patient identification, engagement and outreach models and using a comprehensive outcomes measurement system to insure care quality and monitor treatment disparities. This proposal presents a number of other unique approaches and strengths. Several potential academic ""mentors"" have provided their endorsement, including the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Allegheny General Hospital Cancer  Institute, Roswell Park Cancer Institute and the Mallincrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University at St. Louis. The proposal also has the support of several well-recognized minority health initiatives within western Pennsylvania, to  assist us in outreach and disparities education. Our outreach strategies are tailored to urban or to rural areas, and include  use of a new ""fast track"" patient identification function within Tumor Registry, Patient Navigator system, Protocol Nurse and  contracted community outreach agencies. The proposed clinical pilots concerning breast conservation, colorectal and bone  mets reflect locally-specific high burden of disease within minority populations. An integrated outcomes monitoring system  using Tumor Registry & Record & Verify data is also proposed as a platform for a comprehensive CQI program. Finally,  comprehensive patient and professional education will be provided through a combination of peer outreach, WEB-based  }rogramming and through a mobile application of the NCI Telesynergy system.

"Improving Cancer Outcomes for African-Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   Southeastern North Carolina is a rural area with concentrations of poverty and a large proportion of African-American residents. Within the nine-county service area of the New Hanover Health network are almost 170,000 African-American residents. African-Americans in North Carolina have higher mortality rates, compared with whites, for cancers of the uterine cervix, lung and bronchus, prostate, larynx, oral cavity and pharynx, breast, colon and rectum, and soft tissue. Participation by African-American cancer patients in federally sponsored radiation oncology group clinical trials has the potential to articulate more clearly the factors that contribute to these disparities.      Our goal is to increase accrual of African-American cancer patients to radiation therapy group clinical trials through the following: 1) Developing a collaborative partnership with an experienced academic institution that can provide continuing education, consultation, and training in the areas of radiation oncology treatment and research; 2) Identifying and addressing the local factors that inhibit participation in radiation clinical trials; and 3) Developing mechanisms to communicate with patients and providers in surrounding, rural areas to provide consultation and facilitate appropriate referrals for radiation trials.      We have developed three pilot studies (the response to the local factors aim, above) to address the following research questions: 1) How does the administration of amifostine during 3D conformal and intensity modulated radiation therapy for head and neck cancer interact with health habits and environmental factors in treatment completion, quality of life, and patient satisfaction with treatment; 2) How does multimodality therapy, including high-dose thoracic RT, chemotherapy, and ZD1839 as a potential radiosensitizer, for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer yield tolerance and quality of life outcomes that differ by race; 3) How do cognitive and psychosocial factors, namely, relationships with health care providers, religious beliefs, and predicted quality of life, influence the decision of prostate and breast cancer patients to seek, begin, and complete radiation treatment?      This project will permit us to contribute to the advancement of medical knowledge and medical practice that will eventually lead to the reduction or elimination of racial disparities in cancer outcomes.

"PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY EDUCATION    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pediatric cancer is the leading cause of death in childhood from medical conditions in the US. Thus pediatric cancer education is important for pediatricians and family medicine physicians, so that it can be diagnosed early, when it is most curable. The Pediatric Oncology Education (POE) program provides knowledge and experience to enable promising students to consider careers in cancer research, clinical practice, and related areas. Particular attention is given to including students from groups that are under-represented among oncology scientists and clinicians. POE program participants are outstanding pre-doctoral biomedical science students and health professions (medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, nursing) students interested in careers in oncology or pediatrics.       All participants are US citizens or permanent residents. Their tenure is a minimum of 11 weeks (9 weeks for medical students; 10 weeks for returning students). Students are matched with a St. Jude faculty mentor with similar research interests. They participate in the mentor's ongoing research program. They attend ongoing institutional clinical and basic research conferences, as well as a Lunch & Learn seminar series designed specifically for them. They give a PowerPoint presentation on their research project in the Lunch & Learn series. They submit a report on their research project written in the style of a journal in which their mentor publishes.       Ongoing assessment and evaluation of the program is provided by pre- and post-experience testing of the student's knowledge of pediatric cancer and related areas, post-experience surveys completed by the student and by the mentor, and overall program evaluation by the program advisory group. An experienced R25E investigator from a prominent cancer center will review the program as a consultant in 2005. Many participants (27% in 2001-2004) return for an additional appointment, thus reinforcing their cancer education and biomedical research experience. 1995-2003 program participants are authors on 119 peer-reviewed publications to date. A long-term tracking process is in place. Of former program participants who have now finished their academic degree work, 88% have a doctorate, including 80% of the under-represented minority participants.       The program is advertised by word of mouth, our web site, and announcements mailed to all US medical schools and to all historically minority colleges and universities. Approximately 400 students apply for the program each year. The 2004 acceptance rate was 13.9%, and the class average gpa was 3.75. One-third of 1995-2004 participants were under-represented minority students, and nearly two-thirds were women.

"New Mexico Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program    Description (provided by applicant):   With the highest proportion of Hispanics and American Indians of any State (42% Hispanic, and 10% American Indian), New Mexico's 1.9 million people have tremendous cancer health disparities. Ranking only 47th in per capita income, New Mexico's population is relatively young, poor (27%), and uninsured (22%). Nearly 50% live in rural areas with limited access to healthcare. Tracked by The New Mexico Tumor Registry, a founding member of the NCI SEER Program, New Mexico's multiethnic populations has strikingly different patterns of cancer incidence and mortality. While Northern NM Hispanics are derived primarily from early Spanish land grant families, Southern NM Hispanics are more frequently of Mexican descent. The Tribal communities of New Mexico are particularly diverse, with 19 Pueblos, the Navajo Nation and three Navajo Bands, and the Jicarilla and Mescalero Apaches. In this rich context, the goals of The New Mexico Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (NM MBCCOP) are to build community capacity for clinical research through cancer education and outreach programs, and, to overcome significant socioeconomic and cultural barriers to increase access and accrual to NCI-sponsored cancer treatment and prevention clinical trials. Funded since 2000 (U10CA86780), the NM MBCCOP has worked diligently to build a build a collaborative statewide community clinical trials network (The New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance (NMCCA)) through cooperating legal agreements with shared governance, a single IRB, and integrated operations. The 102 physician participants (61 types A and 41 type B) cover the entire State. The primary regulatory and data management functions of the NM MBCCOP and the NMCCA are located at The University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) with 8 other component and 2 affiliate community sites. The NMCCA is primarily responsible for implementing and managing the NM MBCCOP in community settings. In the past funding period, the NM MBCCOP surpassed its accrual goals, averaging 85.7 annual therapeutic and 65.34 annual prevention/control accrual credits. Therapeutic trial accruals have increased 25%. In the last funding period, 521 patients were accrued to NM MBCCOP trials, 319 (61.2%) of whom were ethnic minorities (180 Hispanic, 36 American Indian, and 103 mixed race, other minority, or undeclared). The NM MBCCOP is now poised to significantly increase overall accrual and to improve its prevention and cancer control clinical trial menu in order to increase accrual to prevention and control trials. In summary, the NM MBCCOP has a strong, well functioning statewide infrastructure, a successful accrual record, and a strategic plan for future growth.             ",New Mexico Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program,7473432,U10CA086780,"['Legal ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Data ', ' Division of Cancer Prevention ', ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ', ' ECOG ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project ', ' NSABP ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ', ' CTEP ', ' Cancer Trials Support Unit ', ' Clinical Trials Support Unit ', ' Catchment Area ', "" Children's Oncology Group "", ' Clinical Trials[{..}] Cancer Control ', ' Therapy Clinical Trials ', ' Therapeutic Trials ', ' North Central Cancer Treatment Group ', ' NCCTG ', ' Other Minority ', ' Southwest Oncology Group ', ' SWOG ', ' Monitor ', ' Adjuvant ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' rural area ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Evaluation ', ' Numbers ', ' Mexican ', ' Progress Reports ', ' SEER Program ', ' Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program ', ' SEER-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ', ' SEER Program (National Cancer Institute (U.S.)) ', ' Funding ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' New Mexico ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Navaho ', ' Navajo ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Societies ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' data management ', ' Informatics ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Breast ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Abbreviations ', ' Accountability ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Research Ethics Committees ', ' outreach program ', ' Uninsured ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Communities ', ' Review Committee ', ' treatment center ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' tribal community ', ' tribal communities ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' tumor ', ' prevention clinical trial ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,U10,2008,669904,0.0035297893789284895
"An Exploration of Perceived Racial/Ethnic Discrimination in Cancer Care Delivery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The elimination of cancer health disparities among minorities is a priority goal for Healthy People 2010 and the NCI. System-level healthcare discrimination and healthcare provider bias has received increased focus as possible contributory factors to overall health disparities and has prompted a call from NIH to further investigate the effects of racial/ethnic discrimination in healthcare. Little is known about racial/ethnic discrimination in cancer care delivery, particularly from perspectives of minority patients. The Aims of this R-03 exploratory proposal are (1) to investigate African American (AA) and Mexican American (MA) breast cancer patients perceptions of cancer care delivery, specifically perceived discrimination and (2) to analyze how ethnic/cultural group identification and Spanish-language preference affect perceptions of and experiences with cancer care delivery. A sequential triangulated qualitative design will be used to provide in-depth understanding of sociodemographic and ethnocultural aspects of cancer care from the perspectives of two minority groups. The total sample (N= 60 women) will include 20 AA patients, 20 MA predominately English- speaking patients, and 20 MA predominantly Spanish-speaking patients, diagnosed with breast cancer in the past 3 years, to explore issues related to potential language barriers and perceived racial/ethnic bias in breast cancer care delivery. These minority groups are chosen for study because of their history of discrimination in other contexts and because of their significant cancer disparities. For Aim 1, semi-structured interviews will be done with patients to analyze their perceptions and experiences of cancer care delivery using matrix analyses. For Aim 2, we will analyze how ethnic/cultural group identification affect perceptions of cancer care delivery and how these perceptions influence patients' healthcare utilization, treatment adherence, and willingness to remain engaged in continuous cancer care. Findings from this study will increase understanding of how ethnocultural factors affect minority patient experiences of cancer care and potential health-related consequences of perceived discrimination. The proposed study is a first step in a program of research to develop and test culturally responsive, evidence-based nursing and behavioral medical interventions to reduce cancer disparities among minority populations. This research project has the potential to improve the public health of minority cancer patients in the United States by highlighting perceived barriers in healthcare delivery systems. An in-depth understanding of how cultural factors affect patients' interactions with cancer physicians and other health care staff will help us to develop strategies to improve health care communication and cancer care delivery to minority populations.          ",An Exploration of Perceived Racial/Ethnic Discrimination in Cancer Care Delivery,7476547,R03CA124752,"['health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Range ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Depth ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Indium ', ' In element ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Structure ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Group Identifications ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Sampling ', ' ethnic discrimination ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer care ', ' Communication ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Conceptions ', ' ']",NCI,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R03,2008,77999,0.010526016356124858
"LSUHSC-Shreveport Feist-Weiller Cancer Center MBCCOP    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Feist-Weiller Cancer Center (FWCC) Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MB- CCOP) aims to provide increased access to state-of-the-art cancer prevention.care, and control .through NCI-sponsored clinical trials to the minority and indigent populations in the northwestern section of La., and throughout the state of Louisiana. The Feist-Weiller Cancer Center was established at the Louisiana State University Health Science Center in Shreveport (LSUHSC-S) to provide multidisciplinary cancer care, and clinical and translational research targeted to the unique population in Northwest La, which will improve the public health by decreasing cancer incidence and deaths. The population was plagued with high rates of poverty, low literacy and low levels of education, little access to modern approaches to prevention, detection, and treatment of cancer, and often presented with late stages of cancer. 55% of newly diagnosed cancer patients at LSUHSC-S are African-Americans. With the destruction of Charity and University Hospitals in New Orleans by hurricane Katrina, LSUHSC-S is now the only intact tertiary care hospital providing care to the .state's indigent and has become the major site for treatment of patients with leukemia, lymphomas and requiring bone marrow transplant. To provide local access to cancer clinical trials for the increased referal area.the FWCC plans to establish an organizational and operational base which will provide the structure to effectively implement a program to provide a multidisciplinary approach to cancer care and prevention for patients referred to the FWCC and in the patients' local comunities. The FWCC MB-CCOP will provide access to NCI-sponsored clinical trials, and research coordinator support. Education will be provided to community physicians through teleconferencing cancer tumor boards. Outreach programs to educate the indigent and minority population about cancer prevention, screening, and treatment, and clinical trials available through the FWCC MB-CCOP will be conducted w/ the assistance of the Louisiana Cancer Control Partnership, an organization dedicated to reducing cancer disparities by providng education, screening, referrals, information dissemination, and other resources in the minority and underserved communities.

"UPMC McKeesport/ROCOG Radiation Oncology Minorities Outreach Group DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   A number of barriers, both real and perceived, tend to hinder the recruitment of patients, and by extension, minorities and poor people into clinical oncology trials at community centers. In order to initiate the opportunity to participate in clinical research at the community level, we have developed a collaborative regional network, The Radiation Oncology Community Outreach Group (ROCOG), based at UPMC McKeesport Hospital, that will build the infrastructure for clinical research at five community hospitals over the term of the grant, and which will deploy infrastructure resources for widespread, clinically and demographically disparate populations. Project goals include increasing clinical compliance, protocol recruitment and protocol retention within these populations, operationalizing a collaborative model of community based research, testing the efficacy of patient identification, engagement and outreach models and using a comprehensive outcomes measurement system to insure care quality and monitor treatment disparities. This proposal presents a number of other unique approaches and strengths. Several potential academic ""mentors"" have provided their endorsement, including the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Allegheny General Hospital Cancer Institute, Roswell Park Cancer Institute and the Mallincrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University at St. Louis. The proposal also has the support of several well-recognized minority health initiatives within western Pennsylvania, to assist us in outreach and disparities education. Our outreach strategies are tailored to urban or to rural areas, and include use of a new ""fast track"" patient identification function within Tumor Registry, Patient Navigator system, Protocol Nurse and contracted community outreach agencies. The proposed clinical pilots concerning breast conservation, colorectal and bone mets reflect locally-specific high burden of disease within minority populations. An integrated outcomes monitoring system using Tumor Registry & Record & Verify data is also proposed as a platform for a comprehensive CQI program. Finally, comprehensive patient and professional education will be provided through a combination of peer outreach, WEB-based programming and through a mobile application of the NCI Telesynergy system.

"Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program at Meharry Medical College    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minority populations have multiple impediments to proper health care. This disparity is particularly noted for cancer where African-Americans have an overall cancer death rate that is greater than for all other ethnic groups. Furthermore, the ratio of black:white cancer related mortality continues to worsen for both males and females. Considering these facts, it is clear that meaningful efforts for cancer care is required for minority populations. One focus of this effort is the necessity to increase minority and underserved patient accrual to cancer therapy (CT) and cancer prevention and control (CP/C) trials where minority populations are substantially underrepresented, even correcting for their relative frequency to Caucasian populations. This proposal continues the successful initial accomplishments of the MBCCOP at Meharry Medical College (MMC) that established and sustained a mechanism to bring state-of-the-art cancer clinical trials to minority populations and to involve community practicing physicians in NCI-sponsored clinical trials. This application will continue and enhance the specific aims that are to 1) broaden access to cancer treatment by entering substantial numbers of minority patients onto NCI approved CT and CP/C studies, 2) involve communities and community health centers in cancer trials and investigate their impact on community medical practices, 3) increase community practicing physician participation on NCI approved studies and 4) transfer new technology to health care providers caring for minority and underserved populations. MMC, with greater than 40% of newly diagnosed cancer patients representing minorities, will serve as the central core supported by its active cancer research and treatment trials program. The catchment region will be Metropolitan Davidson County (MDC) where minority populations make up approximately 33% of the entire population. The CT affiliate components of the MBCCOP will continue to include the areas largest multi- physician oncology practice (Sara Cannon Research Institute/Tennessee Oncology) and the sole minority directed hematology/oncology practice in MDC, Nashville Oncology Associates. Together, these groups care for large numbers of minority patients and have proven successful in placing substantial numbers of patients on NCI approved protocols. The CP/C program will continue to use an established consortium of primary care health clinics that focus on minorities and the underserved as well as accruing to CT studies that have CP/C components. The community health centers are particularly well-suited to perform CP/C studies requiring non-cancer patients such as breast cancer prevention trials. The overall design of the MBCCOP with its established infrastructure together with affiliates and well-defined clinical trial methods will continue to accrue substantial numbers of patients onto NCI approved CT and CP/C studies.           ",Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program at Meharry Medical College,7685269,U10CA107612,"['Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Breast Cancer Prevention Trial ', ' Data ', ' Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project ', ' NSABP ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Death Rates ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Community Practice ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Rate ', ' Community Health ', ' Female ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Hematology ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Numbers ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Funding ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Tennessee ', ' Time ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' data management ', ' metropolitan ', ' Breast ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Specialist ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' treatment trial ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer type ', ' health practice ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Population Group ', ' ']",NCI,MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE,U10,2008,86725,0.10613943565436815
"Communicating about Clinical Trials:Bringing the CIS to the Underserved    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Public hospital patients, often of low socioeconomic status and diverse race/ethnicity (the ""underserved""), have few options for understanding and managing their illness, and they are also underrepresented in clinical trials. The National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service (CIS), a source of high quality cancer information for the public has gone largely unused by those most in need. Specific Aims: To provide appropriate clinical trials information to support public hospital patients making informed decisions about their treatment, this study has three specific aims: 1. to assess and document clinical trial information needs of African American, Latino, and White public hospital cancer patients; 2. to assess and adapt the CIS standard of service regarding clinical trial information through modification of current CIS telephone response for low literacy and diverse cultures and development of a proactive telephone protocol to improve caller question asking skills, increase information efficacy, and encourage participation in clinical trials; and 3. To pilot test the new adapted protocol for feasibility and efficacy. Study Design: This study consists of two phases. In Phase 1 multiple qualitative methods will be used to understand clinical trial information needs and to develop and pretest enhanced CIS protocols. We will gain insight into meanings patients attribute to clinical trials and 'research', document language patients use to discuss clinical trials and experimental treatments, and observe effective communications and miscommunications around provider/patient clinical trial information sharing through direct observations and ethnographic interviews. We will adapt/develop culturally appropriate protocols through: i) review of standard CIS clinical trials training; ii) prompted calls by patients to the CIS followed by patient and phone specialist debriefing interviews; and iii) patient focus groups. In Phase II we will pilot test the adapted protocols for feasibility and efficacy using pre- and post-call interviews. The conceptual framework is drawn from Subjective Culture, Informed Decision-making, and Social Learning Theories. Relevance to Public Health: Increasing participation of minorities in clinical trials research has been identified as a means to address cancer disparities. Recent research suggests that minorities are as willing as non-Hispanic whites to participate in clinical research if given appropriate information and opportunity. Building upon a pre-existing, federally funded cancer information resource (CIS), this study aims to bring appropriate cancer clinical trials information to underserved cancer patients and their families who need it the most.            ",Communicating about Clinical Trials:Bringing the CIS to the Underserved,7470798,K07CA126999,"['Decision Making ', ' Provider ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Purpose ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Emotions ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Health Communication ', ' Information Resources ', ' knowledge resources ', ' knowledge resource ', ' information resource ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Research Training ', ' Telephone Number ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Information Service ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Trials Information for Patients ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Placement ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Cancer Hospital ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' literacy ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mission ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Patients ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' programs ', ' survivorship ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Class ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' California ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' outreach ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Specialist ', ' response ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communication ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' Computers ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K07,2008,129600,0.09507654301238469

"Increasing Cancer Clinical Trial Enrollment in North Carolina Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Nationally, compared to Caucasians, African-Americans are diagnosed with more advanced cancer, experience a 25% higher cancer mortality rate, and have 5-year survival rates that are as much as 34% lower among the cancers of greatest incidence. In North Carolina, racial and ethnic minorities experience cancer incidence, mortality, and survival rates that are even worse than those experienced nationally among several cancers. Clinical trials have been widely looked to as a means of resolving treatment disparities, as well as disseminating state-of-the-art care more broadly into the community where the majority of cancer care is delivered. However, enrollment in clinical trials in North Carolina remains low, especially among minority populations. The goal of this pilot study is to inform the development of a targeted intervention to improve cancer clinical trials participation among minorities and others who are under-represented in cancer clinical trials in North Carolina. Specifically, Phase I will be a population-based quantitative analysis employing innovative methods to estimate and examine National Cancer Institute (NCI) clinical trial enrollment rates by race, gender, age group, geographic region (each county), and income level, and examine how these rates have changed over time. In Phase II, we will work with our existing community partners to conduct focus groups with community members and community clinicians to better understand reasons for the under-enrollment identified in Phase I. Finally, in collaboration with our community partners and informed by existing programs used to educate communities about clinical trials, we will develop a targeted intervention to increase cancer clinical trial enrollment rates in underserved populations in North Carolina.             ",Increasing Cancer Clinical Trial Enrollment in North Carolina Communities,7459271,U01CA114629,"['Provider ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Monitoring Clinical Trials ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Other Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' USA Georgia ', ' Western Asia Georgia ', ' Georgian SSR ', ' Georgian S.S.R.

"Kalamazoo Community Clinical Oncology Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Kalamazoo Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) is a consortium of the West Michigan Cancer Center (WMCC), Borgess Medical Center and Bronson Methodist Hospital, which serve as cancer referral centers for the 9-county Southwest Michigan area. The Kalamazoo CCOP also affiliates with Mid- Michigan Physicians medical oncologists in East Lansing to enroll individuals on clinical trials. The Kalamazoo CCOP intends to significantly increase the number of cancer patients formally on high priority clinical trials through the organization of cancer care specialists and primary care physicans. The program will expand community involvement in cancer control activities to a broader segment of the population to include minorities, women and the underserved. The Kalamazoo CCOP will expand the use of clinical trials, which will increase the diffusion of new cancer care technology for widespread use in the community. Clinical trials for cancer treatment and control will be obtained from ECOG, NSABP, RTOG, MDA, U of M and URCC. Clinical trials will be reviewed and approved for use by the Kalamazoo CCOP investigators and the WMCC Institutional Review Board. Knowledge gained from clinical trials or awareness of new clinical trials will be presented to the community physicians through tumor boards, educational conferences and personal contact. The intended effectiveness of the Kalamazoo CCOP will be carefully monitored on an ongoing basis. It is believed that the continuation and expansion of treatment, prevention and cancer control trials through the Kalamazoo CCOP will contribute measurably to the Healthy People 2010 overall goals of reducing the overall cancer death rate, increasing years of healthy life, increasing the number of individuals screened for cancers, reducing disparities in health care among different population groups and to achieving access to preventive health services, therefore reducing cancer incidence, morbidity and mortality.           ",Kalamazoo Community Clinical Oncology Program,7491542,U10CA035184,"['Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' Diffusion ', ' Population Group ', ' Institution ', ' Clinical Oncology ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ', ' ECOG ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project ', ' NSABP ', ' Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ', ' RTOG ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Cancer Death Rates ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Prevention Trial ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Clinical Trials[{..}] Cancer Control ', ' Clinical Trials[{..}] Cancer Treatment ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' New Agents ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Sentinel Lymph Node ', ' Sentinel Node ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hepatic ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Liver diseases ', ' liver disorder ', ' hepatopathy ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' Medical Staff ', ' Michigan ', ' radiologist ', ' RDST ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Medical Oncologist ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Letters ', ' Ownership ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Preventive Health Services ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Community Physician ', ' Methodist Church ', ' Methodists ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Technology ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' Awareness ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' Surgeon ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cancer referral center ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Participant ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' County ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Ethics Committees ', ' Specialist ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' treatment trial ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Minority ', ' daily functioning ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' volunteer ', ' rehabilitation management ', ' rehab management ', ' tumor ', ' prevention clinical trial ', ' ']",NCI,WEST MICHIGAN CANCER CENTER,U10,2008,670631,0.11679767376848971
"Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program at Meharry Medical College    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minority populations have multiple impediments to proper health care. This disparity is particularly noted for cancer where African-Americans have an overall cancer death rate that is greater than for all other ethnic groups. Furthermore, the ratio of black:white cancer related mortality continues to worsen for both males and females. Considering these facts, it is clear that meaningful efforts for cancer care is required for minority populations. One focus of this effort is the necessity to increase minority and underserved patient accrual to cancer therapy (CT) and cancer prevention and control (CP/C) trials where minority populations are substantially underrepresented, even correcting for their relative frequency to Caucasian populations. This proposal continues the successful initial accomplishments of the MBCCOP at Meharry Medical College (MMC) that established and sustained a mechanism to bring state-of-the-art cancer clinical trials to minority populations and to involve community practicing physicians in NCI-sponsored clinical trials. This application will continue and enhance the specific aims that are to 1) broaden access to cancer treatment by entering substantial numbers of minority patients onto NCI approved CT and CP/C studies, 2) involve communities and community health centers in cancer trials and investigate their impact on community medical practices, 3) increase community practicing physician participation on NCI approved studies and 4) transfer new technology to health care providers caring for minority and underserved populations. MMC, with greater than 40% of newly diagnosed cancer patients representing minorities, will serve as the central core supported by its active cancer research and treatment trials program. The catchment region will be Metropolitan Davidson County (MDC) where minority populations make up approximately 33% of the entire population. The CT affiliate components of the MBCCOP will continue to include the areas largest multi- physician oncology practice (Sara Cannon Research Institute/Tennessee Oncology) and the sole minority directed hematology/oncology practice in MDC, Nashville Oncology Associates. Together, these groups care for large numbers of minority patients and have proven successful in placing substantial numbers of patients on NCI approved protocols. The CP/C program will continue to use an established consortium of primary care health clinics that focus on minorities and the underserved as well as accruing to CT studies that have CP/C components. The community health centers are particularly well-suited to perform CP/C studies requiring non-cancer patients such as breast cancer prevention trials.

"Enhancing Minority Participation in Clinical Trials (EMPaCT)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently more than one-third of the U.S. population is of a minority population. Between 2000 and 2008, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that U.S. minority population has reached 104.6 million people, or 34% of the nation's total population, up from 31% in 2000. Even more telling of the changes to come, 44% of the children under the age of 18 are born to minority families, and nearly 48% of the children under age 5 are from minority families. These data are important in the setting of less than 5% of all adults diagnosed with cancer or other chronic diseases are enrolled in clinical trials and of that only 10% are minorities. These challenging data provide a backdrop for increasing the cost of health care due to persistent disparities in treatment outcomes and access to health care through therapeutic and population-based trials. In light of our current population dynamic, failing to increase minority participation in clinical trials is not an option. Failing to do so perpetuates two health care systems through producing clinical trial results that often neglects the specific needs regularly identified from these trials to effectively treat minority populations - failure to increase minority participation misses the opportunity to provide effective, detailed, and often improved care via clinical trials. A focus on recruitment of minorities into clinical trials also provides a novel mechanism to engage the part of our nation at the greatest medical risk, those on the fringe of the healthcare safety net and for whom data is persistently limited and/or missing in the areas of chronic diseases and cancer. Our proposal, Enhancing Minority Participation in Clinical Trials (EMPaCT), seeks to establish a national network through two internationally recognized leaders at the University of Minnesota and the University of Alabama at Birmingham in the areas of health disparities and cancer care, both actively involved leaders in their NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers and NCMHD centers of excellence, to build regional consortia through 5 U.S. Regions and regional institution leaders. Each of these Regions will include 4-7 academic institutions with NCI-designated cancer centers and NCMHD-funded health disparities programs and target minority serving institutions with health disparity programs. This program seeks to increase minority recruitment and retention into clinical trials through the following Specific Aims: 1. Develop a regional consortia and network of individual institutions and centers to enhance minority participation in clinical trials; 2. Develop community-based participatory research and education programs to combat the underlying mistrust of the medical research community; 3. Enable EMPaCT participating institutions to enhance minority participation in clinical trials by implementing models shown to more successfully link investigators with their target communities; 4. Provide the environment for conducting clinical research for minority-related diseases. Enhancing Minority Participation in Clinical Trials (EMPaCT) is a national network and regional consortia for the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities into clinical trials. The research strategy will establish coordinated underrepresented minority patient recruitment and retention infrastructure within each participating cancer center based on an assessment of each center's existing resources and needs and to encompass a patient recruitment model and/or a patient navigation model, integrating the expertise of the NCI- funded cancer center and the NCMHD-funded center of excellence at the local institution. The regional consortia system and its lead institutions will provide points of development and expertise enhancing minority participation in clinical trials through education and infrastructure. The program will be supported through an online national database of cancer clinical trials, a web-based education module for health care providers, and a communication platform for supporting the national network. The two lead institutions (UMN and UAB) will coordinate the evaluation of all EMPaCT objectives and activities.          PROJECT NARRATIVE Enhancing Minority Participation in Clinical Trials (EMPaCT) is a national network and regional consortia for the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities into clinical trials.

"New Mexico Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program    Description (provided by applicant):   With the highest proportion of Hispanics and American Indians of any State (42% Hispanic, and 10% American Indian), New Mexico's 1.9 million people have tremendous cancer health disparities. Ranking only 47th in per capita income, New Mexico's population is relatively young, poor (27%), and uninsured (22%). Nearly 50% live in rural areas with limited access to healthcare. Tracked by The New Mexico Tumor Registry, a founding member of the NCI SEER Program, New Mexico's multiethnic populations has strikingly different patterns of cancer incidence and mortality. While Northern NM Hispanics are derived primarily from early Spanish land grant families, Southern NM Hispanics are more frequently of Mexican descent. The Tribal communities of New Mexico are particularly diverse, with 19 Pueblos, the Navajo Nation and three Navajo Bands, and the Jicarilla and Mescalero Apaches. In this rich context, the goals of The New Mexico Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (NM MBCCOP) are to build community capacity for clinical research through cancer education and outreach programs, and, to overcome significant socioeconomic and cultural barriers to increase access and accrual to NCI-sponsored cancer treatment and prevention clinical trials. Funded since 2000 (U10CA86780), the NM MBCCOP has worked diligently to build a build a collaborative statewide community clinical trials network (The New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance (NMCCA)) through cooperating legal agreements with shared governance, a single IRB, and integrated operations. The 102 physician participants (61 types A and 41 type B) cover the entire State. The primary regulatory and data management functions of the NM MBCCOP and the NMCCA are located at The University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) with 8 other component and 2 affiliate community sites. The NMCCA is primarily responsible for implementing and managing the NM MBCCOP in community settings. In the past funding period, the NM MBCCOP surpassed its accrual goals, averaging 85.7 annual therapeutic and 65.34 annual prevention/control accrual credits. Therapeutic trial accruals have increased 25%. In the last funding period, 521 patients were accrued to NM MBCCOP trials, 319 (61.2%) of whom were ethnic minorities (180 Hispanic, 36 American Indian, and 103 mixed race, other minority, or undeclared). The NM MBCCOP is now poised to significantly increase overall accrual and to improve its prevention and cancer control clinical trial menu in order to increase accrual to prevention and control trials. In summary, the NM MBCCOP has a strong, well functioning statewide infrastructure, a successful accrual record, and a strategic plan for future growth.             ",New Mexico Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program,7643448,U10CA086780,"['Legal ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Data ', ' Division of Cancer Prevention ', ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ', ' ECOG ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project ', ' NSABP ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ', ' CTEP ', ' Cancer Trials Support Unit ', ' Clinical Trials Support Unit ', ' Catchment Area ', "" Children's Oncology Group "", ' Therapy Clinical Trials ', ' Therapeutic Trials ', ' North Central Cancer Treatment Group ', ' NCCTG ', ' Southwest Oncology Group ', ' SWOG ', ' Monitor ', ' Adjuvant ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' rural area ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' tumor registry ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Evaluation ', ' Mexican ', ' Progress Reports ', ' SEER Program ', ' Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program ', ' SEER-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ', ' SEER Program (National Cancer Institute (U.S.)) ', ' Funding ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' New Mexico ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Navaho ', ' Navajo ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Societies ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' meetings ', ' data management ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Breast ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Abbreviations ', ' Accountability ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Research Ethics Committees ', ' outreach program ', ' Uninsured ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Communities ', ' Review Committee ', ' treatment center ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' Minority ', ' tribal community ', ' tribal communities ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' prevention clinical trial ', ' informatics shared resource ', ' community setting ', ' control trial ', ' Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,U10,2009,789903,0.0035297893789284895

"Bioethics Research Infrastructure Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Program Abstract/Summary: The University of Maryland Baltimore is submitting this application to establish a Bioethics Center under the NCMHD ARRA Scientific priority area ""Bioethics Research Infrastructure Initiative"" through ""GO"" grants RFA-OD-09-004. This Bioethics Center's programs and research are based on a tested, proven model for increasing availability/participation of rural and urban cancer patients in clinical trials and research in general, which resulted in a US DHHS National Best Practice award. The model, combines specific clinical trial accrual and barrier research, education and training for the general public, patients, health professionals (i.e. physicians and policy, which will address and resolve barriers to recruitment of diverse communities in trials in the State of Maryland and in the US). Our demonstrated success with achieving diversity in clinical trial accrual includes a 40% accrual rate of African Americans in cancer center trials, a 25% rural African American accrual in cancer trials (therapeutic, prevention and control), a 20 fold increase in trial availability and a 40 fold increase in rural cancer patient accrual in a five-year period. The Center will support a comprehensive approach to bioethics, diversity in clinical trial participation and participation in research. Through this approach and the aims, we will support the acceleration of the national research enterprise across the continuum. RELEVANCE TO AIMS FOR ARRA and GO Grants: The Center aims and programs are consistent with the intent of the ARRA GO grant funding and include: 1. Creates jobs and promotes economic investment; 2.

"Communicating about Clinical Trials:Bringing the CIS to the Underserved    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Public hospital patients, often of low socioeconomic status and diverse race/ethnicity (the ""underserved""), have few options for understanding and managing their illness, and they are also underrepresented in clinical trials. The National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service (CIS), a source of high quality cancer information for the public has gone largely unused by those most in need. Specific Aims: To provide appropriate clinical trials information to support public hospital patients making informed decisions about their treatment, this study has three specific aims: 1. to assess and document clinical trial information needs of African American, Latino, and White public hospital cancer patients; 2. to assess and adapt the CIS standard of service regarding clinical trial information through modification of current CIS telephone response for low literacy and diverse cultures and development of a proactive telephone protocol to improve caller question asking skills, increase information efficacy, and encourage participation in clinical trials; and 3. To pilot test the new adapted protocol for feasibility and efficacy. Study Design: This study consists of two phases. In Phase 1 multiple qualitative methods will be used to understand clinical trial information needs and to develop and pretest enhanced CIS protocols. We will gain insight into meanings patients attribute to clinical trials and 'research', document language patients use to discuss clinical trials and experimental treatments, and observe effective communications and miscommunications around provider/patient clinical trial information sharing through direct observations and ethnographic interviews. We will adapt/develop culturally appropriate protocols through: i) review of standard CIS clinical trials training; ii) prompted calls by patients to the CIS followed by patient and phone specialist debriefing interviews; and iii) patient focus groups. In Phase II we will pilot test the adapted protocols for feasibility and efficacy using pre- and post-call interviews. The conceptual framework is drawn from Subjective Culture, Informed Decision-making, and Social Learning Theories. Relevance to Public Health: Increasing participation of minorities in clinical trials research has been identified as a means to address cancer disparities. Recent research suggests that minorities are as willing as non-Hispanic whites to participate in clinical research if given appropriate information and opportunity. Building upon a pre-existing, federally funded cancer information resource (CIS), this study aims to bring appropriate cancer clinical trials information to underserved cancer patients and their families who need it the most.

"Improving Cancer Outcomes for Underserved Populations in SE North Carolina    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The primary objective of the project is to increase accrual of African American and other underserved patient populations in Southeastern North Carolina (SENC) onto NCI-sponsored clinical trials. The ultimate goal at the completion of the five-year grant funding period will be for NHRMC to apply to become a minority-based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MB-CCOP) or standard CCOP by achieving the required annual patient accrual rates for these programs. Based upon the current patient population, NHRMC would not be able to eligible to apply for MB-CCOP status. African Americans comprise approximately 25% of the total patient population in SENC as well as at ZCC specifically, far short of the 40% minority population required to be eligible for MB-CCOP application. However, inclusion of Hispanic and poor White patient's results in a total of approximately 38-40% underserved population. In either case, whether MB-CCOP or standard CCOP status is sought, the addition of cancer prevention and symptom management studies as well as three planned investigator-initiated studies described herein will greatly enhance the likelihood that this goal is achieved. Secondary program objectives will be to: 1) Sustain and grow a robust clinical trials infrastructure; 2) Increase the number of oncologists both in the community and in the academic partner institutions that are actively involved in clinical research that specifically addresses underserved populations; 3) Continue to break down barriers to cancer care for the underserved via an increasingly independent patient navigation program.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       This project will allow NHRMC and the partner institutions to increase access and accrual to clinical trials thus reducing disparities in cancer outcomes among the underserved and minorities.             This project will allow NHRMC and the partner institutions to increase access and accrual to clinical trials thus reducing disparities in cancer outcomes among the underserved and minorities.",Improving Cancer Outcomes for Underserved Populations in SE North Carolina,7754935,U54CA142152,"['Institution ', ' Address ', ' Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' symptom management ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Funding ', ' Oncologist ', ' cancer prevention ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patients ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' programs ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' cancer care ', ' Communities ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' ']",NCI,NEW HANOVER REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER,U54,2009,450000,0.06111449795173507

"Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials Network Statistical and Data Management    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of the NETT Network is to create a research network of clinicians in emergency medicine, neurology and neurosurgery to promote efficiency in the design, implementation and analysis of clinical trials of therapies for patients with acute neurological disorders. To achieve this endeavor, the NINDS has planned a research infrastructure with: (1) a clinical coordinating center (CCC) to provide overall leadership and coordination of activities of the NETT; (2) a statistical and data management center (SDMC); (3) clinical centers (in a hub and spoke model) to recruit and treat study subjects; and (4) the NINDS to provide scientific input and oversight through a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and an external advisory group. The SDMC's role is to establish a collaborative relationship with all parties involved in the Network and provide efficient data management and statistical contribution in the design and analysis of the two large Phase III clinical trials to be conducted by the Network during the grant period. With the support of the Data Coordination Unit (DCU) housed within the Department of Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology (DB2E) at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), we are well-equipped to fill this role and partner with the clinical teams on these trials. Our experience in directing statistical and data coordinating center for large multicenter clinical studies of similar type has enabled us to develop web-based data and project management systems in which high data quality is ensured directly by site research staff; study activities are coordinated with high efficiency and study information is available to authorized personnel in real time. As the SDMC, our goal is to promote and facilitate the NETT Network research activities and contribute to collaborative research. As the SDMC for the NETT Network, we will accomplish the following aims: (1) to establish a collaborate relationship with the Network participants; (2) to actively contribute to the planning and conduct of two large clinical trials of neurological emergencies to be developed by the Network and approved by the Advisory Group; (3) to develop and implement the web-based databases using the WebDCU system for data entry and management and to facilitate the work of the CCC for the clinical trials; (4) to conduct interim and final statistical analyses of safety and efficacy data of the clinical trials; (5) to generate reports to the Steering Committee and the DSMB; and (6) in collaboration with the Steering Committee and the Network investigators, disseminate the study results in the form of abstract presentations, manuscript publications, and through the trial websites accessible to the public.           ",Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials Network Statistical and Data Management,7690795,U01NS059041,"['Data Collection ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Emergency treatment ', ' Emergency Therapy ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Therapeutic Clinical Trial ', ' Case Report Form ', ' Therapy Clinical Trials ', ' Therapeutic Trials ', ' Monitor ', ' Common Data Element ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Telemedicine ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Ensure ', ' Leadership ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Research Activity ', ' Data Quality ', ' Maintenance ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurology ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Collaborations ', ' Phase III Clinical Trials ', ' phase III trial ', ' phase III protocol ', ' phase 3 trial ', ' Phase 3 Clinical Trials ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' programs ', ' South Carolina ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' meetings ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Manuscripts ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' adjudication ', ' adjudicative process and procedure ', ' Study Subject ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Reporting ', ' acute stroke ', ' acute cerebrovascular accident ', ' Generations ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' abstracting ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Modeling ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic encephalopathy ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' statistical center ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees ', ' Safety Monitoring Boards ', ' Data and Safety Monitoring Boards ', ' Data Monitoring Committees ', ' treatment trial ', ' health economics ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Neurological emergencies ', ' Neurologic emergencies ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NINDS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,U01,2009,680993,0.043699916829450285

Building upon a pre-existing, federally funded cancer information resource (CIS), this study aims to bring appropriate cancer clinical trials information to underserved cancer patients and their families who need it the most.            ",Communicating about Clinical Trials:Bringing the CIS to the Underserved,7643294,K07CA126999,"['Health ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' literacy ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mission ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Patients ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' programs ', ' survivorship ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' California ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' outreach ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Specialist ', ' response ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communication ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' Computers ', ' Decision Making ', ' Provider ', ' Diagnosis ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Emotions ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Health Communication ', ' Information Resources ', ' knowledge resources ', ' knowledge resource ', ' information resource ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Information Service ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Trials Information for Patients ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K07,2009,129600,0.09507654301238469
"PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY EDUCATION    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pediatric cancer is the leading cause of death in childhood from medical conditions in the US. Thus pediatric cancer education is important for pediatricians and family medicine physicians, so that it can be diagnosed early, when it is most curable. The Pediatric Oncology Education (POE) program provides knowledge and experience to enable promising students to consider careers in cancer research, clinical practice, and related areas. Particular attention is given to including students from groups that are under-represented among oncology scientists and clinicians. POE program participants are outstanding pre-doctoral biomedical science students and health professions (medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, nursing) students interested in careers in oncology or pediatrics.       All participants are US citizens or permanent residents. Their tenure is a minimum of 11 weeks (9 weeks for medical students; 10 weeks for returning students). Students are matched with a St. Jude faculty mentor with similar research interests. They participate in the mentor's ongoing research program. They attend ongoing institutional clinical and basic research conferences, as well as a Lunch & Learn seminar series designed specifically for them. They give a PowerPoint presentation on their research project in the Lunch & Learn series. They submit a report on their research project written in the style of a journal in which their mentor publishes.       Ongoing assessment and evaluation of the program is provided by pre- and post-experience testing of the student's knowledge of pediatric cancer and related areas, post-experience surveys completed by the student and by the mentor, and overall program evaluation by the program advisory group. An experienced R25E investigator from a prominent cancer center will review the program as a consultant in 2005. Many participants (27% in 2001-2004) return for an additional appointment, thus reinforcing their cancer education and biomedical research experience. 1995-2003 program participants are authors on 119 peer-reviewed publications to date. A long-term tracking process is in place. Of former program participants who have now finished their academic degree work, 88% have a doctorate, including 80% of the under-represented minority participants.       The program is advertised by word of mouth, our web site, and announcements mailed to all US medical schools and to all historically minority colleges and universities. Approximately 400 students apply for the program each year. The 2004 acceptance rate was 13.9%, and the class average gpa was 3.75. One-third of 1995-2004 participants were under-represented minority students, and nearly two-thirds were women.

"Identifying Strategies to Increase Engagement in Clinical Trials in Pediatric SCD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application responds to broad challenge grant area (04): Clinical Research and specific Challenge Topic, 04-MD-101: Enhancing Recruitment and Retention of Ethnic Minorities in Clinical Trials. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder affecting primarily African-Americans in the United States. Since the 1970s, efforts have been made to develop efficacious treatments for SCD; however, low overall enrollment and poor retention has slowed progress towards identification of efficacious medical and psychosocial treatments. We aim, in Phase 1, to delineate factors associated with engagement in clinical trials for pediatric patients with SCD and their caregivers using questionnaires (n = 50) and follow-up interviews (n = 10-15) from 4 groups: (1) pediatric patients with SCD (ages 6-18 years) and their caregivers treated at the Marian Anderson Sickle Cell Center of St. Christopher's Hospital for Children; (2) pediatric patients with SCD (ages 6-18 years) and their caregivers treated in the community; (3) pediatric patients with asthma (ages 6-18 years) and their caregivers treated at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children; and (4) young adults with SCD (ages 18-39 years) and their caregivers. Based on Phase 1 findings, we will develop a structured recruitment and retention protocol implemented through patient navigation. The protocol will include screening for perceived barriers and benefits to participation and provide targeted strategies to decrease barriers and increase acceptability. In Phase 2, we will test the feasibility and effectiveness of the protocol with patient navigation (a health care professional from the SCD community) to increase recruitment and retention rates and socioeconomic diversity of participants with SCD and their caregivers in a current NHLBI-funded psychosocial clinical trial. Through collaboration among The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), the Marian Anderson Sickle Cell Center, and community organizations, we will develop community-generated, empirically-based strategies to support engagement in clinical trials for pediatric patients with SCD and their caregivers and increase the likelihood that current and future clinical trials will meet their aims in identifying efficacious treatments. CHOP contributes substantially to the local economy. In 2008, CHOP's operations created and supported over 16,882 jobs in the region, total economic impact was over $2.01 billion, and CHOP received more total research support than any other children's hospital in the United States. St. Christopher's Hospital for Children is a major pediatric center including a 150-bed in-patient facility, a teaching and education center and research laboratories (through its affiliation with Drexel University College of Medicine), which serves as a regional referral hospital for children from around Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley. This proposal will create 3 positions for ethnic minority health care professionals (Research Coordinator; Research Assistant, Patient Navigator), bolster 3 community agencies that advocate for ethnic minority patients, families, and health care providers, and provide support for 7 additional positions. The proposed study seeks to: (1) delineate factors associated with engagement in clinical trials for pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their caregivers and (2) develop and pilot test a structured recruitment and retention protocol implemented through patient navigation. Low overall enrollment and poor retention has slowed progress towards identification of efficacious medical and psychosocial treatments for SCD, a genetic disorder affecting primarily African-Americans in the United States. Use of community-generated, empirically-based strategies to support engagement in clinical trials for pediatric patients with SCD and their caregivers will improve health care services for this population, by increasing access to clinical trials and enhancing the success of pediatric SCD clinical trials, and has applicability to other pediatric health disparity chronic illnesses.               PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study seeks to: (1) delineate factors associated with engagement in clinical trials for pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their caregivers and (2) develop and pilot test a structured recruitment and retention protocol implemented through patient navigation.

"Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program at Meharry Medical College    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minority populations have multiple impediments to proper health care. This disparity is particularly noted for cancer where African-Americans have an overall cancer death rate that is greater than for all other ethnic groups. Furthermore, the ratio of black:white cancer related mortality continues to worsen for both males and females. Considering these facts, it is clear that meaningful efforts for cancer care is required for minority populations. One focus of this effort is the necessity to increase minority and underserved patient accrual to cancer therapy (CT) and cancer prevention and control (CP/C) trials where minority populations are substantially underrepresented, even correcting for their relative frequency to Caucasian populations. This proposal continues the successful initial accomplishments of the MBCCOP at Meharry Medical College (MMC) that established and sustained a mechanism to bring state-of-the-art cancer clinical trials to minority populations and to involve community practicing physicians in NCI-sponsored clinical trials. This application will continue and enhance the specific aims that are to 1) broaden access to cancer treatment by entering substantial numbers of minority patients onto NCI approved CT and CP/C studies, 2) involve communities and community health centers in cancer trials and investigate their impact on community medical practices, 3) increase community practicing physician participation on NCI approved studies and 4) transfer new technology to health care providers caring for minority and underserved populations. MMC, with greater than 40% of newly diagnosed cancer patients representing minorities, will serve as the central core supported by its active cancer research and treatment trials program. The catchment region will be Metropolitan Davidson County (MDC) where minority populations make up approximately 33% of the entire population. The CT affiliate components of the MBCCOP will continue to include the areas largest multi- physician oncology practice (Sara Cannon Research Institute/Tennessee Oncology) and the sole minority directed hematology/oncology practice in MDC, Nashville Oncology Associates. Together, these groups care for large numbers of minority patients and have proven successful in placing substantial numbers of patients on NCI approved protocols. The CP/C program will continue to use an established consortium of primary care health clinics that focus on minorities and the underserved as well as accruing to CT studies that have CP/C components. The community health centers are particularly well-suited to perform CP/C studies requiring non-cancer patients such as breast cancer prevention trials. The overall design of the MBCCOP with its established infrastructure together with affiliates and well-defined clinical trial methods will continue to accrue substantial numbers of patients onto NCI approved CT and CP/C studies.

"A Targeted Decision Aid to Improve Minority Participation in Clinical Trials    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Randomized clinical trials are the gold standard for evaluation of medical interventions. However, recruitment of patients, particularly minorities, into trials is often difficult. Slow and non-representative trial accrual delays the assessment and introduction of new treatments, increases the cost, and reduces the generalizability of trials. Despite a growing number of programs and websites are providing information on clinical trials (two examples are the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Education Series website, and the National Medical Association's Project I.M.P.A.C.T. (Increase Minority Participation and Awareness of Clinical Trials)), there has been little progress in improving minority participation. Thus, we believe that a novel approach, which targets the specific concerns and knowledge needs of minorities, and which empowers them to personally consider and then discuss with their physician participation in trials, is needed. In the proposed research, we directly address the problem of low minority participation rates in clinical trials through a development of a decision aid (DA) for participation in clinical trials that is targeted to minority individuals. Decision aids (DAs) have been widely and successfully used in treatment and screening situations. A systematic review of DA trials has shown that patients receiving DAs have a higher knowledge of options and outcomes, more realistic expectations, less difficulty in reaching a decision, and more active participation in decision making than individuals who do not receive the DA. However, despite the fact that decision to participate in clinical trials is one of the most difficult and complex health care decisions for individuals, almost no previous work as been done on decision aid for clinical trials participation. We believe that participation in clinical trials, particularly for minorities, will be increased by the availability of a well-design, culturally sensitive decision aid. Thus, our goal for this research is to develop and test for effectiveness a minority targeted DA for participation in clinical trials. Specifically our aims are: Aim 1: Assemble a comprehensive database on attitudes, barriers and facilitators of participation in trials through integration of information from qualitative interviews with African American cancer survivors and/or family members, a systematic literature review, and a recently completed study of cancer clinical trials participation. Aim 2: Develop a targeted web-based decision aid in English and Spanish that has as its goals: a) providing information about clinical trials in a comprehensible way, b) improving patient self-efficacy for discussing trials with health care providers, and c) helping patients clarify their beliefs/values regarding the benefits and risks of participating in a trial. Aim 3: Explore the efficacy, usefulness, and effects of the decision aid a population of Hispanic and African American cancer survivors and family members. The proposed research will develop a targeted decision aid that aims to improve participation and particularly improve minority participation in a wide range of clinical trials. More efficient and representative recruitment means that clinical trials can accrue participants in a more timely fashion, and thus results about the effectiveness of new treatments and therapies can be obtained more efficiently. Thus, the proposed research will have a wide reaching effect on the clinical trials research community, and consequently on entire populations of patients who will benefit from the newly developed treatments and therapies.           Project Narrative The proposed research will develop a targeted decision aid that aims to improve participation and particularly improve minority participation in a wide range of clinical trials.

"Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program at Meharry Medical College    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minority populations have multiple impediments to proper health care. This disparity is particularly noted for cancer where African-Americans have an overall cancer death rate that is greater than for all other ethnic groups. Furthermore, the ratio of black:white cancer related mortality continues to worsen for both males and females. Considering these facts, it is clear that meaningful efforts for cancer care is required for minority populations. One focus of this effort is the necessity to increase minority and underserved patient accrual to cancer therapy (CT) and cancer prevention and control (CP/C) trials where minority populations are substantially underrepresented, even correcting for their relative frequency to Caucasian populations. This proposal continues the successful initial accomplishments of the MBCCOP at Meharry Medical College (MMC) that established and sustained a mechanism to bring state-of-the-art cancer clinical trials to minority populations and to involve community practicing physicians in NCI-sponsored clinical trials. This application will continue and enhance the specific aims that are to 1) broaden access to cancer treatment by entering substantial numbers of minority patients onto NCI approved CT and CP/C studies, 2) involve communities and community health centers in cancer trials and investigate their impact on community medical practices, 3) increase community practicing physician participation on NCI approved studies and 4) transfer new technology to health care providers caring for minority and underserved populations. MMC, with greater than 40% of newly diagnosed cancer patients representing minorities, will serve as the central core supported by its active cancer research and treatment trials program. The catchment region will be Metropolitan Davidson County (MDC) where minority populations make up approximately 33% of the entire population. The CT affiliate components of the MBCCOP will continue to include the areas largest multi- physician oncology practice (Sara Cannon Research Institute/Tennessee Oncology) and the sole minority directed hematology/oncology practice in MDC, Nashville Oncology Associates. Together, these groups care for large numbers of minority patients and have proven successful in placing substantial numbers of patients on NCI approved protocols. The CP/C program will continue to use an established consortium of primary care health clinics that focus on minorities and the underserved as well as accruing to CT studies that have CP/C components. The community health centers are particularly well-suited to perform CP/C studies requiring non-cancer patients such as breast cancer prevention trials. The overall design of the MBCCOP with its established infrastructure together with affiliates and well-defined clinical trial methods will continue to accrue substantial numbers of patients onto NCI approved CT and CP/C studies.           ",Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program at Meharry Medical College,7656855,U10CA107612,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Population Group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Breast Cancer Prevention Trial ', ' Data ', ' Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project ', ' NSABP ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Death Rates ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Community Practice ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Community Health ', ' Female ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Hematology ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Funding ', ' male ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Tennessee ', ' Time ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' data management ', ' metropolitan ', ' Breast ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Specialist ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' treatment trial ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer type ', ' health practice ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' control trial ', ' ']",NCI,MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE,U10,2009,427630,0.10613943565436815
"New Mexico Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program    Description (provided by applicant):   With the highest proportion of Hispanics and American Indians of any State (42% Hispanic, and 10% American Indian), New Mexico's 1.9 million people have tremendous cancer health disparities. Ranking only 47th in per capita income, New Mexico's population is relatively young, poor (27%), and uninsured (22%). Nearly 50% live in rural areas with limited access to healthcare. Tracked by The New Mexico Tumor Registry, a founding member of the NCI SEER Program, New Mexico's multiethnic populations has strikingly different patterns of cancer incidence and mortality. While Northern NM Hispanics are derived primarily from early Spanish land grant families, Southern NM Hispanics are more frequently of Mexican descent. The Tribal communities of New Mexico are particularly diverse, with 19 Pueblos, the Navajo Nation and three Navajo Bands, and the Jicarilla and Mescalero Apaches. In this rich context, the goals of The New Mexico Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (NM MBCCOP) are to build community capacity for clinical research through cancer education and outreach programs, and, to overcome significant socioeconomic and cultural barriers to increase access and accrual to NCI-sponsored cancer treatment and prevention clinical trials. Funded since 2000 (U10CA86780), the NM MBCCOP has worked diligently to build a build a collaborative statewide community clinical trials network (The New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance (NMCCA)) through cooperating legal agreements with shared governance, a single IRB, and integrated operations. The 102 physician participants (61 types A and 41 type B) cover the entire State. The primary regulatory and data management functions of the NM MBCCOP and the NMCCA are located at The University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) with 8 other component and 2 affiliate community sites. The NMCCA is primarily responsible for implementing and managing the NM MBCCOP in community settings. In the past funding period, the NM MBCCOP surpassed its accrual goals, averaging 85.7 annual therapeutic and 65.34 annual prevention/control accrual credits. Therapeutic trial accruals have increased 25%. In the last funding period, 521 patients were accrued to NM MBCCOP trials, 319 (61.2%) of whom were ethnic minorities (180 Hispanic, 36 American Indian, and 103 mixed race, other minority, or undeclared). The NM MBCCOP is now poised to significantly increase overall accrual and to improve its prevention and cancer control clinical trial menu in order to increase accrual to prevention and control trials. In summary, the NM MBCCOP has a strong, well functioning statewide infrastructure, a successful accrual record, and a strategic plan for future growth.

"Today's Truth - Research Brings Hope: Ethical Issues in Health Disparities and Ac    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This application addresses the broad Challenge Area-- 02 Bioethics and the specific Challenge Topic: 02-0DCOSP)-102 WEthicallssues in Health DisDarities and Access to ParticiDation in Research"" . The research focuses on the critical need to develop patient-level interventions to increase the representation of African Americans in cancer clinical trials. This need extends to the general underrepresentation of African Americans in clinical trials throughout the nation. We will design and assess the impact of a culturally appropriate educational video, developed with active community participation, which targets six documented cultural and attitudinal barriers to African American participation in clinical trials. The video will show, through compelling patient stories and physician interviews, how barriers can ""fall away."" The 15-minute video will be divided into 6 mini-segments, one for each barrier. A representative Community Advisory Group (GAG) will be established to offer insight and guidance toward initial planning of the script for the video. The GAG will be comprised of leaders from faith-based organizations, businesses, community organizations, political leaders, someone with a high family incidence of cancer, and African American cancer patients who enrolled to a therapeutic clinical trial. One of the nation's most successful health videographers will work with us to use proven media techniques effective with African American patients. The study sample will be African American cancer patients at Washington Cancer Institute with any type of cancer whose oncologist has determined to be potentially eligible for a therapeutic clinical trial. Prior to making a decision about enrolling to the therapeutic clinical trial, the oncologist will ask his/her patient to consider this educational video study. Consented patients will undergo a one-page interviewer-administered survey questionnaire designed to assess attitudes toward therapeutic clinical trials and likelihood of trial participation. Participants will be asked to view the educational video immediately after completing the baseline questionnaire and will complete the same questionnaire immediately after viewing the video. The proposed design utilizes a pre-testlpost-test method to determine the impact of the patient education video on three variables: 1) attitudes toward therapeutic clinical trials (Trust in doctors, Altruism, Perceived personal benefits, perceived negative aspects, Inconvenience factors); 2) likely participation in therapeutic clinical trials; and 3) actual trial enrollment. We expect to demonstrate significant improvements in attitudes toward clinical trials after viewing the educational video and achieve a rate of therapeutic trial participation equal to the national average for all cancer patients. This research has a potential national impact and will be designed for immediate national dissemination. The video, if proven effective, will be offered to NCI Cooperative Groups, such as the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP), Cancer and Leukemia Group B (GALGB), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). In addition, the video may be shown in churches and other community settings to initiate and facilitate dialogue within the African American community.              ",Today's Truth - Research Brings Hope: Ethical Issues in Health Disparities and Ac,7814328,RC1MD004185,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ', ' ECOG ', ' National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project ', ' NSABP ', ' Therapeutic Clinical Trial ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer and Leukemia Group B ', ' CALGB ', ' Therapy Clinical Trials ', ' Therapeutic Trials ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Family ', ' GAG Gene ', ' GAG ', ' base ', ' Health ', ' Area ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' insight ', ' Altruism ', ' Trust ', ' Methods ', ' Oncologist ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Questionnaire Designs ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Attitude ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Techniques ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Church ', ' Participant ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Businesses ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cancer type ', ' community organizations ', ' community setting ', ' ']",NIMHD,MEDSTAR HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,RC1,2009,425569,0.06502526978610816
"MS/AL Radiation Oncology Research Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       In 2003, Singing River Hospital System (SRHS) was awarded a 5-year NIH grant which allowed SRHS to build infrastructure and establish a clinical research program aimed at reducing barriers to clinical research for minorities and the underserved. This project will continue the efforts begun with that grant. SRHS will maintain partnerships with the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the University of Mississippi Medical Center. These collaborations provide access to NCI sponsored clinical research trials to cancer patients receiving care at SRHS. The clinical research opportunities available for the cancer patients include prevention studies and treatment trials for common cancers such as breast, lung, prostate and colorectal. SRHS also offers trials for patients facing treatment challenges such as late stage diagnosis, recurrent cancers and those with limited treatment options. More than 76 clinical trials have been opened at SRHS with more than 102 patients accrued to studies during the CDRP grant. NCI funding also provides our hospital system the opportunity to offer our patients services such as transportation, social services and educational programming. These services are benefiting the Singing River Hospital System patients as well as the community at large and national health care. The RCC medical staff provided availability of clinical research at the community level making it integral to the mission of the cancer center. Grant investigators and staff recognize the importance of clinical research and are taking steps to ensure the sustainability of the research office. During this project SRHS will strengthen its clinical research activities while lessening its need for government funding. There are five sustainability options fully detailed in the research plan. They are: 1) Development of the Coastal Research Consortium; 2) Internal Funding; 3) Expansion of clinical research to a system-wide department; 4) Collaboration with UMMC as a community clinical affiliate; and 5) pursue CCOP/MB-CCOP funding with other CDRP sites.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       Clinical research is essential to improving healthcare for the public.

"Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program at Meharry Medical College    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minority populations have multiple impediments to proper health care. This disparity is particularly noted for cancer where African-Americans have an overall cancer death rate that is greater than for all other ethnic groups. Furthermore, the ratio of black:white cancer related mortality continues to worsen for both males and females. Considering these facts, it is clear that meaningful efforts for cancer care is required for minority populations. One focus of this effort is the necessity to increase minority and underserved patient accrual to cancer therapy (CT) and cancer prevention and control (CP/C) trials where minority populations are substantially underrepresented, even correcting for their relative frequency to Caucasian populations. This proposal continues the successful initial accomplishments of the MBCCOP at Meharry Medical College (MMC) that established and sustained a mechanism to bring state-of-the-art cancer clinical trials to minority populations and to involve community practicing physicians in NCI-sponsored clinical trials. This application will continue and enhance the specific aims that are to 1) broaden access to cancer treatment by entering substantial numbers of minority patients onto NCI approved CT and CP/C studies, 2) involve communities and community health centers in cancer trials and investigate their impact on community medical practices, 3) increase community practicing physician participation on NCI approved studies and 4) transfer new technology to health care providers caring for minority and underserved populations. MMC, with greater than 40% of newly diagnosed cancer patients representing minorities, will serve as the central core supported by its active cancer research and treatment trials program. The catchment region will be Metropolitan Davidson County (MDC) where minority populations make up approximately 33% of the entire population. The CT affiliate components of the MBCCOP will continue to include the areas largest multi- physician oncology practice (Sara Cannon Research Institute/Tennessee Oncology) and the sole minority directed hematology/oncology practice in MDC, Nashville Oncology Associates. Together, these groups care for large numbers of minority patients and have proven successful in placing substantial numbers of patients on NCI approved protocols. The CP/C program will continue to use an established consortium of primary care health clinics that focus on minorities and the underserved as well as accruing to CT studies that have CP/C components. The community health centers are particularly well-suited to perform CP/C studies requiring non-cancer patients such as breast cancer prevention trials. The overall design of the MBCCOP with its established infrastructure together with affiliates and well-defined clinical trial methods will continue to accrue substantial numbers of patients onto NCI approved CT and CP/C studies.           ",Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program at Meharry Medical College,7846133,U10CA107612,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Population Group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Breast Cancer Prevention Trial ', ' Data ', ' Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project ', ' NSABP ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Death Rates ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Community Practice ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Community Health ', ' Female ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Hematology ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Funding ', ' male ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Tennessee ', ' Time ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' data management ', ' metropolitan ', ' Breast ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Specialist ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' treatment trial ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer type ', ' health practice ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' control trial ', ' ']",NCI,MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE,U10,2010,409269,0.10613943565436815

"Enhancing Minority Participation in Clinical Trials (EMPaCT)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently more than one-third of the U.S. population is of a minority population. Between 2000 and 2008, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that U.S. minority population has reached 104.6 million people, or 34% of the nation's total population, up from 31% in 2000. Even more telling of the changes to come, 44% of the children under the age of 18 are born to minority families, and nearly 48% of the children under age 5 are from minority families. These data are important in the setting of less than 5% of all adults diagnosed with cancer or other chronic diseases are enrolled in clinical trials and of that only 10% are minorities. These challenging data provide a backdrop for increasing the cost of health care due to persistent disparities in treatment outcomes and access to health care through therapeutic and population-based trials. In light of our current population dynamic, failing to increase minority participation in clinical trials is not an option. Failing to do so perpetuates two health care systems through producing clinical trial results that often neglects the specific needs regularly identified from these trials to effectively treat minority populations - failure to increase minority participation misses the opportunity to provide effective, detailed, and often improved care via clinical trials. A focus on recruitment of minorities into clinical trials also provides a novel mechanism to engage the part of our nation at the greatest medical risk, those on the fringe of the healthcare safety net and for whom data is persistently limited and/or missing in the areas of chronic diseases and cancer. Our proposal, Enhancing Minority Participation in Clinical Trials (EMPaCT), seeks to establish a national network through two internationally recognized leaders at the University of Minnesota and the University of Alabama at Birmingham in the areas of health disparities and cancer care, both actively involved leaders in their NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers and NCMHD centers of excellence, to build regional consortia through 5 U.S. Regions and regional institution leaders. Each of these Regions will include 4-7 academic institutions with NCI-designated cancer centers and NCMHD-funded health disparities programs and target minority serving institutions with health disparity programs. This program seeks to increase minority recruitment and retention into clinical trials through the following Specific Aims: 1. Develop a regional consortia and network of individual institutions and centers to enhance minority participation in clinical trials; 2. Develop community-based participatory research and education programs to combat the underlying mistrust of the medical research community; 3. Enable EMPaCT participating institutions to enhance minority participation in clinical trials by implementing models shown to more successfully link investigators with their target communities; 4. Provide the environment for conducting clinical research for minority-related diseases. Enhancing Minority Participation in Clinical Trials (EMPaCT) is a national network and regional consortia for the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities into clinical trials. The research strategy will establish coordinated underrepresented minority patient recruitment and retention infrastructure within each participating cancer center based on an assessment of each center's existing resources and needs and to encompass a patient recruitment model and/or a patient navigation model, integrating the expertise of the NCI- funded cancer center and the NCMHD-funded center of excellence at the local institution. The regional consortia system and its lead institutions will provide points of development and expertise enhancing minority participation in clinical trials through education and infrastructure. The program will be supported through an online national database of cancer clinical trials, a web-based education module for health care providers, and a communication platform for supporting the national network. The two lead institutions (UMN and UAB) will coordinate the evaluation of all EMPaCT objectives and activities.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Enhancing Minority Participation in Clinical Trials (EMPaCT) is a national network and regional consortia for the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities into clinical trials.

"Identifying Strategies to Increase Engagement in Clinical Trials in Pediatric SCD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application responds to broad challenge grant area (04): Clinical Research and specific Challenge Topic, 04-MD-101: Enhancing Recruitment and Retention of Ethnic Minorities in Clinical Trials. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder affecting primarily African-Americans in the United States. Since the 1970s, efforts have been made to develop efficacious treatments for SCD; however, low overall enrollment and poor retention has slowed progress towards identification of efficacious medical and psychosocial treatments. We aim, in Phase 1, to delineate factors associated with engagement in clinical trials for pediatric patients with SCD and their caregivers using questionnaires (n = 50) and follow-up interviews (n = 10-15) from 4 groups: (1) pediatric patients with SCD (ages 6-18 years) and their caregivers treated at the Marian Anderson Sickle Cell Center of St. Christopher's Hospital for Children; (2) pediatric patients with SCD (ages 6-18 years) and their caregivers treated in the community; (3) pediatric patients with asthma (ages 6-18 years) and their caregivers treated at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children; and (4) young adults with SCD (ages 18-39 years) and their caregivers. Based on Phase 1 findings, we will develop a structured recruitment and retention protocol implemented through patient navigation. The protocol will include screening for perceived barriers and benefits to participation and provide targeted strategies to decrease barriers and increase acceptability. In Phase 2, we will test the feasibility and effectiveness of the protocol with patient navigation (a health care professional from the SCD community) to increase recruitment and retention rates and socioeconomic diversity of participants with SCD and their caregivers in a current NHLBI-funded psychosocial clinical trial. Through collaboration among The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), the Marian Anderson Sickle Cell Center, and community organizations, we will develop community-generated, empirically-based strategies to support engagement in clinical trials for pediatric patients with SCD and their caregivers and increase the likelihood that current and future clinical trials will meet their aims in identifying efficacious treatments. CHOP contributes substantially to the local economy. In 2008, CHOP's operations created and supported over 16,882 jobs in the region, total economic impact was over $2.01 billion, and CHOP received more total research support than any other children's hospital in the United States. St. Christopher's Hospital for Children is a major pediatric center including a 150-bed in-patient facility, a teaching and education center and research laboratories (through its affiliation with Drexel University College of Medicine), which serves as a regional referral hospital for children from around Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley. This proposal will create 3 positions for ethnic minority health care professionals (Research Coordinator; Research Assistant, Patient Navigator), bolster 3 community agencies that advocate for ethnic minority patients, families, and health care providers, and provide support for 7 additional positions. The proposed study seeks to: (1) delineate factors associated with engagement in clinical trials for pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their caregivers and (2) develop and pilot test a structured recruitment and retention protocol implemented through patient navigation. Low overall enrollment and poor retention has slowed progress towards identification of efficacious medical and psychosocial treatments for SCD, a genetic disorder affecting primarily African-Americans in the United States. Use of community-generated, empirically-based strategies to support engagement in clinical trials for pediatric patients with SCD and their caregivers will improve health care services for this population, by increasing access to clinical trials and enhancing the success of pediatric SCD clinical trials, and has applicability to other pediatric health disparity chronic illnesses.               PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study seeks to: (1) delineate factors associated with engagement in clinical trials for pediatric patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and their caregivers and (2) develop and pilot test a structured recruitment and retention protocol implemented through patient navigation.

"PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY EDUCATION    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pediatric cancer is the leading cause of death in childhood from medical conditions in the US. Thus pediatric cancer education is important for pediatricians and family medicine physicians, so that it can be diagnosed early, when it is most curable. The Pediatric Oncology Education (POE) program provides knowledge and experience to enable promising students to consider careers in cancer research, clinical practice, and related areas. Particular attention is given to including students from groups that are under-represented among oncology scientists and clinicians. POE program participants are outstanding pre-doctoral biomedical science students and health professions (medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, nursing) students interested in careers in oncology or pediatrics.       All participants are US citizens or permanent residents. Their tenure is a minimum of 11 weeks (9 weeks for medical students; 10 weeks for returning students). Students are matched with a St. Jude faculty mentor with similar research interests. They participate in the mentor's ongoing research program. They attend ongoing institutional clinical and basic research conferences, as well as a Lunch & Learn seminar series designed specifically for them. They give a PowerPoint presentation on their research project in the Lunch & Learn series. They submit a report on their research project written in the style of a journal in which their mentor publishes.       Ongoing assessment and evaluation of the program is provided by pre- and post-experience testing of the student's knowledge of pediatric cancer and related areas, post-experience surveys completed by the student and by the mentor, and overall program evaluation by the program advisory group. An experienced R25E investigator from a prominent cancer center will review the program as a consultant in 2005. Many participants (27% in 2001-2004) return for an additional appointment, thus reinforcing their cancer education and biomedical research experience. 1995-2003 program participants are authors on 119 peer-reviewed publications to date. A long-term tracking process is in place. Of former program participants who have now finished their academic degree work, 88% have a doctorate, including 80% of the under-represented minority participants.       The program is advertised by word of mouth, our web site, and announcements mailed to all US medical schools and to all historically minority colleges and universities. Approximately 400 students apply for the program each year. The 2004 acceptance rate was 13.9%, and the class average gpa was 3.75. One-third of 1995-2004 participants were under-represented minority students, and nearly two-thirds were women. The Program Director reports on the program regularly at the American Association for Cancer Education annual meeting.            ",PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY EDUCATION,7816954,R25CA023944,"['Public Health Students ', ' Dentistry ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Program Reviews ', ' Qualifying ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Pediatric Oncology ', "" Saint Jude Children's Research Hospital "", "" St.Jude Children's Research Hospital "", "" St.Jude Children's Cancer Center "", "" St. Jude Children's Research Hospital "", "" St. Jude Children's Cancer Center "", ' St. Jude ', "" Saint Jude Children's Cancer Center "", ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Process ', ' Faculty ', ' Family Practice ', ' family medicine ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Advertising ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Health Occupations ', ' health science profession ', ' Health Professions ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Learning ', ' insight ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' pediatrician ', ' Fostering ', ' Mails ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Malignant Childhood Neoplasm ', ' pediatric neoplasm/cancer ', ' pediatric cancer ', ' Malignant Pediatric Tumor ', ' Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Childhood Tumor ', ' Childhood Cancers ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Peer Review ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Physicians ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Psychology ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Appointment ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Science ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Medical Students ', ' Nursing Students ', ' Pupil Nurses ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Attention ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Awareness ', ' Techniques ', ' Academic degree ', ' interest ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' meetings ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' childhood cancer survivor ', ' pediatric cancer survivor ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Population ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' clinical practice ', ' ']",NCI,ST.

"MS/AL Radiation Oncology Research Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       In 2003, Singing River Hospital System (SRHS) was awarded a 5-year NIH grant which allowed SRHS to build infrastructure and establish a clinical research program aimed at reducing barriers to clinical research for minorities and the underserved. This project will continue the efforts begun with that grant. SRHS will maintain partnerships with the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the University of Mississippi Medical Center. These collaborations provide access to NCI sponsored clinical research trials to cancer patients receiving care at SRHS. The clinical research opportunities available for the cancer patients include prevention studies and treatment trials for common cancers such as breast, lung, prostate and colorectal. SRHS also offers trials for patients facing treatment challenges such as late stage diagnosis, recurrent cancers and those with limited treatment options. More than 76 clinical trials have been opened at SRHS with more than 102 patients accrued to studies during the CDRP grant. NCI funding also provides our hospital system the opportunity to offer our patients services such as transportation, social services and educational programming. These services are benefiting the Singing River Hospital System patients as well as the community at large and national health care. The RCC medical staff provided availability of clinical research at the community level making it integral to the mission of the cancer center. Grant investigators and staff recognize the importance of clinical research and are taking steps to ensure the sustainability of the research office. During this project SRHS will strengthen its clinical research activities while lessening its need for government funding. There are five sustainability options fully detailed in the research plan. They are: 1) Development of the Coastal Research Consortium; 2) Internal Funding; 3) Expansion of clinical research to a system-wide department; 4) Collaboration with UMMC as a community clinical affiliate; and 5) pursue CCOP/MB-CCOP funding with other CDRP sites.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       Clinical research is essential to improving healthcare for the public.

"Improving Cancer Outcomes for Underserved Populations in SE North Carolina    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The primary objective of the project is to increase accrual of African American and other underserved patient populations in Southeastern North Carolina (SENC) onto NCI-sponsored clinical trials. The ultimate goal at the completion of the five-year grant funding period will be for NHRMC to apply to become a minority-based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MB-CCOP) or standard CCOP by achieving the required annual patient accrual rates for these programs. Based upon the current patient population, NHRMC would not be able to eligible to apply for MB-CCOP status. African Americans comprise approximately 25% of the total patient population in SENC as well as at ZCC specifically, far short of the 40% minority population required to be eligible for MB-CCOP application. However, inclusion of Hispanic and poor White patient's results in a total of approximately 38-40% underserved population. In either case, whether MB-CCOP or standard CCOP status is sought, the addition of cancer prevention and symptom management studies as well as three planned investigator-initiated studies described herein will greatly enhance the likelihood that this goal is achieved. Secondary program objectives will be to: 1) Sustain and grow a robust clinical trials infrastructure; 2) Increase the number of oncologists both in the community and in the academic partner institutions that are actively involved in clinical research that specifically addresses underserved populations; 3) Continue to break down barriers to cancer care for the underserved via an increasingly independent patient navigation program.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       This project will allow NHRMC and the partner institutions to increase access and accrual to clinical trials thus reducing disparities in cancer outcomes among the underserved and minorities.             This project will allow NHRMC and the partner institutions to increase access and accrual to clinical trials thus reducing disparities in cancer outcomes among the underserved and minorities.",Improving Cancer Outcomes for Underserved Populations in SE North Carolina,7928758,U54CA142152,"['Institution ', ' Address ', ' Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' symptom management ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Funding ', ' Oncologist ', ' cancer prevention ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patients ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' programs ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' cancer care ', ' Communities ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' ']",NCI,NEW HANOVER REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER,U54,2010,648992,0.06111449795173507
"A Targeted Decision Aid to Improve Minority Participation in Clinical Trials    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Randomized clinical trials are the gold standard for evaluation of medical interventions. However, recruitment of patients, particularly minorities, into trials is often difficult. Slow and non-representative trial accrual delays the assessment and introduction of new treatments, increases the cost, and reduces the generalizability of trials. Despite a growing number of programs and websites are providing information on clinical trials (two examples are the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Education Series website, and the National Medical Association's Project I.M.P.A.C.T. (Increase Minority Participation and Awareness of Clinical Trials)), there has been little progress in improving minority participation. Thus, we believe that a novel approach, which targets the specific concerns and knowledge needs of minorities, and which empowers them to personally consider and then discuss with their physician participation in trials, is needed. In the proposed research, we directly address the problem of low minority participation rates in clinical trials through a development of a decision aid (DA) for participation in clinical trials that is targeted to minority individuals. Decision aids (DAs) have been widely and successfully used in treatment and screening situations. A systematic review of DA trials has shown that patients receiving DAs have a higher knowledge of options and outcomes, more realistic expectations, less difficulty in reaching a decision, and more active participation in decision making than individuals who do not receive the DA. However, despite the fact that decision to participate in clinical trials is one of the most difficult and complex health care decisions for individuals, almost no previous work as been done on decision aid for clinical trials participation. We believe that participation in clinical trials, particularly for minorities, will be increased by the availability of a well-design, culturally sensitive decision aid. Thus, our goal for this research is to develop and test for effectiveness a minority targeted DA for participation in clinical trials. Specifically our aims are: Aim 1: Assemble a comprehensive database on attitudes, barriers and facilitators of participation in trials through integration of information from qualitative interviews with African American cancer survivors and/or family members, a systematic literature review, and a recently completed study of cancer clinical trials participation. Aim 2: Develop a targeted web-based decision aid in English and Spanish that has as its goals: a) providing information about clinical trials in a comprehensible way, b) improving patient self-efficacy for discussing trials with health care providers, and c) helping patients clarify their beliefs/values regarding the benefits and risks of participating in a trial. Aim 3: Explore the efficacy, usefulness, and effects of the decision aid a population of Hispanic and African American cancer survivors and family members. The proposed research will develop a targeted decision aid that aims to improve participation and particularly improve minority participation in a wide range of clinical trials. More efficient and representative recruitment means that clinical trials can accrue participants in a more timely fashion, and thus results about the effectiveness of new treatments and therapies can be obtained more efficiently. Thus, the proposed research will have a wide reaching effect on the clinical trials research community, and consequently on entire populations of patients who will benefit from the newly developed treatments and therapies.           Project Narrative The proposed research will develop a targeted decision aid that aims to improve participation and particularly improve minority participation in a wide range of clinical trials.

"Queens Cancer Center Minority-Based Community Clincal Oncology Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Queens Cancer Center (QCC) is uniquely qualified to become a Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program. QCC is part of the Queens Health Network (QHN) which is comprised of the only two public hospitals in Queens, Queens Hospital Center (QHC) and Elmhurst Hospital Center (EHC). The public hospital system of New York City provides care for a population composed almost entirely of patients from minority groups, lower economic social strata, and the uninsured. These are the very patients that this minority based CCOP RFA is targeting. Since its inception in 2002, the QCC has been dedicated to bringing the best possible cancer care to the people in Queens who were previously underserved, including minority patients, recent immigrants and patients without insurance or means. It is the only clinical comprehensive cancer center within the public hospital system of all of New York City. The population served by the Queens Health Network has an unfortunate history of late stage cancers of all kinds and poorer survival. The mission of the QCC is to reduce the rates of late stage disease and to improve the care for cancer. The strategies to accomplish this include education of the community, introduction of cancer control trials, outreach for early detection programs and state of the art cancer care including access to clinical cancer treatment trials. The patient population in the Queens Health Network is overwhelmingly from minority groups. These are the patients who do not have access to clinical trials. The Queens Health Network is the only health facility in Queens, a borough with more than 2 million people that offers access to multi-institutional treatment trials. The organization is already in place to offer some trials, but more staff is needed to expand this effort to a larger population. The purpose of this grant is to establish a minority base CCOP in the Queens Health Network so that more patients can be given access to cancer control and treatment trials.       RELEVANCE: Research in cancer control, prevention, early detection and treatment has not been offered equally to minority patients; perhaps resulting in later stage disease at presentation and worse outcomes. It is essential that the NCI support public hospital systems such as ours, with a proven track record in research, to enhance their infrastructure so that disparities in cancer care for these communities can be reduced.       ",Queens Cancer Center Minority-Based Community Clincal Oncology Program,7892625,U10CA149944,"['Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Caring ', ' Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Qualifying ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' base ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' Clinical ', ' Insurance ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mission ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' New York City ', ' Immigrant ', ' Patients ', ' Staging ', ' Research ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Uninsured ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Education ', ' Community HealthTutoring ', ' Community Health Taining ', ' Community Education ', ' treatment trial ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' control trial ', ' patient population ', ' ']",NCI,QUEENS HOSPITAL CENTER,U10,2010,480071,0.01292816361800687
"Kalamazoo Community Clinical Oncology Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Kalamazoo Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) is a consortium of the West Michigan Cancer Center (WMCC), Borgess Medical Center and Bronson Methodist Hospital, which serve as cancer referral centers for the 9-county Southwest Michigan area. The Kalamazoo CCOP also affiliates with Mid- Michigan Physicians medical oncologists in East Lansing to enroll individuals on clinical trials. The Kalamazoo CCOP intends to significantly increase the number of cancer patients formally on high priority clinical trials through the organization of cancer care specialists and primary care physicans. The program will expand community involvement in cancer control activities to a broader segment of the population to include minorities, women and the underserved. The Kalamazoo CCOP will expand the use of clinical trials, which will increase the diffusion of new cancer care technology for widespread use in the community. Clinical trials for cancer treatment and control will be obtained from ECOG, NSABP, RTOG, MDA, U of M and URCC. Clinical trials will be reviewed and approved for use by the Kalamazoo CCOP investigators and the WMCC Institutional Review Board. Knowledge gained from clinical trials or awareness of new clinical trials will be presented to the community physicians through tumor boards, educational conferences and personal contact. The intended effectiveness of the Kalamazoo CCOP will be carefully monitored on an ongoing basis. It is believed that the continuation and expansion of treatment, prevention and cancer control trials through the Kalamazoo CCOP will contribute measurably to the Healthy People 2010 overall goals of reducing the overall cancer death rate, increasing years of healthy life, increasing the number of individuals screened for cancers, reducing disparities in health care among different population groups and to achieving access to preventive health services, therefore reducing cancer incidence, morbidity and mortality.           ",Kalamazoo Community Clinical Oncology Program,7860559,U10CA035184,"['Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' Diffusion ', ' Population Group ', ' Institution ', ' Clinical Oncology ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ', ' ECOG ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project ', ' NSABP ', ' Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ', ' RTOG ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Cancer Death Rates ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Prevention Trial ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' New Agents ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Sentinel Lymph Node ', ' Sentinel Node ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hepatic ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Individual ', ' Liver diseases ', ' liver disorder ', ' hepatopathy ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' Medical Staff ', ' Michigan ', ' radiologist ', ' RDST ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Medical Oncologist ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Letters ', ' Ownership ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Preventive Health Services ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Community Physician ', ' Methodist Church ', ' Methodists ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Technology ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Clinic ', ' Awareness ', ' Techniques ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' Surgeon ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cancer referral center ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Participant ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' County ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Ethics Committees ', ' Specialist ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' treatment trial ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Minority ', ' daily functioning ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' volunteer ', ' rehabilitation management ', ' rehab management ', ' tumor ', ' prevention clinical trial ', ' control trial ', ' Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' ']",NCI,WEST MICHIGAN CANCER CENTER,U10,2010,540631,0.11679767376848971

"Today's Truth - Research Brings Hope: Ethical Issues in Health Disparities and Ac    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This application addresses the broad Challenge Area-- 02 Bioethics and the specific Challenge Topic: 02-0DCOSP)-102 WEthicallssues in Health DisDarities and Access to ParticiDation in Research"" . The research focuses on the critical need to develop patient-level interventions to increase the representation of African Americans in cancer clinical trials. This need extends to the general underrepresentation of African Americans in clinical trials throughout the nation. We will design and assess the impact of a culturally appropriate educational video, developed with active community participation, which targets six documented cultural and attitudinal barriers to African American participation in clinical trials. The video will show, through compelling patient stories and physician interviews, how barriers can ""fall away."" The 15-minute video will be divided into 6 mini-segments, one for each barrier. A representative Community Advisory Group (GAG) will be established to offer insight and guidance toward initial planning of the script for the video. The GAG will be comprised of leaders from faith-based organizations, businesses, community organizations, political leaders, someone with a high family incidence of cancer, and African American cancer patients who enrolled to a therapeutic clinical trial. One of the nation's most successful health videographers will work with us to use proven media techniques effective with African American patients. The study sample will be African American cancer patients at Washington Cancer Institute with any type of cancer whose oncologist has determined to be potentially eligible for a therapeutic clinical trial. Prior to making a decision about enrolling to the therapeutic clinical trial, the oncologist will ask his/her patient to consider this educational video study. Consented patients will undergo a one-page interviewer-administered survey questionnaire designed to assess attitudes toward therapeutic clinical trials and likelihood of trial participation. Participants will be asked to view the educational video immediately after completing the baseline questionnaire and will complete the same questionnaire immediately after viewing the video. The proposed design utilizes a pre-testlpost-test method to determine the impact of the patient education video on three variables: 1) attitudes toward therapeutic clinical trials (Trust in doctors, Altruism, Perceived personal benefits, perceived negative aspects, Inconvenience factors); 2) likely participation in therapeutic clinical trials; and 3) actual trial enrollment. We expect to demonstrate significant improvements in attitudes toward clinical trials after viewing the educational video and achieve a rate of therapeutic trial participation equal to the national average for all cancer patients. This research has a potential national impact and will be designed for immediate national dissemination. The video, if proven effective, will be offered to NCI Cooperative Groups, such as the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP), Cancer and Leukemia Group B (GALGB), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). In addition, the video may be shown in churches and other community settings to initiate and facilitate dialogue within the African American community.              Project Narrative  The high rate of mortality from cancer among African Americans is a major public health  problem in the United States.

"The MB-CCOP at Boston Medical Center The City of Boston is rich with academic medical centers and cancer care facilities. However, these resources have done little to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in cancer mortality, in part due to a lack of minority enrollment in cancer clinical trials. Boston Medical Center (BMC), the largest safety net provider in New England, stands uniquely positioned to implement a Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MB- CCOP) in attempts to reduce this disparity. More than two-thirds of BMC patients are minorities and most are low-income. BMC already has a successful Cancer Clinical Trials Program (CCTP) and a state-of-the-art cancer center that opened in 2006. Established in 1991, the BMC CCTP has developed methods for culturally sensitive outreach, recruitment, enrollment and retention in cancer clinical trials. Our CCTP research nurses have all been trained in patient navigation to help patients overcome their many barriers to care. As a result, minorities now account for 42% of cancer clinical trial enrollment. However, the lack of resources in our CCTP limits the extent to which we can offer our services beyond the confines of the institution into Boston's most impoverished and diverse communities. The MB-CCOP at BMC will provide the resources we need to facilitate access to both BMC's cancer care services and cancer clinical trials by patients receiving primary care in the community. Taking advantage of the experience at BMC with the NCI Patient Navigator Research Program, we will employ a patient navigation model for the BMC MB-CCOP. Navigators will be placed at five of Boston's community health centers (CHCs) to facilitate the communication process and the referral of appropriate patients for evaluation of clinical trials at BMC. At the same time, an MB-CCOP at BMC will provide our oncologists access to a much larger portfolio of cancer clinical trials relevant to the patient population we serve. Our specific aims are: 1) to provide patient navigation for CHC patients to facilitate access to BMC cancer care and clinical trials; 2) to promptly screen all cancer patients for clinical trial participation; 3) to provide outreach and education to community physicians and their patients, and 4) to test the effectiveness of these methods in increasing minority accruals. The overarching goal of the MB-CCOP at BMC is to enhance minority enrollment to cancer clinical trials utilizing community-based patient navigation in an effort to reduce the racial and ethnic disparities of cancer mortality in Boston.",The MB-CCOP at Boston Medical Center,7892622,U10CA139519,"['Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', '

"New Mexico Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program    Description (provided by applicant):   With the highest proportion of Hispanics and American Indians of any State (42% Hispanic, and 10% American Indian), New Mexico's 1.9 million people have tremendous cancer health disparities. Ranking only 47th in per capita income, New Mexico's population is relatively young, poor (27%), and uninsured (22%). Nearly 50% live in rural areas with limited access to healthcare. Tracked by The New Mexico Tumor Registry, a founding member of the NCI SEER Program, New Mexico's multiethnic populations has strikingly different patterns of cancer incidence and mortality. While Northern NM Hispanics are derived primarily from early Spanish land grant families, Southern NM Hispanics are more frequently of Mexican descent. The Tribal communities of New Mexico are particularly diverse, with 19 Pueblos, the Navajo Nation and three Navajo Bands, and the Jicarilla and Mescalero Apaches. In this rich context, the goals of The New Mexico Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (NM MBCCOP) are to build community capacity for clinical research through cancer education and outreach programs, and, to overcome significant socioeconomic and cultural barriers to increase access and accrual to NCI-sponsored cancer treatment and prevention clinical trials. Funded since 2000 (U10CA86780), the NM MBCCOP has worked diligently to build a build a collaborative statewide community clinical trials network (The New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance (NMCCA)) through cooperating legal agreements with shared governance, a single IRB, and integrated operations. The 102 physician participants (61 types A and 41 type B) cover the entire State. The primary regulatory and data management functions of the NM MBCCOP and the NMCCA are located at The University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) with 8 other component and 2 affiliate community sites. The NMCCA is primarily responsible for implementing and managing the NM MBCCOP in community settings. In the past funding period, the NM MBCCOP surpassed its accrual goals, averaging 85.7 annual therapeutic and 65.34 annual prevention/control accrual credits. Therapeutic trial accruals have increased 25%. In the last funding period, 521 patients were accrued to NM MBCCOP trials, 319 (61.2%) of whom were ethnic minorities (180 Hispanic, 36 American Indian, and 103 mixed race, other minority, or undeclared). The NM MBCCOP is now poised to significantly increase overall accrual and to improve its prevention and cancer control clinical trial menu in order to increase accrual to prevention and control trials. In summary, the NM MBCCOP has a strong, well functioning statewide infrastructure, a successful accrual record, and a strategic plan for future growth.             ",New Mexico Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program,7849674,U10CA086780,"['Legal ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Data ', ' Division of Cancer Prevention ', ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ', ' ECOG ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project ', ' NSABP ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ', ' CTEP ', ' Cancer Trials Support Unit ', ' Clinical Trials Support Unit ', ' Catchment Area ', "" Children's Oncology Group "", ' Therapy Clinical Trials ', ' Therapeutic Trials ', ' North Central Cancer Treatment Group ', ' NCCTG ', ' Southwest Oncology Group ', ' SWOG ', ' Monitor ', ' Adjuvant ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' rural area ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' tumor registry ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Evaluation ', ' Mexican ', ' Progress Reports ', ' SEER Program ', ' Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program ', ' SEER-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ', ' SEER Program (National Cancer Institute (U.S.)) ', ' Funding ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' New Mexico ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Navaho ', ' Navajo ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Societies ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' meetings ', ' data management ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Breast ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Abbreviations ', ' Accountability ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Research Ethics Committees ', ' outreach program ', ' Uninsured ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Communities ', ' Review Committee ', ' treatment center ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' Minority ', ' tribal community ', ' tribal communities ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' prevention clinical trial ', ' informatics shared resource ', ' community setting ', ' control trial ', ' operation ', ' Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,U10,2010,901019,0.0035297893789284895
"Communicating about Clinical Trials:Bringing the CIS to the Underserved    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Public hospital patients, often of low socioeconomic status and diverse race/ethnicity (the ""underserved""), have few options for understanding and managing their illness, and they are also underrepresented in clinical trials. The National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service (CIS), a source of high quality cancer information for the public has gone largely unused by those most in need. Specific Aims: To provide appropriate clinical trials information to support public hospital patients making informed decisions about their treatment, this study has three specific aims: 1. to assess and document clinical trial information needs of African American, Latino, and White public hospital cancer patients; 2. to assess and adapt the CIS standard of service regarding clinical trial information through modification of current CIS telephone response for low literacy and diverse cultures and development of a proactive telephone protocol to improve caller question asking skills, increase information efficacy, and encourage participation in clinical trials; and 3. To pilot test the new adapted protocol for feasibility and efficacy. Study Design: This study consists of two phases. In Phase 1 multiple qualitative methods will be used to understand clinical trial information needs and to develop and pretest enhanced CIS protocols. We will gain insight into meanings patients attribute to clinical trials and 'research', document language patients use to discuss clinical trials and experimental treatments, and observe effective communications and miscommunications around provider/patient clinical trial information sharing through direct observations and ethnographic interviews. We will adapt/develop culturally appropriate protocols through: i) review of standard CIS clinical trials training; ii) prompted calls by patients to the CIS followed by patient and phone specialist debriefing interviews; and iii) patient focus groups. In Phase II we will pilot test the adapted protocols for feasibility and efficacy using pre- and post-call interviews. The conceptual framework is drawn from Subjective Culture, Informed Decision-making, and Social Learning Theories. Relevance to Public Health: Increasing participation of minorities in clinical trials research has been identified as a means to address cancer disparities. Recent research suggests that minorities are as willing as non-Hispanic whites to participate in clinical research if given appropriate information and opportunity. Building upon a pre-existing, federally funded cancer information resource (CIS), this study aims to bring appropriate cancer clinical trials information to underserved cancer patients and their families who need it the most.            ",Communicating about Clinical Trials:Bringing the CIS to the Underserved,7874696,K07CA126999,"['Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communication ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' Computers ', ' Decision Making ', ' Provider ', ' Diagnosis ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Emotions ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Health Communication ', ' Information Resources ', ' knowledge resources ', ' knowledge resource ', ' information resource ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Information Service ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Trials Information for Patients ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' literacy ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mission ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Patients ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' programs ', ' survivorship ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' California ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' outreach ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Specialist ', ' response ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K07,2010,131220,0.09507654301238469

"Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program at Meharry Medical College    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minority populations have multiple impediments to proper health care. This disparity is particularly noted for cancer where African-Americans have an overall cancer death rate that is greater than for all other ethnic groups. Furthermore, the ratio of black:white cancer related mortality continues to worsen for both males and females. Considering these facts, it is clear that meaningful efforts for cancer care is required for minority populations. One focus of this effort is the necessity to increase minority and underserved patient accrual to cancer therapy (CT) and cancer prevention and control (CP/C) trials where minority populations are substantially underrepresented, even correcting for their relative frequency to Caucasian populations. This proposal continues the successful initial accomplishments of the MBCCOP at Meharry Medical College (MMC) that established and sustained a mechanism to bring state-of-the-art cancer clinical trials to minority populations and to involve community practicing physicians in NCI-sponsored clinical trials. This application will continue and enhance the specific aims that are to 1) broaden access to cancer treatment by entering substantial numbers of minority patients onto NCI approved CT and CP/C studies, 2) involve communities and community health centers in cancer trials and investigate their impact on community medical practices, 3) increase community practicing physician participation on NCI approved studies and 4) transfer new technology to health care providers caring for minority and underserved populations. MMC, with greater than 40% of newly diagnosed cancer patients representing minorities, will serve as the central core supported by its active cancer research and treatment trials program. The catchment region will be Metropolitan Davidson County (MDC) where minority populations make up approximately 33% of the entire population. The CT affiliate components of the MBCCOP will continue to include the areas largest multi- physician oncology practice (Sara Cannon Research Institute/Tennessee Oncology) and the sole minority directed hematology/oncology practice in MDC, Nashville Oncology Associates. Together, these groups care for large numbers of minority patients and have proven successful in placing substantial numbers of patients on NCI approved protocols. The CP/C program will continue to use an established consortium of primary care health clinics that focus on minorities and the underserved as well as accruing to CT studies that have CP/C components. The community health centers are particularly well-suited to perform CP/C studies requiring non-cancer patients such as breast cancer prevention trials. The overall design of the MBCCOP with its established infrastructure together with affiliates and well-defined clinical trial methods will continue to accrue substantial numbers of patients onto NCI approved CT and CP/C studies.

"The MB-CCOP at Boston Medical Center The City of Boston is rich with academic medical centers and cancer care facilities. However, these resources have done little to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in cancer mortality, in part due to a lack of minority enrollment in cancer clinical trials. Boston Medical Center (BMC), the largest safety net provider in New England, stands uniquely positioned to implement a Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MB- CCOP) in attempts to reduce this disparity. More than two-thirds of BMC patients are minorities and most are low-income. BMC already has a successful Cancer Clinical Trials Program (CCTP) and a state-of-the-art cancer center that opened in 2006.

"MS/AL Radiation Oncology Research Partnership In 2003, Singing River Hospital System (SRHS) was awarded a 5-year NIH grant which allowed SRHS to build infrastructure and establish a clinical research program aimed at reducing barriers to clinical research for minorities and the underserved. This project will continue the efforts begun with that grant. SRHS will maintain partnerships with the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the University of Mississippi Medical Center. These collaborations provide access to NCI sponsored clinical research trials to cancer patients receiving care at SRHS. The clinical research opportunities available for the cancer patients include prevention studies and treatment trials for common cancers such as breast, lung, prostate and colorectal. SRHS also offers trials for patients facing treatment challenges such as late stage diagnosis, recurrent cancers and those with limited treatment options. More than 76 clinical trials have been opened at SRHS with more than 102 patients accrued to studies during the CDRP grant. NCI funding also provides our hospital system the opportunity to offer our patients services such as transportation, social services and educational programming. These services are benefiting the Singing River Hospital System patients as well as the community at large and national health care. The RCC medical staff provided availability of clinical research at the community level making it integral to the mission of the cancer center. Grant investigators and staff recognize the importance of clinical research and are taking steps to ensure the sustainability of the research office. During this project SRHS will strengthen its clinical research activities while lessening its need for government funding. There are five sustainability options fully detailed in the research plan. They are: 1) Development of the Coastal Research Consortium; 2) Internal Funding; 3) Expansion of clinical research to a system-wide department; 4) Collaboration with UMMC as a community clinical affiliate; and 5) pursue CCOP/MB-CCOP funding with other CDRP sites. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Clinical research is essential to improving healthcare for the public. Our project brings clinical trials to a local hospital setting allowing patients who would not normally have access to cutting-edge medicine the opportunity to participate in clinical trials.

The Feist-Weiller Cancer Center was established at the Louisiana State University Health Science Center in Shreveport (LSUHSC-S) to provide multidisciplinary cancer care, and clinical and translational research targeted to the unique population in Northwest La, which will improve the public health by decreasing cancer incidence and deaths. The population was plagued with high rates of poverty, low literacy and low levels of education, little access to modern approaches to prevention, detection, and treatment of cancer, and often presented with late stages of cancer. 55% of newly diagnosed cancer patients at LSUHSC-S are African-Americans. With the destruction of Charity and University Hospitals in New Orleans by hurricane Katrina, LSUHSC-S is now the only intact tertiary care hospital providing care to the .state's indigent and has become the major site for treatment of patients with leukemia, lymphomas and requiring bone marrow transplant. To provide local access to cancer clinical trials for the increased referal area.the FWCC plans to establish an organizational and operational base which will provide the structure to effectively implement a program to provide a multidisciplinary approach to cancer care and prevention for patients referred to the FWCC and in the patients' local comunities. The FWCC MB-CCOP will provide access to NCI-sponsored clinical trials, and research coordinator support. Education will be provided to community physicians through teleconferencing cancer tumor boards. Outreach programs to educate the indigent and minority population about cancer prevention, screening, and treatment, and clinical trials available through the FWCC MB-CCOP will be conducted w/ the assistance of the Louisiana Cancer Control Partnership, an organization dedicated to reducing cancer disparities by providng education, screening, referrals, information dissemination, and other resources in the minority and underserved communities.

"New Mexico Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program    Description (provided by applicant):   With the highest proportion of Hispanics and American Indians of any State (42% Hispanic, and 10% American Indian), New Mexico's 1.9 million people have tremendous cancer health disparities. Ranking only 47th in per capita income, New Mexico's population is relatively young, poor (27%), and uninsured (22%). Nearly 50% live in rural areas with limited access to healthcare. Tracked by The New Mexico Tumor Registry, a founding member of the NCI SEER Program, New Mexico's multiethnic populations has strikingly different patterns of cancer incidence and mortality. While Northern NM Hispanics are derived primarily from early Spanish land grant families, Southern NM Hispanics are more frequently of Mexican descent. The Tribal communities of New Mexico are particularly diverse, with 19 Pueblos, the Navajo Nation and three Navajo Bands, and the Jicarilla and Mescalero Apaches. In this rich context, the goals of The New Mexico Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (NM MBCCOP) are to build community capacity for clinical research through cancer education and outreach programs, and, to overcome significant socioeconomic and cultural barriers to increase access and accrual to NCI-sponsored cancer treatment and prevention clinical trials. Funded since 2000 (U10CA86780), the NM MBCCOP has worked diligently to build a build a collaborative statewide community clinical trials network (The New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance (NMCCA)) through cooperating legal agreements with shared governance, a single IRB, and integrated operations. The 102 physician participants (61 types A and 41 type B) cover the entire State. The primary regulatory and data management functions of the NM MBCCOP and the NMCCA are located at The University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) with 8 other component and 2 affiliate community sites. The NMCCA is primarily responsible for implementing and managing the NM MBCCOP in community settings. In the past funding period, the NM MBCCOP surpassed its accrual goals, averaging 85.7 annual therapeutic and 65.34 annual prevention/control accrual credits. Therapeutic trial accruals have increased 25%. In the last funding period, 521 patients were accrued to NM MBCCOP trials, 319 (61.2%) of whom were ethnic minorities (180 Hispanic, 36 American Indian, and 103 mixed race, other minority, or undeclared). The NM MBCCOP is now poised to significantly increase overall accrual and to improve its prevention and cancer control clinical trial menu in order to increase accrual to prevention and control trials. In summary, the NM MBCCOP has a strong, well functioning statewide infrastructure, a successful accrual record, and a strategic plan for future growth.             ",New Mexico Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program,8080254,U10CA086780,"['Accountability ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' data management ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' Cancer Center ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Abbreviations ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Adjuvant ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Progress Reports ', ' treatment center ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' member ', ' programs ', ' community setting ', ' Population ', ' Evaluation ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' meetings ', ' Procedures ', ' Pattern ', ' Publishing ', ' Life ', ' Minority ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Data ', ' improved ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Prevention ', ' Family ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Patients ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Grant ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Societies ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communities ', ' Participant ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' operation ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' Incidence ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Funding ', ' Future ', ' Monitor ', ' Physicians ', ' Reporting ', ' Goals ', ' Medical ', ' Safety ', ' Research ', ' Universities ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Breast ', ' Work ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Site ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Agreement ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Legal ', ' cancer care ', ' control trial ', ' Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Uninsured ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ', ' CTEP ', ' Therapy Clinical Trials ', ' Therapeutic Trials ', ' outreach program ', ' SEER Program ', ' Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program ', ' SEER-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ', ' SEER Program (National Cancer Institute (U.S.)) ', ' Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project ', ' NSABP ', ' Division of Cancer Prevention ', ' North Central Cancer Treatment Group ', ' NCCTG ', ' tumor registry ', ' Review Committee ', ' Apache Indians ', ' Apache ', ' Navaho ', ' Navajo ', ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ', ' ECOG ', ' cancer education ', ' Cancer Trials Support Unit ', ' Clinical Trials Support Unit ', "" Children's Oncology Group "", ' New Mexico ', ' Mexican ', ' informatics shared resource ', ' rural area ', ' Clinical Protocols ', ' Catchment Area ', ' tribal community ', ' tribal communities ', ' Southwest Oncology Group ', ' SWOG ', ' prevention clinical trial ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,U10,2011,877016,0.0035297893789284895
"Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program at Meharry Medical College    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minority populations have multiple impediments to proper health care. This disparity is particularly noted for cancer where African-Americans have an overall cancer death rate that is greater than for all other ethnic groups. Furthermore, the ratio of black:white cancer related mortality continues to worsen for both males and females. Considering these facts, it is clear that meaningful efforts for cancer care is required for minority populations. One focus of this effort is the necessity to increase minority and underserved patient accrual to cancer therapy (CT) and cancer prevention and control (CP/C) trials where minority populations are substantially underrepresented, even correcting for their relative frequency to Caucasian populations. This proposal continues the successful initial accomplishments of the MBCCOP at Meharry Medical College (MMC) that established and sustained a mechanism to bring state-of-the-art cancer clinical trials to minority populations and to involve community practicing physicians in NCI-sponsored clinical trials. This application will continue and enhance the specific aims that are to 1) broaden access to cancer treatment by entering substantial numbers of minority patients onto NCI approved CT and CP/C studies, 2) involve communities and community health centers in cancer trials and investigate their impact on community medical practices, 3) increase community practicing physician participation on NCI approved studies and 4) transfer new technology to health care providers caring for minority and underserved populations. MMC, with greater than 40% of newly diagnosed cancer patients representing minorities, will serve as the central core supported by its active cancer research and treatment trials program. The catchment region will be Metropolitan Davidson County (MDC) where minority populations make up approximately 33% of the entire population. The CT affiliate components of the MBCCOP will continue to include the areas largest multi- physician oncology practice (Sara Cannon Research Institute/Tennessee Oncology) and the sole minority directed hematology/oncology practice in MDC, Nashville Oncology Associates. Together, these groups care for large numbers of minority patients and have proven successful in placing substantial numbers of patients on NCI approved protocols. The CP/C program will continue to use an established consortium of primary care health clinics that focus on minorities and the underserved as well as accruing to CT studies that have CP/C components. The community health centers are particularly well-suited to perform CP/C studies requiring non-cancer patients such as breast cancer prevention trials. The overall design of the MBCCOP with its established infrastructure together with affiliates and well-defined clinical trial methods will continue to accrue substantial numbers of patients onto NCI approved CT and CP/C studies.           ",Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program at Meharry Medical College,8082661,U10CA107612,"['racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' data management ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Tennessee ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Research Institute ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Community Health ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Methods ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Community Practice ', ' Time ', ' Area ', ' Woman ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Life ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Funding ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Research ', ' Prevalence ', ' Female ', ' Communities ', ' base ', ' programs ', ' Medical ', ' Patients ', ' Population ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Minority ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Specialist ', ' cancer type ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' male ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Clinic ', ' Gender ', ' Ethnic group ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' County ', ' Physicians ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Caring ', ' Breast ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Goals ', ' Data ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Health ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Population Group ', ' cancer care ', ' treatment trial ', ' control trial ', ' Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' metropolitan ', ' National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project ', ' NSABP ', ' Cancer Death Rates ', ' health practice ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Breast Cancer Prevention Trial ', ' Caucasians ', ' Hematology ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Controlled Study ', ' ']",NCI,MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE,U10,2011,402329,0.10613943565436815
"Queens Cancer Center Minority-Based Community Clincal Oncology Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Queens Cancer Center (QCC) is uniquely qualified to become a Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program. QCC is part of the Queens Health Network (QHN) which is comprised of the only two public hospitals in Queens, Queens Hospital Center (QHC) and Elmhurst Hospital Center (EHC). The public hospital system of New York City provides care for a population composed almost entirely of patients from minority groups, lower economic social strata, and the uninsured. These are the very patients that this minority based CCOP RFA is targeting. Since its inception in 2002, the QCC has been dedicated to bringing the best possible cancer care to the people in Queens who were previously underserved, including minority patients, recent immigrants and patients without insurance or means. It is the only clinical comprehensive cancer center within the public hospital system of all of New York City. The population served by the Queens Health Network has an unfortunate history of late stage cancers of all kinds and poorer survival. The mission of the QCC is to reduce the rates of late stage disease and to improve the care for cancer. The strategies to accomplish this include education of the community, introduction of cancer control trials, outreach for early detection programs and state of the art cancer care including access to clinical cancer treatment trials. The patient population in the Queens Health Network is overwhelmingly from minority groups. These are the patients who do not have access to clinical trials. The Queens Health Network is the only health facility in Queens, a borough with more than 2 million people that offers access to multi-institutional treatment trials. The organization is already in place to offer some trials, but more staff is needed to expand this effort to a larger population. The purpose of this grant is to establish a minority base CCOP in the Queens Health Network so that more patients can be given access to cancer control and treatment trials.       RELEVANCE: Research in cancer control, prevention, early detection and treatment has not been offered equally to minority patients; perhaps resulting in later stage disease at presentation and worse outcomes. It is essential that the NCI support public hospital systems such as ours, with a proven track record in research, to enhance their infrastructure so that disparities in cancer care for these communities can be reduced.       Research in cancer control, prevention, early detection and treatment has not been offered equally to minority patients; perhaps resulting in later stage disease at presentation and worse outcomes.

"The MB-CCOP at Boston Medical Center The City of Boston is rich with academic medical centers and cancer care facilities. However, these resources have done little to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in cancer mortality, in part due to a lack of minority enrollment in cancer clinical trials. Boston Medical Center (BMC), the largest safety net provider in New England, stands uniquely positioned to implement a Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MB- CCOP) in attempts to reduce this disparity. More than two-thirds of BMC patients are minorities and most are low-income. BMC already has a successful Cancer Clinical Trials Program (CCTP) and a state-of-the-art cancer center that opened in 2006. Established in 1991, the BMC CCTP has developed methods for culturally sensitive outreach, recruitment, enrollment and retention in cancer clinical trials. Our CCTP research nurses have all been trained in patient navigation to help patients overcome their many barriers to care. As a result, minorities now account for 42% of cancer clinical trial enrollment. However, the lack of resources in our CCTP limits the extent to which we can offer our services beyond the confines of the institution into Boston's most impoverished and diverse communities. The MB-CCOP at BMC will provide the resources we need to facilitate access to both BMC's cancer care services and cancer clinical trials by patients receiving primary care in the community. Taking advantage of the experience at BMC with the NCI Patient Navigator Research Program, we will employ a patient navigation model for the BMC MB-CCOP. Navigators will be placed at five of Boston's community health centers (CHCs) to facilitate the communication process and the referral of appropriate patients for evaluation of clinical trials at BMC. At the same time, an MB-CCOP at BMC will provide our oncologists access to a much larger portfolio of cancer clinical trials relevant to the patient population we serve. Our specific aims are: 1) to provide patient navigation for CHC patients to facilitate access to BMC cancer care and clinical trials; 2) to promptly screen all cancer patients for clinical trial participation; 3) to provide outreach and education to community physicians and their patients, and 4) to test the effectiveness of these methods in increasing minority accruals.

"PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY EDUCATION (YRS28-32)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pediatric cancer is the leading cause of death in childhood from medical conditions in the US. Thus, pediatric cancer education is important for pediatricians and family medicine physicians, so that cancer can be diagnosed early, when it is most curable. Cancer research is vital to developing cancer cures. The Pediatric Oncology Education (POE) program provides knowledge and experience to motivate promising students to consider careers in cancer research and related areas. Particular attention is given to including students from groups under-represented among oncology scientists and clinicians. Program participants are outstanding pre- doctoral biomedical science and health professions students interested in oncology careers.     All participants are US citizens or permanent residents. Their tenure is 11 weeks (9 weeks for medical students, 10 weeks for returnees). They are matched with a St. Jude faculty mentor with similar research interests and participate in the mentor's ongoing research program. They attend institutional clinical and basic research conferences, as well as a Lunch & Learn series designed specifically for them. They shadow an oncologist and observe in surgery. They give a PowerPoint presentation on their research project in the Lunch & Learn series and submit a project report written in the style of a journal in which their mentor publishes.     The POE program is advertised by word of mouth, our web site, by mail to over 1300 US university science faculty, cancer researchers, medical schools, historically under-represented minority (URM) colleges and universities, and by St Jude Academic Programs recruiters at numerous major scientific meetings (including the major URM science student meetings). Each year, 400 - 500 students apply for the program. The 2010 acceptance rate was 11.1% (51 of 460 applicants), and the class average undergraduate GPA was 3.825. Of 308 participants in 2005-2010, 51 (16.6%) were URM, and 189 (61.3%) were females. Many (21.1% in 2005-2010) return for an additional appointment, thus reinforcing their cancer education and research experience. To date, 1997-2009 program participants are co-authors on 200 peer-reviewed St. Jude publications.     Ongoing assessment and evaluation of the program is provided by pre- and post-experience testing of the student's knowledge of pediatric cancer and related areas, and by post-experience surveys completed by all students and mentors. Experienced cancer educators from prominent cancer centers reviewed the program as on-site consultants in 2005 and 2009. A long-term tracking process is in place. Of the 696 participants who have finished their academic degree work, 596 (85.6%) hold a doctorate, including 146 (76.8%) of 190 URM in the cohort. Of the 893 participants since 1978, 176 (19.7%) have a cancer career goal, and 88 (9.9%) are already in cancer-committed careers. The Program Director reports on the program regularly to the American Association for Cancer Education (AACE). She received the 2009 Margaret Hay Edwards Achievement Medal for sustained outstanding contributions to cancer education, the highest honor bestowed by the AACE.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Pediatric Oncology Education (POE) Program introduces outstanding biomedical science and health professions students to the latest pediatric cancer research, treatment and prevention approaches.

"MS/AL Radiation Oncology Research Partnership In 2003, Singing River Hospital System (SRHS) was awarded a 5-year NIH grant which allowed SRHS to build infrastructure and establish a clinical research program aimed at reducing barriers to clinical research for minorities and the underserved. This project will continue the efforts begun with that grant. SRHS will maintain partnerships with the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the University of Mississippi Medical Center. These collaborations provide access to NCI sponsored clinical research trials to cancer patients receiving care at SRHS. The clinical research opportunities available for the cancer patients include prevention studies and treatment trials for common cancers such as breast, lung, prostate and colorectal. SRHS also offers trials for patients facing treatment challenges such as late stage diagnosis, recurrent cancers and those with limited treatment options. More than 76 clinical trials have been opened at SRHS with more than 102 patients accrued to studies during the CDRP grant. NCI funding also provides our hospital system the opportunity to offer our patients services such as transportation, social services and educational programming. These services are benefiting the Singing River Hospital System patients as well as the community at large and national health care. The RCC medical staff provided availability of clinical research at the community level making it integral to the mission of the cancer center. Grant investigators and staff recognize the importance of clinical research and are taking steps to ensure the sustainability of the research office. During this project SRHS will strengthen its clinical research activities while lessening its need for government funding. There are five sustainability options fully detailed in the research plan. They are: 1) Development of the Coastal Research Consortium; 2) Internal Funding; 3) Expansion of clinical research to a system-wide department; 4) Collaboration with UMMC as a community clinical affiliate; and 5) pursue CCOP/MB-CCOP funding with other CDRP sites. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Clinical research is essential to improving healthcare for the public. Our project brings clinical trials to a local hospital setting allowing patients who would not normally have access to cutting-edge medicine the opportunity to participate in clinical trials.

"LSUHSC-Shreveport Feist Weiller Cancer Center MBCCOP DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Feist-Weiller Cancer Center (FWCC) Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MB-CCOP) aims to provide increased access to state-of-the-art cancer prevention care, and control through NCI-sponsored clinical trials to the minority and indigent populations in the northwestern section of La., and throughout the state of Louisiana. The Feist-Weiller Cancer Center was established at the Louisiana State University Health Science Center in Shreveport (LSUHSC-S) to provide multidisciplinary cancer care, and clinical and translational research targeted to the unique population in Northwest La, which will improve the public health by decreasing cancer incidence and deaths. The population was plagued with high rates of poverty, low literacy and low levels of education, little access to modern approaches to prevention, detection, and treatment of cancer, and often presented with late stages of cancer, Fifty-five percent of newly diagnosed cancer patients at LSUHSC-S are African-Americans, With the destruction of Charity and University Hospitals in New Orleans by hurricane Katrina, LSUHSCS is now the only intact tertiary care hospital providing care to the state's indigent population and has become the major site for treatment of patients with leukemia and lymphoma, and those requiring bone marrow transplant. To provide local access to cancer clinical trials for the increased referral area, the FWCC will continue to strengthen and expand its organizational and operational base in order to support a structure to effectively implement a program to provide a multidisciplinary approach to cancer care and prevention for patients referred to the FWCC and in the patients' local communities. The FWCC MB-CCOP has provided access to NCI-sponsored clinical trials and research coordinator support at outlying sites. Education will be provided to community physicians through teleconferencing cancer tumor boards. Outreach programs to educate the indigent and minority population about cancer prevention, screening, and treatment, and clinical trials available through the FWCC MB-CCOP will be conducted with the assistance of the Louisiana Cancer Control Partnership, an organization dedicated to reducing cancer disparities by providing education, screening, referrals, information dissemination, and other resources in the minority and underserved communities. As well, the FWCC Partners in Wellness Free cancer screening program will be utilized to spread this valuable educational information. Since the FWCC has been founded, our approach to cancer has resulted in outcomes at LSUHSC-S at least as good as the national average and far better than Louisiana as a whole which ranks 49th in cancer mortality. The FWCC has a history of greater than 40% minority accrual to SWOG, CTSU, and NCI treatment and prevention studies, as well as industry, in-house, and translational research protocols. Plans to expand minority access and accrual are detailed in this application.                 RELEVANCE: The provision of a multidisciplinary cancer care program to a population plagued by poverty, illiteracy, and little access to innovative approaches to the prevention, detection and treatment of cancer will serve to educate and treat this population, thereby decreasing cancer incidence and deaths.",LSUHSC-Shreveport Feist Weiller Cancer Center MBCCOP,8308750,U10CA128567,"['Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Charities ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' Hurricane ', ' illiteracy ', ' Incidence ', ' Indigent ', ' Industry ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' literacy ', ' Louisiana ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Patients ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Plague ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Universities ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Oncologist ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Physician ', ' programs ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention ', ' outreach program ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' Detection ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' SWOG ', ' Southwest Oncology Group ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' lymphoma/leukemia ', ' leukemia/lymphoma ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' tertiary care ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' treatment site ', ' tumor ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' ']",NCI,LOUISIANA STATE UNIV HSC SHREVEPORT,U10,2012,450583,0.0434608446956389
"Queens Cancer Center Minority-Based Community Clincal Oncology Program The Queens Cancer Center (QCC) is uniquely qualified to become a Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program. QCC is part of the Queens Health Network (QHN) which is comprised of the only two public hospitals in Queens, Queens Hospital Center (QHC) and Elmhurst Hospital Center (EHC). The public hospital system of New York City provides care for a population composed almost entirely of patients from minority groups, lower economic social strata, and the uninsured. These are the very patients that this minority based CCOP RFA is targeting.    Since its inception in 2002, the QCC has been dedicated to bringing the best possible cancer care to the people in Queens who were previously underserved, including minority patients, recent immigrants and patients without insurance or means. It is the only clinical comprehensive cancer center within the public hospital system of all of New York City. The population served by the Queens Health Network has an unfortunate history of late stage cancers of all kinds and poorer survival. The mission of the QCC is to reduce the rates of late stage disease and to improve the care for cancer. The strategies to accomplish this include education of the community, introduction of cancer control trials, outreach for early detection programs and state of the art cancer care including access to clinical cancer treatment trials. The patient population in the Queens Health Network is overwhelmingly from minority groups. These are the patients who do not have access to clinical trials. The Queens Health Network is the only health facility in Queens, a borough with more than 2 million people that offers access to multi-institutional treatment trials. The organization is already in place to offer some trials, but more staff is needed to expand this effort to a larger population. The purpose of this grant is to establish a minority base CCOP in the Queens Health Network so that more patients can be given access to cancer control and treatment trials. Research in cancer control, prevention, early detection and treatment has not been offered equally to minority patients; perhaps resulting in later stage disease at presentation and worse outcomes. It is essential that the NCI support public hospital systems such as ours, with a proven track record in research, to enhance their infrastructure so that disparities in cancer care for these communities can be reduced.",Queens Cancer Center Minority-Based Community Clincal Oncology Program,8305797,U10CA149944,"['Appointment ', ' Award ', ' bone ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast

"Florida Hospital Cancer Institute Community Clinical Oncology Program     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seventh Day Adventist Hospital System operates 37 hospitals in 10 states. In Central Florida, the Florida Hospital System has six hospital campuses (that will be participating in the FHCI-CCOP application) that bill under one license. The flagship hospital of the seven Florida Hospital System is Florida Hospital South (FH) located in Orlando, Orange County. Florida Hospital South (FH) offers a full array of services including medical oncology, radiation oncology, pediatric oncology, bone marrow transplantation, surgical oncology, neuro-oncology, and gynecologic oncology. The other five hospitals in Central Florida are located in the neighboring Oscelo and Seminole counties. A seventh hospital Florida Hospital Memorial Medical Center (MMC) is located in Volusia County. MMC is also owned by Adventist Health, but falls under a separate license. The Florida Hospital Cancer Institute (FHCI) was created to coordinate all of the cancer activities in the FH System. Dr. Lee Zehngebot has been leading the clinical activities of the FHCI for over 20 years. Dr. Zehngebot has been the architect of a successful clinical trial within the FHCI. This program has received national awards and recognition. The FHCl's Research department has a strong history of both cooperative group and pharmaceutical trials. Over the last year as we prepared for the transition to a CCOP program, FHCI enrolled CCOP credit equivalents of 56 treatment credits and 54.8 cancer control credits, with the majority of credits accrued since January 2011. In addition, FHCl's catchment area includes counties with over 40% Hispanic population and 20 % African American. While the tumor registry data only shows 11 % Hispanic and 8.5 % African American, enrollment to clinical trials shows 13% Hispanic and 10% African American. The above six hospitals in the FH System along with another MMC wish to become a CCOP. We view a CCOP award as a cornerstone to further integrate our cancer clinical trials and research programs. A CCOP award will allow FHCI to expand its clinical trials efforts in both geography and scope in the central Florida community.

"The MB-CCOP at Boston Medical Center The City of Boston is rich with academic medical centers and cancer care facilities. However, these resources have done little to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in cancer mortality, in part due to a lack of minority enrollment in cancer clinical trials. Boston Medical Center (BMC), the largest safety net provider in New England, stands uniquely positioned to implement a Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MB- CCOP) in attempts to reduce this disparity. More than two-thirds of BMC patients are minorities and most are low-income. BMC already has a successful Cancer Clinical Trials Program (CCTP) and a state-of-the-art cancer center that opened in 2006. Established in 1991, the BMC CCTP has developed methods for culturally sensitive outreach, recruitment, enrollment and retention in cancer clinical trials. Our CCTP research nurses have all been trained in patient navigation to help patients overcome their many barriers to care. As a result, minorities now account for 42% of cancer clinical trial enrollment. However, the lack of resources in our CCTP limits the extent to which we can offer our services beyond the confines of the institution into Boston's most impoverished and diverse communities. The MB-CCOP at BMC will provide the resources we need to facilitate access to both BMC's cancer care services and cancer clinical trials by patients receiving primary care in the community. Taking advantage of the experience at BMC with the NCI Patient Navigator Research Program, we will employ a patient navigation model for the BMC MB-CCOP. Navigators will be placed at five of Boston's community health centers (CHCs) to facilitate the communication process and the referral of appropriate patients for evaluation of clinical trials at BMC. At the same time, an MB-CCOP at BMC will provide our oncologists access to a much larger portfolio of cancer clinical trials relevant to the patient population we serve. Our specific aims are: 1) to provide patient navigation for CHC patients to facilitate access to BMC cancer care and clinical trials; 2) to promptly screen all cancer patients for clinical trial participation; 3) to provide outreach and education to community physicians and their patients, and 4) to test the effectiveness of these methods in increasing minority accruals.

"Beaumont Community Clinical Oncology Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): William Beaumont Hospital (BH), located in the northwest Detroit suburb of Royal Oak, Michigan (1061 beds), in the rapidly growing suburb of Troy, Michigan (361 beds), and the metropolitan setting of Grosse Pointe, Michigan (289 beds), continues to be a highly productive contributor to the NCI's Community Clinical Oncology Program. Against the diverse tri-county backdrop of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties, with a combined population of 4.5 million people, BH diagnoses and cares for over 5000 new cancer cases each year. Beaumont CCOP (B-CCOP) offers over 80 multi-disciplinary investigators in 14 specialty departments to provide this care. Since the renewal of B-CCOP funding in 2005 we have accrued a total of 730.1 treatment credits and 1263.0 cancer control credits for an impressive total of 1993.1 credits, making this a very productive grant period. Current results show strong indications that we will continue this outstanding accrual with the addition of a component site, Botsford Hospital, and the opening of a CCOP site at Beaumont, Grosse Pointe. Our goals remain the same: to increase enrollment of patients to treatment and cancer control studies, carefully following patients and participants currently on study, and to further build our outreach into our diverse communities. The specific aims of the program are to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity and mortality by accelerating the transfer of newly developed cancer prevention therapies, to improve early detection rates, and to facilitate patient treatment management, rehabilitation, and the dissemination of scientific results to the profession and to the general public. To facilitate this process B-CCOP is supported by a central office, an experienced Institutional Review Board, a dedicated investigational pharmacy, and a group of leadership committees commissioned to support protocol review and implementation, financial management and the CCOP goals and direction. Our mission: ""Cancer Clinical Trials Office at Beaumont Hospitals provides research to our community with dignity, compassion, hope and excellence in service"".       RELEVANCE: B-CCOP's goal of increasing community oncologists' involvement in state of the art cancer prevention, control and treatment trials serving a wide segment of our population, including minorities, women, and other underserved populations continues to be relevant today.

"Enhancing Minority Participation in Clinical Trials (EMPaCT):Phase II The objective of EMPaCT Phase II is to increase recruitment and retention of racial/ethnic minorities into  therapeutic clinical trials through the well-established EMPaCT consortium and in partnership with the  American Cancer Society, with the ultimate goal of reducing cancer-related health disparities.    Two Strategies will be employed to achieve this objective: a) education and training approach, implemented  through Web-based modules; and b) intervention approach, which will establish a patient navigation and  clinical trial support system.    These strategies will be pursued through the following specific aims:  1. Establish a Web-portal that: a) includes Web-based training modules customized for investigators,  research staff, referring physicians, and patient navigators; b) provides resources for recruitment and  retention; and c) serves as communications and information hub, in order to address identified barriers to  recruitment and retention of minorities into therapeutic cancer clinical trials.  2. Implement and evaluate a patient navigation program designed to increase recruitment and retention of  minority patients into therapeutic cancer clinical trials.  3. Development and pilot implementation of a) of clinical trials ombudsman at each of the five regional sites  1 to a) implement and evaluate the use of a standardized real-time tracking system of minority accrual into  therapeutic clinical trials and b) to provide oversight and evaluation of patient navigation program c) develop  and pilot evidence based recruitment and retention models in project years 3-5.    The proposed specific aims are based on the findings of qualitative and quantitative assessments of barriers  and facilitators of minority recruitment and retention into cancer clinical trials. These assessments were  implemented by the EMPaCT consortium over 2 years across all five sites and were guided by a conceptual  framework that highlights the multiple levels upon which barriers and facilitators occur.

"New Mexico Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program    Description (provided by applicant):   With the highest proportion of Hispanics and American Indians of any State (42% Hispanic, and 10% American Indian), New Mexico's 1.9 million people have tremendous cancer health disparities. Ranking only 47th in per capita income, New Mexico's population is relatively young, poor (27%), and uninsured (22%). Nearly 50% live in rural areas with limited access to healthcare. Tracked by The New Mexico Tumor Registry, a founding member of the NCI SEER Program, New Mexico's multiethnic populations has strikingly different patterns of cancer incidence and mortality. While Northern NM Hispanics are derived primarily from early Spanish land grant families, Southern NM Hispanics are more frequently of Mexican descent. The Tribal communities of New Mexico are particularly diverse, with 19 Pueblos, the Navajo Nation and three Navajo Bands, and the Jicarilla and Mescalero Apaches. In this rich context, the goals of The New Mexico Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (NM MBCCOP) are to build community capacity for clinical research through cancer education and outreach programs, and, to overcome significant socioeconomic and cultural barriers to increase access and accrual to NCI-sponsored cancer treatment and prevention clinical trials. Funded since 2000 (U10CA86780), the NM MBCCOP has worked diligently to build a build a collaborative statewide community clinical trials network (The New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance (NMCCA)) through cooperating legal agreements with shared governance, a single IRB, and integrated operations. The 102 physician participants (61 types A and 41 type B) cover the entire State. The primary regulatory and data management functions of the NM MBCCOP and the NMCCA are located at The University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) with 8 other component and 2 affiliate community sites. The NMCCA is primarily responsible for implementing and managing the NM MBCCOP in community settings. In the past funding period, the NM MBCCOP surpassed its accrual goals, averaging 85.7 annual therapeutic and 65.34 annual prevention/control accrual credits. Therapeutic trial accruals have increased 25%. In the last funding period, 521 patients were accrued to NM MBCCOP trials, 319 (61.2%) of whom were ethnic minorities (180 Hispanic, 36 American Indian, and 103 mixed race, other minority, or undeclared). The NM MBCCOP is now poised to significantly increase overall accrual and to improve its prevention and cancer control clinical trial menu in order to increase accrual to prevention and control trials. In summary, the NM MBCCOP has a strong, well functioning statewide infrastructure, a successful accrual record, and a strategic plan for future growth.

"PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY EDUCATION (YRS28-32)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pediatric cancer is the leading cause of death in childhood from medical conditions in the US. Thus, pediatric cancer education is important for pediatricians and family medicine physicians, so that cancer can be diagnosed early, when it is most curable. Cancer research is vital to developing cancer cures. The Pediatric Oncology Education (POE) program provides knowledge and experience to motivate promising students to consider careers in cancer research and related areas. Particular attention is given to including students from groups under-represented among oncology scientists and clinicians. Program participants are outstanding pre- doctoral biomedical science and health professions students interested in oncology careers.     All participants are US citizens or permanent residents. Their tenure is 11 weeks (9 weeks for medical students, 10 weeks for returnees). They are matched with a St. Jude faculty mentor with similar research interests and participate in the mentor's ongoing research program. They attend institutional clinical and basic research conferences, as well as a Lunch & Learn series designed specifically for them. They shadow an oncologist and observe in surgery. They give a PowerPoint presentation on their research project in the Lunch & Learn series and submit a project report written in the style of a journal in which their mentor publishes.     The POE program is advertised by word of mouth, our web site, by mail to over 1300 US university science faculty, cancer researchers, medical schools, historically under-represented minority (URM) colleges and universities, and by St Jude Academic Programs recruiters at numerous major scientific meetings (including the major URM science student meetings). Each year, 400 - 500 students apply for the program. The 2010 acceptance rate was 11.1% (51 of 460 applicants), and the class average undergraduate GPA was 3.825. Of 308 participants in 2005-2010, 51 (16.6%) were URM, and 189 (61.3%) were females. Many (21.1% in 2005-2010) return for an additional appointment, thus reinforcing their cancer education and research experience. To date, 1997-2009 program participants are co-authors on 200 peer-reviewed St. Jude publications.     Ongoing assessment and evaluation of the program is provided by pre- and post-experience testing of the student's knowledge of pediatric cancer and related areas, and by post-experience surveys completed by all students and mentors. Experienced cancer educators from prominent cancer centers reviewed the program as on-site consultants in 2005 and 2009. A long-term tracking process is in place. Of the 696 participants who have finished their academic degree work, 596 (85.6%) hold a doctorate, including 146 (76.8%) of 190 URM in the cohort. Of the 893 participants since 1978, 176 (19.7%) have a cancer career goal, and 88 (9.9%) are already in cancer-committed careers. The Program Director reports on the program regularly to the American Association for Cancer Education (AACE). She received the 2009 Margaret Hay Edwards Achievement Medal for sustained outstanding contributions to cancer education, the highest honor bestowed by the AACE.        The Pediatric Oncology Education (POE) Program introduces outstanding biomedical science and health professions students to the latest pediatric cancer research, treatment and prevention approaches. It provides them an opportunity to do high quality, contemporary cancer-related research with a faculty mentor, and encourages them to pursue careers in cancer research and/or cancer patient management.

"Beaumont Community Clinical Oncology Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): William Beaumont Hospital (BH), located in the northwest Detroit suburb of Royal Oak, Michigan (1061 beds), in the rapidly growing suburb of Troy, Michigan (361 beds), and the metropolitan setting of Grosse Pointe, Michigan (289 beds), continues to be a highly productive contributor to the NCI's Community Clinical Oncology Program. Against the diverse tri-county backdrop of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties, with a combined population of 4.5 million people, BH diagnoses and cares for over 5000 new cancer cases each year. Beaumont CCOP (B-CCOP) offers over 80 multi-disciplinary investigators in 14 specialty departments to provide this care. Since the renewal of B-CCOP funding in 2005 we have accrued a total of 730.1 treatment credits and 1263.0 cancer control credits for an impressive total of 1993.1 credits, making this a very productive grant period. Current results show strong indications that we will continue this outstanding accrual with the addition of a component site, Botsford Hospital, and the opening of a CCOP site at Beaumont, Grosse Pointe. Our goals remain the same: to increase enrollment of patients to treatment and cancer control studies, carefully following patients and participants currently on study, and to further build our outreach into our diverse communities.

"The MB-CCOP at Boston Medical Center The City of Boston is rich with academic medical centers and cancer care facilities. However, these resources have done little to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in cancer mortality, in part due to a lack of minority enrollment in cancer clinical trials. Boston Medical Center (BMC), the largest safety net provider in New England, stands uniquely positioned to implement a Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MB- CCOP) in attempts to reduce this disparity. More than two-thirds of BMC patients are minorities and most are low-income. BMC already has a successful Cancer Clinical Trials Program (CCTP) and a state-of-the-art cancer center that opened in 2006. Established in 1991, the BMC CCTP has developed methods for culturally sensitive outreach, recruitment, enrollment and retention in cancer clinical trials. Our CCTP research nurses have all been trained in patient navigation to help patients overcome their many barriers to care. As a result, minorities now account for 42% of cancer clinical trial enrollment. However, the lack of resources in our CCTP limits the extent to which we can offer our services beyond the confines of the institution into Boston's most impoverished and diverse communities. The MB-CCOP at BMC will provide the resources we need to facilitate access to both BMC's cancer care services and cancer clinical trials by patients receiving primary care in the community. Taking advantage of the experience at BMC with the NCI Patient Navigator Research Program, we will employ a patient navigation model for the BMC MB-CCOP. Navigators will be placed at five of Boston's community health centers (CHCs) to facilitate the communication process and the referral of appropriate patients for evaluation of clinical trials at BMC. At the same time, an MB-CCOP at BMC will provide our oncologists access to a much larger portfolio of cancer clinical trials relevant to the patient population we serve. Our specific aims are: 1) to provide patient navigation for CHC patients to facilitate access to BMC cancer care and clinical trials; 2) to promptly screen all cancer patients for clinical trial participation; 3) to provide outreach and education to community physicians and their patients, and 4) to test the effectiveness of these methods in increasing minority accruals. The overarching goal of the MB-CCOP at BMC is to enhance minority enrollment to cancer clinical trials utilizing community-based patient navigation in an effort to reduce the racial and ethnic disparities of cancer mortality in Boston.",The MB-CCOP at Boston Medical Center,8528192,U10CA139519,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Accounting ', ' Appointment ', ' Awareness ', ' Boston ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancer Care Facilities ', ' Cities ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' New England ', ' Nursing Research ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Evaluation ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Training ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Oncologist ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Community Physician ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' outreach ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Minority ', ' safety net ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' control trial ', ' patient population ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,U10,2012,139989,0.10606271231949291
"National Initiative for Minority Involvement in Neurological Clinical Trials Poor recruitment and retention of minority populations in clinical research, and clinical trials in particular,  continues to be a significant barrier in the reduction of health disparities.

"Kalamazoo Community Clinical Oncology Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Kalamazoo Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) is a consortium of the West Michigan Cancer Center (WMCC), Borgess Medical Center and Bronson Methodist Hospital, which serve as cancer referral centers for the 9-county Southwest Michigan area. The Kalamazoo CCOP also affiliates with Mid- Michigan Physicians medical oncologists in East Lansing to enroll individuals on clinical trials. The Kalamazoo CCOP intends to significantly increase the number of cancer patients formally on high priority clinical trials through the organization of cancer care specialists and primary care physicans. The program will expand community involvement in cancer control activities to a broader segment of the population to include minorities, women and the underserved. The Kalamazoo CCOP will expand the use of clinical trials, which will increase the diffusion of new cancer care technology for widespread use in the community. Clinical trials for cancer treatment and control will be obtained from ECOG, NSABP, RTOG, MDA, U of M and URCC. Clinical trials will be reviewed and approved for use by the Kalamazoo CCOP investigators and the WMCC Institutional Review Board. Knowledge gained from clinical trials or awareness of new clinical trials will be presented to the community physicians through tumor boards, educational conferences and personal contact. The intended effectiveness of the Kalamazoo CCOP will be carefully monitored on an ongoing basis. It is believed that the continuation and expansion of treatment, prevention and cancer control trials through the Kalamazoo CCOP will contribute measurably to the Healthy People 2010 overall goals of reducing the overall cancer death rate, increasing years of healthy life, increasing the number of individuals screened for cancers, reducing disparities in health care among different population groups and to achieving access to preventive health services, therefore reducing cancer incidence, morbidity and mortality.

"Communicating about Clinical Trials:Bringing the CIS to the Underserved    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Public hospital patients, often of low socioeconomic status and diverse race/ethnicity (the ""underserved""), have few options for understanding and managing their illness, and they are also underrepresented in clinical trials. The National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service (CIS), a source of high quality cancer information for the public has gone largely unused by those most in need. Specific Aims: To provide appropriate clinical trials information to support public hospital patients making informed decisions about their treatment, this study has three specific aims: 1. to assess and document clinical trial information needs of African American, Latino, and White public hospital cancer patients; 2. to assess and adapt the CIS standard of service regarding clinical trial information through modification of current CIS telephone response for low literacy and diverse cultures and development of a proactive telephone protocol to improve caller question asking skills, increase information efficacy, and encourage participation in clinical trials; and 3. To pilot test the new adapted protocol for feasibility and efficacy. Study Design: This study consists of two phases. In Phase 1 multiple qualitative methods will be used to understand clinical trial information needs and to develop and pretest enhanced CIS protocols. We will gain insight into meanings patients attribute to clinical trials and 'research', document language patients use to discuss clinical trials and experimental treatments, and observe effective communications and miscommunications around provider/patient clinical trial information sharing through direct observations and ethnographic interviews. We will adapt/develop culturally appropriate protocols through: i) review of standard CIS clinical trials training; ii) prompted calls by patients to the CIS followed by patient and phone specialist debriefing interviews; and iii) patient focus groups. In Phase II we will pilot test the adapted protocols for feasibility and efficacy using pre- and post-call interviews. The conceptual framework is drawn from Subjective Culture, Informed Decision-making, and Social Learning Theories. Relevance to Public Health: Increasing participation of minorities in clinical trials research has been identified as a means to address cancer disparities. Recent research suggests that minorities are as willing as non-Hispanic whites to participate in clinical research if given appropriate information and opportunity. Building upon a pre-existing, federally funded cancer information resource (CIS), this study aims to bring appropriate cancer clinical trials information to underserved cancer patients and their families who need it the most.

"Florida Hospital Cancer Institute Community Clinical Oncology Program     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seventh Day Adventist Hospital System operates 37 hospitals in 10 states. In Central Florida, the Florida Hospital System has six hospital campuses (that will be participating in the FHCI-CCOP application) that bill under one license. The flagship hospital of the seven Florida Hospital System is Florida Hospital South (FH) located in Orlando, Orange County. Florida Hospital South (FH) offers a full array of services including medical oncology, radiation oncology, pediatric oncology, bone marrow transplantation, surgical oncology, neuro-oncology, and gynecologic oncology. The other five hospitals in Central Florida are located in the neighboring Oscelo and Seminole counties. A seventh hospital Florida Hospital Memorial Medical Center (MMC) is located in Volusia County. MMC is also owned by Adventist Health, but falls under a separate license. The Florida Hospital Cancer Institute (FHCI) was created to coordinate all of the cancer activities in the FH System. Dr. Lee Zehngebot has been leading the clinical activities of the FHCI for over 20 years. Dr. Zehngebot has been the architect of a successful clinical trial within the FHCI. This program has received national awards and recognition. The FHCl's Research department has a strong history of both cooperative group and pharmaceutical trials. Over the last year as we prepared for the transition to a CCOP program, FHCI enrolled CCOP credit equivalents of 56 treatment credits and 54.8 cancer control credits, with the majority of credits accrued since January 2011. In addition, FHCl's catchment area includes counties with over 40% Hispanic population and 20 % African American. While the tumor registry data only shows 11 % Hispanic and 8.5 % African American, enrollment to clinical trials shows 13% Hispanic and 10% African American. The above six hospitals in the FH System along with another MMC wish to become a CCOP. We view a CCOP award as a cornerstone to further integrate our cancer clinical trials and research programs. A CCOP award will allow FHCI to expand its clinical trials efforts in both geography and scope in the central Florida community.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While central Florida has excellent Cancer Center resources, this area lacks the comprehensiveness that a CCOP brings to the community in terms of outreach and clinical trials access.

"Advancing Clinical Trails in Coastal North Carolina     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary mission of the cancer clinical research team from New Hanover Regional Medical Center (NHRMC) and Coastal Carolina Radiation Oncology (CCRO) has been to improve cancer outcomes and decrease cancer burden for the people of Southeastern North Carolina (SENC) utilizing the mechanism of clinical trials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Over the past decade, the group has worked toward that goal via two major five-year Cancer Disparities Research Partnership grants from the NCI. After building a solid clinical research infrastructure, the team has steadily increased enrollment of underserved populations onto treatment trials, followed by cancer control and symptom management trials. The current formation of the proposed SENC CCOP combines NHRMC and CCRO resources for the project, ""Advancing Clinical Trials in Coastal North Carolina"" to sustain and extend the successes achieved in improving cancer outcomes for underserved populations via the CDRP projects to the entire population of SENC. The SENC CCOP plans to annually accrue 80 patients on treatment trials and 70 patients on cancer control studies utilizing offerings from three cooperative groups (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group, Cancer and Leukemia Group B, Gynecologic Oncology Group) and the Wake Forest University CCOP Research Bases. The specific aims of the SENC CCOP are: (1) to improve cancer care for patients diagnosed with malignant disease in coastal North Carolina (NC) (a population to which clinical trials are otherwise unavailable due to significant geographic distance from comprehensive cancer centers) through participation in National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored treatment trials; (2) to build upon prior successes achieved through the Cancer Disparities Research Partnership (CDRP) program by increasing enrollment of underserved populations onto NCI sponsored clinical trials; (3) to reduce the burden of cancer in SENC by increasing accrual to Department of Cancer Prevention (DCP) clinical trials.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   In 2010, 45,000 people were diagnosed and 19,000 died of cancer in North Carolina (NC). Residents of Southeastern NC, a large proportion of whom are African American, poor, or elderly, are disproportionately affected by cancer. The SENC CCOP seeks to decrease this cancer burden in coastal NC by increasing enrollment onto clinical trials for cancer treatment and control sponsored by the National Cancer Institute.              ",Advancing Clinical Trails in Coastal North Carolina,8522471,U10CA176852,"['Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Mission ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' forest ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Radiation Oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' programs ', ' Medical center ', ' success ', ' Controlled Study ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Division of Cancer Prevention ', ' GOG ', ' Gynecologic Oncology Group ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' RTOG ', ' Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' CALGB ', ' Cancer and Leukemia Group B ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' symptom management ', ' treatment trial ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' prevention clinical trial ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NCI,NEW HANOVER REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER,U10,2013,532663,0.060354631668520016
"Beaumont Community Clinical Oncology Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): William Beaumont Hospital (BH), located in the northwest Detroit suburb of Royal Oak, Michigan (1061 beds), in the rapidly growing suburb of Troy, Michigan (361 beds), and the metropolitan setting of Grosse Pointe, Michigan (289 beds), continues to be a highly productive contributor to the NCI's Community Clinical Oncology Program. Against the diverse tri-county backdrop of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties, with a combined population of 4.5 million people, BH diagnoses and cares for over 5000 new cancer cases each year. Beaumont CCOP (B-CCOP) offers over 80 multi-disciplinary investigators in 14 specialty departments to provide this care. Since the renewal of B-CCOP funding in 2005 we have accrued a total of 730.1 treatment credits and 1263.0 cancer control credits for an impressive total of 1993.1 credits, making this a very productive grant period. Current results show strong indications that we will continue this outstanding accrual with the addition of a component site, Botsford Hospital, and the opening of a CCOP site at Beaumont, Grosse Pointe. Our goals remain the same: to increase enrollment of patients to treatment and cancer control studies, carefully following patients and participants currently on study, and to further build our outreach into our diverse communities. The specific aims of the program are to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity and mortality by accelerating the transfer of newly developed cancer prevention therapies, to improve early detection rates, and to facilitate patient treatment management, rehabilitation, and the dissemination of scientific results to the profession and to the general public. To facilitate this process B-CCOP is supported by a central office, an experienced Institutional Review Board, a dedicated investigational pharmacy, and a group of leadership committees commissioned to support protocol review and implementation, financial management and the CCOP goals and direction. Our mission: ""Cancer Clinical Trials Office at Beaumont Hospitals provides research to our community with dignity, compassion, hope and excellence in service"".       RELEVANCE: B-CCOP's goal of increasing community oncologists' involvement in state of the art cancer prevention, control and treatment trials serving a wide segment of our population, including minorities, women, and other underserved populations continues to be relevant today.

"Nemours Community Clinical Oncology Program     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nemours is an internationally recognized children's health system that owns and operates major pediatric specialty clinics in Delaware, Florida, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. Allred I. duPont was one of the most important philanthropists in this country in the early 20th century. Through his vision and generosity he created one of the most important children's health care organizations in the United States -- The Nemours Foundation.  In his will, Mr. duPont created the Alfred I. duPont Testamentary Trust to accomplish 3 things:  Create a Trust which will be funded by the majority of his assets to last into perpetuity; Create a charitable foundation (The Nemours Foundation) devoted to providing health care services to children; To care for his home in Delaware, called Nemours, to benefit the public well into the future.  It is with this background of philanthropy and a commitment to children's health, coupled with over 25 years experience in clinical trials research, that the decision was made to strengthen the participation of Nemours pediatric oncology sites in cooperative group research. As a network of community hospitals and physician practices, application for funding as a Community Clinical Oncology Program was the perfect choice for Nemours Foundation. While Nemours Alfred I. duPont Hospital For Children (Wilmington, DE), Nemours Children's Clinics - Jacksonville, FL, Nemours Children's Hospital (Orlando, FL) and Nemours Children's Clinic -Pensacola, FL all currently participate in or contribute to CCOPs, alignment of the four pediatric programs participating in this grant will provide better development and utilization of pediatric specific resources. Ultimately the Nemours CCOP will permit development of a research infrastructure specific to a Pediatric Research Base, and implementation of pediatric specific quality and outcomes measures. This realignment will further prepare us for future participation in the NCI Community Oncology Research Program as we focus on clinical trial accrual as well as a comprehensive community based oncology program.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is only one Pediatric CCOP currently funded. The Nemours CCOP brings together four components of the Nemours Foundation that w/ill add a more geographically diversified and focused pediatric group to the CCOP family through Nemours network in the community.

"The MB-CCOP at Boston Medical Center The City of Boston is rich with academic medical centers and cancer care facilities. However, these resources have done little to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in cancer mortality, in part due to a lack of minority enrollment in cancer clinical trials. Boston Medical Center (BMC), the largest safety net provider in New England, stands uniquely positioned to implement a Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MB- CCOP) in attempts to reduce this disparity. More than two-thirds of BMC patients are minorities and most are low-income. BMC already has a successful Cancer Clinical Trials Program (CCTP) and a state-of-the-art cancer center that opened in 2006. Established in 1991, the BMC CCTP has developed methods for culturally sensitive outreach, recruitment, enrollment and retention in cancer clinical trials. Our CCTP research nurses have all been trained in patient navigation to help patients overcome their many barriers to care. As a result, minorities now account for 42% of cancer clinical trial enrollment. However, the lack of resources in our CCTP limits the extent to which we can offer our services beyond the confines of the institution into Boston's most impoverished and diverse communities. The MB-CCOP at BMC will provide the resources we need to facilitate access to both BMC's cancer care services and cancer clinical trials by patients receiving primary care in the community. Taking advantage of the experience at BMC with the NCI Patient Navigator Research Program, we will employ a patient navigation model for the BMC MB-CCOP. Navigators will be placed at five of Boston's community health centers (CHCs) to facilitate the communication process and the referral of appropriate patients for evaluation of clinical trials at BMC. At the same time, an MB-CCOP at BMC will provide our oncologists access to a much larger portfolio of cancer clinical trials relevant to the patient population we serve. Our specific aims are: 1) to provide patient navigation for CHC patients to facilitate access to BMC cancer care and clinical trials; 2) to promptly screen all cancer patients for clinical trial participation; 3) to provide outreach and education to community physicians and their patients, and 4) to test the effectiveness of these methods in increasing minority accruals. The overarching goal of the MB-CCOP at BMC is to enhance minority enrollment to cancer clinical trials utilizing community-based patient navigation in an effort to reduce the racial and ethnic disparities of cancer mortality in Boston.",The MB-CCOP at Boston Medical Center,8703979,U10CA139519,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Accounting ', ' Appointment ', ' Awareness ', ' Boston ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancer Care Facilities ', ' Cities ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' New England ', ' Nursing Research ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Oncologist ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Community Physician ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' outreach ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Minority ', ' safety net ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' control trial ', ' patient population ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,U10,2013,501282,0.10606271231949291

The Feist-Weiller Cancer Center was established at the Louisiana State University Health Science Center in Shreveport (LSUHSC-S) to provide multidisciplinary cancer care, and clinical and translational research targeted to the unique population in Northwest La, which will improve the public health by decreasing cancer incidence and deaths. The population was plagued with high rates of poverty, low literacy and low levels of education, little access to modern approaches to prevention, detection, and treatment of cancer, and often presented with late stages of cancer, Fifty-five percent of newly diagnosed cancer patients at LSUHSC-S are African-Americans, With the destruction of Charity and University Hospitals in New Orleans by hurricane Katrina, LSUHSCS is now the only intact tertiary care hospital providing care to the state's indigent population and has become the major site for treatment of patients with leukemia and lymphoma, and those requiring bone marrow transplant. To provide local access to cancer clinical trials for the increased referral area, the FWCC will continue to strengthen and expand its organizational and operational base in order to support a structure to effectively implement a program to provide a multidisciplinary approach to cancer care and prevention for patients referred to the FWCC and in the patients' local communities. The FWCC MB-CCOP has provided access to NCI-sponsored clinical trials and research coordinator support at outlying sites. Education will be provided to community physicians through teleconferencing cancer tumor boards. Outreach programs to educate the indigent and minority population about cancer prevention, screening, and treatment, and clinical trials available through the FWCC MB-CCOP will be conducted with the assistance of the Louisiana Cancer Control Partnership, an organization dedicated to reducing cancer disparities by providing education, screening, referrals, information dissemination, and other resources in the minority and underserved communities. As well, the FWCC Partners in Wellness Free cancer screening program will be utilized to spread this valuable educational information. Since the FWCC has been founded, our approach to cancer has resulted in outcomes at LSUHSC-S at least as good as the national average and far better than Louisiana as a whole which ranks 49th in cancer mortality. The FWCC has a history of greater than 40% minority accrual to SWOG, CTSU, and NCI treatment and prevention studies, as well as industry, in-house, and translational research protocols. Plans to expand minority access and accrual are detailed in this application.

"Real-Time Data Capture of the Experiences of Blacks in Cancer Clinical Trials     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Participation in cancer clinical trials is an effective means of reducing cancer disparities among Black cancer patients because they provide an opportunity to receive high quality health care from leading healthcare providers and researchers.   Much of the research about cancer clinical trial participation among Blacks involves members of the Black community who do not have cancer, or who are not cancer survivors.   It is not known what factors actually influence Black cancer patients to participate and remain in cancer clinical trials.  Moreover, we do not know the day-to-day experiences of Black adults with cancer as they navigate their way through the clinical trial process.  This application proposes a qualitative descriptive study using face-to-face and real-time telephone interviews to identify and describe the factors that Black cancer patients consider important in their decision to participate and remain in research and to provide a rich description of what is actually happening during their clinical research participation. This research is consistent with the mission of NINR to enhance scientific knowledge and reduce health disparities in clinical research.                 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Few Black adults with cancer participate in research.

"PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY EDUCATION (YRS28-32)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pediatric cancer is the leading cause of death in childhood from medical conditions in the US. Thus, pediatric cancer education is important for pediatricians and family medicine physicians, so that cancer can be diagnosed early, when it is most curable. Cancer research is vital to developing cancer cures. The Pediatric Oncology Education (POE) program provides knowledge and experience to motivate promising students to consider careers in cancer research and related areas. Particular attention is given to including students from groups under-represented among oncology scientists and clinicians. Program participants are outstanding pre- doctoral biomedical science and health professions students interested in oncology careers.     All participants are US citizens or permanent residents. Their tenure is 11 weeks (9 weeks for medical students, 10 weeks for returnees). They are matched with a St. Jude faculty mentor with similar research interests and participate in the mentor's ongoing research program. They attend institutional clinical and basic research conferences, as well as a Lunch & Learn series designed specifically for them. They shadow an oncologist and observe in surgery. They give a PowerPoint presentation on their research project in the Lunch & Learn series and submit a project report written in the style of a journal in which their mentor publishes.     The POE program is advertised by word of mouth, our web site, by mail to over 1300 US university science faculty, cancer researchers, medical schools, historically under-represented minority (URM) colleges and universities, and by St Jude Academic Programs recruiters at numerous major scientific meetings (including the major URM science student meetings). Each year, 400 - 500 students apply for the program. The 2010 acceptance rate was 11.1% (51 of 460 applicants), and the class average undergraduate GPA was 3.825. Of 308 participants in 2005-2010, 51 (16.6%) were URM, and 189 (61.3%) were females. Many (21.1% in 2005-2010) return for an additional appointment, thus reinforcing their cancer education and research experience. To date, 1997-2009 program participants are co-authors on 200 peer-reviewed St. Jude publications.     Ongoing assessment and evaluation of the program is provided by pre- and post-experience testing of the student's knowledge of pediatric cancer and related areas, and by post-experience surveys completed by all students and mentors. Experienced cancer educators from prominent cancer centers reviewed the program as on-site consultants in 2005 and 2009. A long-term tracking process is in place. Of the 696 participants who have finished their academic degree work, 596 (85.6%) hold a doctorate, including 146 (76.8%) of 190 URM in the cohort. Of the 893 participants since 1978, 176 (19.7%) have a cancer career goal, and 88 (9.9%) are already in cancer-committed careers. The Program Director reports on the program regularly to the American Association for Cancer Education (AACE). She received the 2009 Margaret Hay Edwards Achievement Medal for sustained outstanding contributions to cancer education, the highest honor bestowed by the AACE.        The Pediatric Oncology Education (POE) Program introduces outstanding biomedical science and health professions students to the latest pediatric cancer research, treatment and prevention approaches. It provides them an opportunity to do high quality, contemporary cancer-related research with a faculty mentor, and encourages them to pursue careers in cancer research and/or cancer patient management.

"Wisconsin NCI Community Oncology Research Program (WiNCORP) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of the Wisconsin NCI Community Oncology Research Program (WiNCORP) is to provide access to NCI-sponsored clinical trials to over 680,000 community members residing within its collective, largely rural, service area spanning most of the state of Wisconsin, upper Michigan and adjacent counties in northern Iowa and Southeastern Minnesota. WiNCORP represents a consortium between three legacy Wisconsin CCOPs in good standing (Gundersen Health Systems, St. Vincent Regional Cancer Center and Marshfield Clinic) who have historically met and exceeded accrual goals, accruing nearly 9,000 subjects in the program's history. WiNCORP's prior track record in accruals to NCI-sponsored clinical trials  and strong historical track record in cancer care delivery research (CCDR) position WiNCORP to apply as a  high performance NCORP site. This alignment of clinical and research infrastructure ideally positions  WiNCORP to promote NCI's vision for NCORP by facilitating NCI trial access for a large, underrepresented  patient population residing in predominantly rural-designated settings and engaging CCDR. Strategically,  WiNCORP seeks expansion in a variety and number of NCI sponsored clinical trials including CCDR to  increase both access and accrual to a rural population largely underrepresented in clinical trials thus  addressing a disparity gap. Specific aims to accomplish these goals include: 1) Conduct NCI phase l/ll, II and III cancer screening, prevention, symptom management, treatment, post-treatment, imaging and quality of life trials across the entire WiNCORP service area. Tasks include expanded educational strategies targeting patients, providers, and the community, with emphasis on minority populations and streamlining recruitment strategies across WiNCORP to promote accrual. 2) Facilitate conduct of Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) across of integrated health care systems through establishment of an expanded research infrastructure. Tasks include establishment of care coordination and navigation teams to facilitate CCDR. 3)  Facilitate accrual to molecular target driven trials. Tasks include engagement of institutional resources and newly established WiNCORP infrastructure to create opportunities for supporting this trial type. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The establishment of WiNCORP will provide opportunities for community members who live in Wisconsin, the upper Michigan peninsula, northeastern Iowa and southeastern Minnesota to access NCI-sponsored clinical trials.

"Montana Cancer Consortium NCORP     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Montana Cancer Consortium (MCC) NCORP Community Site will coordinate, support and improve the  activities of physicians, cancer centers and hospitals across the entire state of Montana, as w/ell as portions of Northern Idaho and Wyoming, to maximize patient access to the highest levels of cancer care, especially  accrual to NCI-sponsored clinical trials. In addition, MCC NCORP will design, participate in and influence cancer care delivery research, helping inform and speed validated care innovations into clinical practice. The region has been characterized as 'mega-rural' with severe access to care due to the vastness of the  geography, lack of university-based treatment and research facilities, and lack of primary care providers. It is also home to seven American Indian Reservations, where issues of poverty, distance, and cultural taboos  surrounding cancer care discussion and treatment create special disparities to prevention, early diagnosis,  treatment and survivorship of cancer. MCC is an independent not-for-profit institution that exists to maximize access to clinical treatment trials and research through centralized services and support for member  physicians and sites that might not otherwise offer access to these critical opportunities. The MCC NCORP Community Site consists of ten member components and six subcomponents that collectively will serve over one million residents in an area covering over 200,000 square miles. Membership includes 53 Board Certified oncologists, virtually every practitioner in the region and their respective hospitals and clinics,  representing all cancer car specialty areas. MCC core staff managed the NCI Community Cancer Oncology Program (CCOP) since 1996 and includes a component site selected as an NCI National Community Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP) since 2007. MCC NCORP is affiliated with five national research bases, and is poised to provide and support expanded access to state-of-the-art cancer treatment, prevention, and control through NCI-sponsored clinical trials while improving the delivery of cancer care through research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The uniquely rural and medically underserved population of Montana, Northern Idaho and Northern Wyoming offers stimulating challenges for implementing NCI-sponsored clinical trials.

"Real-Time Data Capture of the Experiences of Blacks in Cancer Clinical Trials     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Participation in cancer clinical trials is an effective means of reducing cancer disparities among Black cancer patients because they provide an opportunity to receive high quality health care from leading healthcare providers and researchers.   Much of the research about cancer clinical trial participation among Blacks involves members of the Black community who do not have cancer, or who are not cancer survivors.   It is not known what factors actually influence Black cancer patients to participate and remain in cancer clinical trials.  Moreover, we do not know the day-to-day experiences of Black adults with cancer as they navigate their way through the clinical trial process.  This application proposes a qualitative descriptive study using face-to-face and real-time telephone interviews to identify and describe the factors that Black cancer patients consider important in their decision to participate and remain in research and to provide a rich description of what is actually happening during their clinical research participation. This research is consistent with the mission of NINR to enhance scientific knowledge and reduce health disparities in clinical research.                 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Few Black adults with cancer participate in research.

"Northwest NCI Community Oncology Research Program     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer affects 1.6 million Americans in the US each year. Over 37,000 Washington State residents are diagnosed with cancer each year and it has been the overall leading cause of death since 2004. In 2012, cancer was responsible for 12,170 deaths and accounted for approximately 24% of all deaths statewide.  Since 1983, the NCI has extended cancer research into the community and facilitated the translation of research into evidenced based practice through the Community Clinical Oncology Programs (CCOPs). For the past 30 years, cancer patients in the Pacific Northwest have had access to NCI funded oncology clinical  trials via two large community based research networks: Northwest CCOP and Virginia Mason CCOP.  These two highly experienced CCOPs share a 30 year history as separate, but adjacent CCOPs and have joined to form the Northwest NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NW NCORP).  The NW NCORP recognizes the critical contributions that community cancer research programs occupy in clinical research continuum. According to the NCI about 85% of cancer patients are treated in or near their communities. Community hospitals keep patients close to family, friends, and jobs, while treatment at major Cancer Centers may require extended commutes or long stays away from home. Our service orientation and position in the cancer research design-implement-delivery continuum demands collaboration with likeminded community-based entities and modernization of our ability to connect to diverse patient populations  and other stakeholders. With our fundamental principle of clinical research collaboration and cancer care  delivery, the specific aims of the NW NCORP community site are: (1) Accelerate access to clinical trials in  ""real-world"" healthcare delivery settings for cancer patients across the lifespan (pediatrics, adolescent and  young adults, and adults); (2) Build infrastructure for the cancer care delivery research program (CCDR) in  preparation for the capacity to conduct CCDR clinical trials across the NW NCORP Network; and (3)  Develop active strategies for enhancing interaction with NCI-supported programs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a network of community hospitals, clinics, and multidisciplinary providers focused on the entire spectrum of cancer patients (pediatrics to aging adults), the NW NCORP offers a ""real-world"" setting for cancer  patients to access new and emerging medical treatments and supportive care via a national clinical research  network.            ",Northwest NCI Community Oncology Research Program,8790679,UG1CA189952,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Commuting ', ' Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Leadership ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Modernization ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Pacific Northwest ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Technology ', ' United States ', ' Virginia ', ' Washington ', ' Friends ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Communication Tools ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Preparation ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Mind ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' ']",NCI,TACOMA GENERAL HOSPITAL,UG1,2014,1016005,0.0892783382825916
"Florida Hospital Cancer Institute Community Clinical Oncology Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Seventh Day Adventist Hospital System operates 37 hospitals in 10 states. In Central Florida, the Florida Hospital System has six hospital campuses (that will be participating in the FHCI-CCOP application) that bill under one license. The flagship hospital of the seven Florida Hospital System is Florida Hospital South (FH) located in Orlando, Orange County. Florida Hospital South (FH) offers a full array of services including medical oncology, radiation oncology, pediatric oncology, bone marrow transplantation, surgical oncology, neuro-oncology, and gynecologic oncology. The other five hospitals in Central Florida are located in the neighboring Oscelo and Seminole counties. A seventh hospital Florida Hospital Memorial Medical Center (MMC) is located in Volusia County. MMC is also owned by Adventist Health, but falls under a separate license. The Florida Hospital Cancer Institute (FHCI) was created to coordinate all of the cancer activities in the FH System. Dr. Lee Zehngebot has been leading the clinical activities of the FHCI for over 20 years. Dr. Zehngebot has been the architect of a successful clinical trial within the FHCI. This program has received national awards and recognition. The FHCl's Research department has a strong history of both cooperative group and pharmaceutical trials. Over the last year as we prepared for the transition to a CCOP program, FHCI enrolled CCOP credit equivalents of 56 treatment credits and 54.8 cancer control credits, with the majority of credits accrued since January 2011. In addition, FHCl's catchment area includes counties with over 40% Hispanic population and 20 % African American. While the tumor registry data only shows 11 % Hispanic and 8.5 % African American, enrollment to clinical trials shows 13% Hispanic and 10% African American. The above six hospitals in the FH System along with another MMC wish to become a CCOP. We view a CCOP award as a cornerstone to further integrate our cancer clinical trials and research programs. A CCOP award will allow FHCI to expand its clinical trials efforts in both geography and scope in the central Florida community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While central Florida has excellent Cancer Center resources, this area lacks the comprehensiveness that a CCOP brings to the community in terms of outreach and clinical trials access.

"National Initiative for Minority Involvement in Neurological Clinical Trials Poor recruitment and retention of minority populations in clinical research, and clinical trials in particular,  continues to be a significant barrier in the reduction of health disparities. Although we have been successful  we realize that there are few best-practice guidelines which have systematically outlined successful  strategies to promote and sustain successful recruitment and retention of minority populations. This  application was prepared in response to RFA-MD-11-005. NIMHD Resource-Related Minority Health and  Health Disparities Research (U24). This proposal will specifically address focus ""(a) Bioethics Research  Infrastructure Initiative"". Our goal is to integrate and expand existing resources to refine and support a  comprehensive multidisciplinary program to enhance clinical trial recruitment and retention of minority  individuals. This program will be lead by a partnership between the Community Engagement Core Resource  ofthe Irving Institute for Clinical Translational Research (IICTR; UL1 RR024156) and the Northern  Manhattan Center of Excellence in Minority Health and Health Disparities (NOCEMHD; P60 MD000206).

"The MB-CCOP at Boston Medical Center The City of Boston is rich with academic medical centers and cancer care facilities. However, these resources have done little to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in cancer mortality, in part due to a lack of minority enrollment in cancer clinical trials. Boston Medical Center (BMC), the largest safety net provider in New England, stands uniquely positioned to implement a Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MB- CCOP) in attempts to reduce this disparity. More than two-thirds of BMC patients are minorities and most are low-income. BMC already has a successful Cancer Clinical Trials Program (CCTP) and a state-of-the-art cancer center that opened in 2006. Established in 1991, the BMC CCTP has developed methods for culturally sensitive outreach, recruitment, enrollment and retention in cancer clinical trials. Our CCTP research nurses have all been trained in patient navigation to help patients overcome their many barriers to care. As a result, minorities now account for 42% of cancer clinical trial enrollment. However, the lack of resources in our CCTP limits the extent to which we can offer our services beyond the confines of the institution into Boston's most impoverished and diverse communities. The MB-CCOP at BMC will provide the resources we need to facilitate access to both BMC's cancer care services and cancer clinical trials by patients receiving primary care in the community. Taking advantage of the experience at BMC with the NCI Patient Navigator Research Program, we will employ a patient navigation model for the BMC MB-CCOP. Navigators will be placed at five of Boston's community health centers (CHCs) to facilitate the communication process and the referral of appropriate patients for evaluation of clinical trials at BMC. At the same time, an MB-CCOP at BMC will provide our oncologists access to a much larger portfolio of cancer clinical trials relevant to the patient population we serve. Our specific aims are: 1) to provide patient navigation for CHC patients to facilitate access to BMC cancer care and clinical trials; 2) to promptly screen all cancer patients for clinical trial participation; 3) to provide outreach and education to community physicians and their patients, and 4) to test the effectiveness of these methods in increasing minority accruals. The overarching goal of the MB-CCOP at BMC is to enhance minority enrollment to cancer clinical trials utilizing community-based patient navigation in an effort to reduce the racial and ethnic disparities of cancer mortality in Boston.",The MB-CCOP at Boston Medical Center,8896948,U10CA139519,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Accounting ', ' Appointment ', ' Awareness ', ' Boston ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancer Care Facilities ', ' Cities ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' New England ', ' Nursing Research ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Oncologist ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Community Physician ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' outreach ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Minority ', ' safety net ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' control trial ', ' patient population ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,U10,2014,110177,0.10606271231949291

"Northwest NCI Community Oncology Research Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer affects 1.6 million Americans in the US each year. Over 37,000 Washington State residents are diagnosed with cancer each year and it has been the overall leading cause of death since 2004. In 2012, cancer was responsible for 12,170 deaths and accounted for approximately 24% of all deaths statewide.  Since 1983, the NCI has extended cancer research into the community and facilitated the translation of research into evidenced based practice through the Community Clinical Oncology Programs (CCOPs). For the past 30 years, cancer patients in the Pacific Northwest have had access to NCI funded oncology clinical  trials via two large community based research networks: Northwest CCOP and Virginia Mason CCOP.  These two highly experienced CCOPs share a 30 year history as separate, but adjacent CCOPs and have joined to form the Northwest NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NW NCORP).  The NW NCORP recognizes the critical contributions that community cancer research programs occupy in clinical research continuum. According to the NCI about 85% of cancer patients are treated in or near their communities. Community hospitals keep patients close to family, friends, and jobs, while treatment at major Cancer Centers may require extended commutes or long stays away from home. Our service orientation and position in the cancer research design-implement-delivery continuum demands collaboration with likeminded community-based entities and modernization of our ability to connect to diverse patient populations  and other stakeholders. With our fundamental principle of clinical research collaboration and cancer care  delivery, the specific aims of the NW NCORP community site are: (1) Accelerate access to clinical trials in  ""real-world"" healthcare delivery settings for cancer patients across the lifespan (pediatrics, adolescent and  young adults, and adults); (2) Build infrastructure for the cancer care delivery research program (CCDR) in  preparation for the capacity to conduct CCDR clinical trials across the NW NCORP Network; and (3)  Develop active strategies for enhancing interaction with NCI-supported programs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a network of community hospitals, clinics, and multidisciplinary providers focused on the entire spectrum of cancer patients (pediatrics to aging adults), the NW NCORP offers a ""real-world"" setting for cancer  patients to access new and emerging medical treatments and supportive care via a national clinical research  network.",Northwest NCI Community Oncology Research Program,8927723,UG1CA189952,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Commuting ', ' Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Leadership ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Modernization ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Pacific Northwest ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Technology ', ' United States ', ' Virginia ', ' Washington ', ' Friends ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Communication Tools ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Preparation ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Mind ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' ']",NCI,TACOMA GENERAL HOSPITAL,UG1,2014,50000,0.0892783382825916
"Nemours Community Clinical Oncology Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nemours is an internationally recognized children's health system that owns and operates major pediatric specialty clinics in Delaware, Florida, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. Allred I. duPont was one of the most important philanthropists in this country in the early 20th century. Through his vision and generosity he created one of the most important children's health care organizations in the United States -- The Nemours Foundation.  In his will, Mr. duPont created the Alfred I. duPont Testamentary Trust to accomplish 3 things:  Create a Trust which will be funded by the majority of his assets to last into perpetuity; Create a charitable foundation (The Nemours Foundation) devoted to providing health care services to children; To care for his home in Delaware, called Nemours, to benefit the public well into the future.  It is with this background of philanthropy and a commitment to children's health, coupled with over 25 years experience in clinical trials research, that the decision was made to strengthen the participation of Nemours pediatric oncology sites in cooperative group research. As a network of community hospitals and physician practices, application for funding as a Community Clinical Oncology Program was the perfect choice for Nemours Foundation. While Nemours Alfred I. duPont Hospital For Children (Wilmington, DE), Nemours Children's Clinics - Jacksonville, FL, Nemours Children's Hospital (Orlando, FL) and Nemours Children's Clinic -Pensacola, FL all currently participate in or contribute to CCOPs, alignment of the four pediatric programs participating in this grant will provide better development and utilization of pediatric specific resources. Ultimately the Nemours CCOP will permit development of a research infrastructure specific to a Pediatric Research Base, and implementation of pediatric specific quality and outcomes measures. This realignment will further prepare us for future participation in the NCI Community Oncology Research Program as we focus on clinical trial accrual as well as a comprehensive community based oncology program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is only one Pediatric CCOP currently funded. The Nemours CCOP brings together four components of the Nemours Foundation that w/ill add a more geographically diversified and focused pediatric group to the CCOP family through Nemours network in the community.

"Sanford Community Cancer Program of the North Central Plains     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rural communities of the upper Midwest and Central Plains represent a large underserved population for cancer treatment, care delivery and clinical trials. The causes of this difference are multi-factorial but a main obstacle is access to services in rural regional areas. Sanford Health has developed a network of hospitals, cancer centers and clinics to provide high quality multi-disciplinary cancer treatment, clinical trials, ad cancer care delivery to this underserved area. It is hypothesized that this disparity in care for this rural population can be improved by utilizing the organized Sanford Community Cancer Program (SCCP) network community.  This proposal describes the NCI NCORP partnership to help deliver clinical trials and cancer care delivery across the rural area the SCCP serves. This will be accomplished through the following aims:  1. /Maintain and enhance robust accrual to NCI Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) supported clinical trials through our five primary components.  2. Address disparities in clinical trial accrual in underserved and underrepresented populations to increase participation.  3. Cultivate Innovative access points to address barriers to clinical trial accrual through outreach and telemedicine.  4. Develop a Cancer Care Delivery infrastructure.  Through these four aims the Sanford Community Cancer Program will transform implementation of state of the art clinical trials, cancer treatment and cancer care delivery to approximately two million people across parts of five states living in rura America. Many of these people are more than 2 hours from the nearest community cancer center, a situation complicated by 4 to 6 months of harsh weather, which can make travel unpredictable and often dangerous. The ability to provide cancer care, including clinical trials, through outreach and telemedicine to this underserved rural population in their local communities ensures timely, optimal treatment and improved outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: the Sanford Community Cancer Program will continue to offer NCI clinical trials and provide state-of-the-art cancer treatment and cancer care delivery to approximately two million people across six states ability to provide clinical trials through outreach and telemedicine to this underserved rural population of patients increases their opportunity for participation in a trial as a treatment option.

"Wisconsin NCI Community Oncology Research Program (WiNCORP)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of the Wisconsin NCI Community Oncology Research Program (WiNCORP) is to provide access to NCI-sponsored clinical trials to over 680,000 community members residing within its collective, largely rural, service area spanning most of the state of Wisconsin, upper Michigan and adjacent counties in northern Iowa and Southeastern Minnesota. WiNCORP represents a consortium between three legacy Wisconsin CCOPs in good standing (Gundersen Health Systems, St. Vincent Regional Cancer Center and Marshfield Clinic) who have historically met and exceeded accrual goals, accruing nearly 9,000 subjects in the program's history. WiNCORP's prior track record in accruals to NCI-sponsored clinical trials  and strong historical track record in cancer care delivery research (CCDR) position WiNCORP to apply as a  high performance NCORP site. This alignment of clinical and research infrastructure ideally positions  WiNCORP to promote NCI's vision for NCORP by facilitating NCI trial access for a large, underrepresented  patient population residing in predominantly rural-designated settings and engaging CCDR. Strategically,  WiNCORP seeks expansion in a variety and number of NCI sponsored clinical trials including CCDR to  increase both access and accrual to a rural population largely underrepresented in clinical trials thus  addressing a disparity gap. Specific aims to accomplish these goals include: 1) Conduct NCI phase l/ll, II and III cancer screening, prevention, symptom management, treatment, post-treatment, imaging and quality of life trials across the entire WiNCORP service area. Tasks include expanded educational strategies targeting patients, providers, and the community, with emphasis on minority populations and streamlining recruitment strategies across WiNCORP to promote accrual. 2) Facilitate conduct of Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) across of integrated health care systems through establishment of an expanded research infrastructure. Tasks include establishment of care coordination and navigation teams to facilitate CCDR. 3)  Facilitate accrual to molecular target driven trials. Tasks include engagement of institutional resources and newly established WiNCORP infrastructure to create opportunities for supporting this trial type.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The establishment of WiNCORP will provide opportunities for community members who live in Wisconsin, the upper Michigan peninsula, northeastern Iowa and southeastern Minnesota to access NCI-sponsored clinical trials. Establishment of WiNCORP is especially important to remove barriers to participation in cancer trials for members of these largely rural communities.            ",Wisconsin NCI Community Oncology Research Program (WiNCORP),8790842,UG1CA189956,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Biopsy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community HealthTutoring ', ' Community Health Taining ', ' Community Education ', ' Community Health Education ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Iowa ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' Michigan ', ' Minnesota ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' Social Workers ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' surgery specialty ', ' Surgical Profession ', ' Surgical Specialties ', ' survivorship ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Wisconsin ', ' World Health ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' County ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Rural Community ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Regional Cancer ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' case control ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Institution ', ' palliative ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Research Network ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' symptom management ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' virtual ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Navigation System ', ' encryption ', ' tool development ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,MARSHFIELD CLINIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION,UG1,2014,2695248,0.09584648248289655

Community-based pediatric oncologists and other health professionals are pivotal to COG's research mission. NCORP sites provide a means to evaluate advanced treatments administered in community settings. The COG makes available to NCORP sites current treatment protocols with access to investigational agents and special centralized reference laboratories, continuing training and support for NCORP personnel, quality assurance infrastructure, data management and statistical support, thus promoting scientific discovery and high quality cancer care for young persons. The COG is uniquely positioned to elucidate the impact of different health care delivery systems and characteristics on cancer outcomes and identify determinants of poorer outcomes in certain race/ethnic and underserved groups such as adolescents and young adults. Such research will improve outcomes by eliminating disparities and improving efficiencies for the delivery of cancer therapy and follow-up care in young persons.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Children's Oncology Group (COG) is the world's largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and adolescent cancer research. Over 200 leading children's hospitals, universities, and cancer centers across North America participate in COG research, which is focused on developing better treatments and improved quality of life for all children with cancer.            ",COG NCORP Research Base,8790812,UG1CA189955,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Australia ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' information privacy ', ' Confidentiality ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Information Management ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Europe ', ' Goals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' New Zealand ', ' North America ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' survivorship ', ' Training Support ', ' Translating ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Universities ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Data Quality ', ' Radiation Oncology ', ' Funding ', ' pediatric neoplasm/cancer ', ' pediatric malignancy ', ' pediatric cancer ', ' Malignant Pediatric Tumor ', ' Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Childhood Tumor ', ' Childhood Cancers ', ' Malignant Childhood Neoplasm ', ' Pediatric Oncologist ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' data management ', ' health care organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' care delivery ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' GOG ', ' Gynecologic Oncology Group ', ' Human Subject Research ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', "" Children's Oncology Group "", ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Pediatric Oncology ', ' Pediatric Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' health related quality of life ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' public health relevance ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' community setting ', ' patient population ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' ']",NCI,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,UG1,2014,3961235,0.0738749035708045
"Columbia University Minority/Underserved Site NCI Community Oncology Research Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site will be based at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC), the home of cancer research at Columbia University Medical Center in the City of New York. The HICCC, located in Washington Heights where >50% of the local residents are foreign-born, including a large Dominican population, has had a commitment and interest in research and service to this community and to the underserved in general that spans decades, predating its recognition as a national priority. Our specific objectives are: 1) to provide a menu of NCl-sponsored Cooperative Group trials to our investigators, including those in the local medical community, for screening, prevention, cancer control, and treatments; 2) to establish close relationships with the NCI Clinical Cooperative Groups to enhance the benefits of clinical research, especially in cancer care delivery research; 3) to attract and educate potential study participants, especially minorities, about participation in cancer clinical research; 4) expand the HICCC Cancer Prevention, Control and Disparities program's current focus on quality of care of cancer, especially as related to disparities of race/ethnicity, age, income, insurance and other factors. Through utilization of the existing HICCC shared resources, Recruitment and Retention of Minorities Office and Clinical Protocol and Data Management Office, 3267 subjects including 2681 minority participants, have been recruited to NCI or externally peer reviewed studies in the past 5 years. With a NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site award, outreach to a broader range of participants will be expanded by 1) supporting recruitment to a wider range of oncology subspecialty trials, especially given the planned expansion of clinical oncology services and 2) allow activation of more cancer control/prevention studies. This will facilitate a comprehensive approach across the disease and age spectrum, and across treatments, and will facilitate the prioritization of cancer care delivery research studies, in conjunction with the scientific expertise available at HICCC. As such, the range of organ/site specialties for which we provide services to investigators will be broadened thus allowing enrollment of still more minority patients in a wider range of cancer research trials. RELEVANCE (See instructions);  The goal of this study is to reduce the burden of cancer for the minority population in our catchment area.

The MBCCOP established by the LSU School of Medicine in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO-MBCCOP) and its NCCCP partner, the Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center - Our Lady of the Lake Hospital (MBP-OLOL) in Baton Rouge, have joined the MBCCOP at the LSU School of Medicine in Shreveport (LSUHSC-SH-MBCCOP) in northwest Louisiana to create the GS-MB-NCORP. This consortium integrates well-established and experienced teams of clinicians and researchers with the aim of expanding access to state-of-the-art cancer clinical trials to the patients we serve, through a network of leading academic and community hospitals. Louisiana has one of the poorest survival rates for cancer patients in the United States, despite not having the highest incidence for all types of the disease. This is particularly true for underserved and minority patients, clealy reflecting a major health disparity. Possible explanations for this disparity range from socio-economic and access to health care, to poorly understood genetic and biological differences. The LSU MBCCOPs and the NCCCP at MBP-OLOL have independently worked to increase access to clinical trials for minority and underserved communities, establish outreach and education programs, and expand Cancer Care Delivery Research and Health Disparity studies. In the fall of 2012, we agreed to combine our strengths and experience into the GS-MB-NCORP with the goal of having a more significant impact on cancer associated health disparities by integrating our clinical trials programs and incorporating Cancer Care Delivery and Health Disparity researchers into the clinical trials process. The GS-MB-NCORP's goals are to increase the participation of minorities and underserved populations in clinical trials, identify barriers t participation, and incorporate the community in the research studies. To achieve this, we propose the following Specific Aims. 1) Advance an integrated system of access to cancer clinical trials that promote and facilitate the participation and enrollment of patients, in particlar underserved and minority populations in Louisiana. 2) Promote Cancer Care Delivery Research Programs to ensure our ability to participate in research initiatives proposed by the Research Bases, and eventually design protocols that improve the care of our patients. 3) Expand Health Disparities Research programs through community engagement to increase the participation of minority and underserved populations in clinical trials             The GS-MB-NCORP will contribute significantly to the agenda o fthe National Cancer Institute and the  Research Bases, by increasing access to prevention, early detection and cutting edge clinical trials to  minority and underserved patients in Louisiana. It will further enhance the biomedical and clinical workforce  in our state by increasing the number of professionals experienced in conducting health disparities research,  developing cancer care delivery capabilities and implementing advanced clinical trials.",Gulf South Minority-based NCI Community Oncology Research Program,8790613,UG1CA189854,"['Avian ', ' Aves ', ' Birds ', ' Budgets ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Louisiana ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Funding ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' data management ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' human subject protection ', ' Sampling ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' community based participatory research ', ' clinical practice ', ' operation ', ' ']",NCI,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,UG1,2014,1148488,0.15520186781455003

"Alliance NCORP Research Base DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Alliance NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base conducts interventional and observational clinical trials as well as database analyses addressing important questions concerning cancer prevention, screening, symptom intervention, post-treatment surveillance/survivorship, quality of life and cancer care delivery. We place special emphasis upon issues affecting minority, underserved and elderly patient groups, and upon building strong collegial relationships with NCORP Community sites and Minority/Underserved Community sites. The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance), one of the five National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) groups, serves as the coordinating center for the conduct of all NCORP Research Base trials. The Alliance members represent community practices and academic medical centers in approximately equal number, so the results of the trials broadly reflect the actual experience of patients across the United States. In order to improve our understanding of the biological basis of cancer risk and pre-malignant disease, biomarkers that detect pre-symptomatic newly diagnosed or recurrent malignancies, as well as the physiologic mechanisms of cancer-related symptoms and treatment-related toxicities, most of our clinical trials include translational research questions requiring the collection of tumor tissue, premalignant tissue samples, blood, or other human biospecimens. These biospecimens create an invaluable repository for understanding the associations between laboratory and clinical observations. The Alliance NCORP Research Base collaborates broadly with other NCORP Research Bases to enroll patients in trials, conduct translational studies, and share data and biospecimens for pooled analyses. We also collaborate broadly with other NCI-funded investigators and consortia, as well as investigators supported through non-NCI sources. Results of Alliance investigator efforts have resulted in more than 99 abstracts and manuscripts over the past five years, many resulting in significant beneficial changes in clinical practice. The scientific questions answered by the Alliance NCORP Research Base represent meaningful and innovative contributions to biomedical sciences, and can only be addressed through a publicly-funded research network. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately one in three women and one in two men in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime. Research to prevent cancer, detect cancer while it is still curable, improve symptoms related to cancer and its treatment, and enhance cancer care delivery strategies will provide major health and economic benefits for Americans and people around the world.",Alliance NCORP Research Base,8790220,UG1CA189823,"['abstracting ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' geriatric screening ', ' Elderly Assessment ', ' Geriatric Assessment ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Solutions ', ' survivorship ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Organizational Change ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Genetic ', ' Staging ', ' Companions ', ' tool ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' repository ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Recurrent Malignant Tumor ', ' Recurrent Cancer ', ' Recurrent Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Data ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Premalignant ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Community Practice ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' decline in function ', ' functional decline ', ' health economics ', ' effectiveness research ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' improved functioning ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' translational study ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' population health ', ' sharing data ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,UG1,2014,9630271,0.11086243156697383

"Columbia University Minority/Underserved Site NCI Community Oncology Research Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site will be based at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC), the home of cancer research at Columbia University Medical Center in the City of New York. The HICCC, located in Washington Heights where >50% of the local residents are foreign-born, including a large Dominican population, has had a commitment and interest in research and service to this community and to the underserved in general that spans decades, predating its recognition as a national priority. Our specific objectives are: 1) to provide a menu of NCl-sponsored Cooperative Group trials to our investigators, including those in the local medical community, for screening, prevention, cancer control, and treatments; 2) to establish close relationships with the NCI Clinical Cooperative Groups to enhance the benefits of clinical research, especially in cancer care delivery research; 3) to attract and educate potential study participants, especially minorities, about participation in cancer clinical research; 4) expand the HICCC Cancer Prevention, Control and Disparities program's current focus on quality of care of cancer, especially as related to disparities of race/ethnicity, age, income, insurance and other factors. Through utilization of the existing HICCC shared resources, Recruitment and Retention of Minorities Office and Clinical Protocol and Data Management Office, 3267 subjects including 2681 minority participants, have been recruited to NCI or externally peer reviewed studies in the past 5 years. With a NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site award, outreach to a broader range of participants will be expanded by 1) supporting recruitment to a wider range of oncology subspecialty trials, especially given the planned expansion of clinical oncology services and 2) allow activation of more cancer control/prevention studies. This will facilitate a comprehensive approach across the disease and age spectrum, and across treatments, and will facilitate the prioritization of cancer care delivery research studies, in conjunction with the scientific expertise available at HICCC. As such, the range of organ/site specialties for which we provide services to investigators will be broadened thus allowing enrollment of still more minority patients in a wider range of cancer research trials. RELEVANCE (See instructions);  The goal of this study is to reduce the burden of cancer for the minority population in our catchment area.  We plan to use outreach to educate our population about clinical research and prevention, cancer control,  and supportive care along with cancer trials to improve the health of the community.

"Wisconsin NCI Community Oncology Research Program (WiNCORP) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of the Wisconsin NCI Community Oncology Research Program (WiNCORP) is to provide access to NCI-sponsored clinical trials to over 680,000 community members residing within its collective, largely rural, service area spanning most of the state of Wisconsin, upper Michigan and adjacent counties in northern Iowa and Southeastern Minnesota. WiNCORP represents a consortium between three legacy Wisconsin CCOPs in good standing (Gundersen Health Systems, St. Vincent Regional Cancer Center and Marshfield Clinic) who have historically met and exceeded accrual goals, accruing nearly 9,000 subjects in the program's history. WiNCORP's prior track record in accruals to NCI-sponsored clinical trials  and strong historical track record in cancer care delivery research (CCDR) position WiNCORP to apply as a  high performance NCORP site. This alignment of clinical and research infrastructure ideally positions  WiNCORP to promote NCI's vision for NCORP by facilitating NCI trial access for a large, underrepresented  patient population residing in predominantly rural-designated settings and engaging CCDR. Strategically,  WiNCORP seeks expansion in a variety and number of NCI sponsored clinical trials including CCDR to  increase both access and accrual to a rural population largely underrepresented in clinical trials thus  addressing a disparity gap. Specific aims to accomplish these goals include: 1) Conduct NCI phase l/ll, II and III cancer screening, prevention, symptom management, treatment, post-treatment, imaging and quality of life trials across the entire WiNCORP service area. Tasks include expanded educational strategies targeting patients, providers, and the community, with emphasis on minority populations and streamlining recruitment strategies across WiNCORP to promote accrual. 2) Facilitate conduct of Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) across of integrated health care systems through establishment of an expanded research infrastructure. Tasks include establishment of care coordination and navigation teams to facilitate CCDR. 3)  Facilitate accrual to molecular target driven trials. Tasks include engagement of institutional resources and newly established WiNCORP infrastructure to create opportunities for supporting this trial type. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The establishment of WiNCORP will provide opportunities for community members who live in Wisconsin, the upper Michigan peninsula, northeastern Iowa and southeastern Minnesota to access NCI-sponsored clinical trials.

"Alliance NCORP Research Base DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Alliance NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base conducts interventional and observational clinical trials as well as database analyses addressing important questions concerning cancer prevention, screening, symptom intervention, post-treatment surveillance/survivorship, quality of life and cancer care delivery. We place special emphasis upon issues affecting minority, underserved and elderly patient groups, and upon building strong collegial relationships with NCORP Community sites and Minority/Underserved Community sites. The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance), one of the five National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) groups, serves as the coordinating center for the conduct of all NCORP Research Base trials. The Alliance members represent community practices and academic medical centers in approximately equal number, so the results of the trials broadly reflect the actual experience of patients across the United States. In order to improve our understanding of the biological basis of cancer risk and pre-malignant disease, biomarkers that detect pre-symptomatic newly diagnosed or recurrent malignancies, as well as the physiologic mechanisms of cancer-related symptoms and treatment-related toxicities, most of our clinical trials include translational research questions requiring the collection of tumor tissue, premalignant tissue samples, blood, or other human biospecimens. These biospecimens create an invaluable repository for understanding the associations between laboratory and clinical observations. The Alliance NCORP Research Base collaborates broadly with other NCORP Research Bases to enroll patients in trials, conduct translational studies, and share data and biospecimens for pooled analyses. We also collaborate broadly with other NCI-funded investigators and consortia, as well as investigators supported through non-NCI sources. Results of Alliance investigator efforts have resulted in more than 99 abstracts and manuscripts over the past five years, many resulting in significant beneficial changes in clinical practice.

"Montana Cancer Consortium NCORP DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Montana Cancer Consortium (MCC) NCORP Community Site will coordinate, support and improve the  activities of physicians, cancer centers and hospitals across the entire state of Montana, as w/ell as portions of Northern Idaho and Wyoming, to maximize patient access to the highest levels of cancer care, especially  accrual to NCI-sponsored clinical trials. In addition, MCC NCORP will design, participate in and influence cancer care delivery research, helping inform and speed validated care innovations into clinical practice. The region has been characterized as 'mega-rural' with severe access to care due to the vastness of the  geography, lack of university-based treatment and research facilities, and lack of primary care providers. It is also home to seven American Indian Reservations, where issues of poverty, distance, and cultural taboos  surrounding cancer care discussion and treatment create special disparities to prevention, early diagnosis,  treatment and survivorship of cancer. MCC is an independent not-for-profit institution that exists to maximize access to clinical treatment trials and research through centralized services and support for member  physicians and sites that might not otherwise offer access to these critical opportunities. The MCC NCORP Community Site consists of ten member components and six subcomponents that collectively will serve over one million residents in an area covering over 200,000 square miles. Membership includes 53 Board Certified oncologists, virtually every practitioner in the region and their respective hospitals and clinics,  representing all cancer car specialty areas. MCC core staff managed the NCI Community Cancer Oncology Program (CCOP) since 1996 and includes a component site selected as an NCI National Community Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP) since 2007. MCC NCORP is affiliated with five national research bases, and is poised to provide and support expanded access to state-of-the-art cancer treatment, prevention, and control through NCI-sponsored clinical trials while improving the delivery of cancer care through research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The uniquely rural and medically underserved population of Montana, Northern Idaho and Northern Wyoming offers stimulating challenges for implementing NCI-sponsored clinical trials.

"Gulf South Minority-based NCI Community Oncology Research Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Gulf South-Minority Based-NCI Community Oncology Research Program (GS-MB-NCORP) brings together an integrated clinical trials program from two Minority Based CCOPs (MBCCOP) and an NCCCP site in the state of Louisiana, supported by well-established and funded Cancer Care Delivery Research and programs in Health Disparities and Community-Based Participatory Research. The MBCCOP established by the LSU School of Medicine in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO-MBCCOP) and its NCCCP partner, the Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center - Our Lady of the Lake Hospital (MBP-OLOL) in Baton Rouge, have joined the MBCCOP at the LSU School of Medicine in Shreveport (LSUHSC-SH-MBCCOP) in northwest Louisiana to create the GS-MB-NCORP. This consortium integrates well-established and experienced teams of clinicians and researchers with the aim of expanding access to state-of-the-art cancer clinical trials to the patients we serve, through a network of leading academic and community hospitals. Louisiana has one of the poorest survival rates for cancer patients in the United States, despite not having the highest incidence for all types of the disease. This is particularly true for underserved and minority patients, clealy reflecting a major health disparity. Possible explanations for this disparity range from socio-economic and access to health care, to poorly understood genetic and biological differences. The LSU MBCCOPs and the NCCCP at MBP-OLOL have independently worked to increase access to clinical trials for minority and underserved communities, establish outreach and education programs, and expand Cancer Care Delivery Research and Health Disparity studies. In the fall of 2012, we agreed to combine our strengths and experience into the GS-MB-NCORP with the goal of having a more significant impact on cancer associated health disparities by integrating our clinical trials programs and incorporating Cancer Care Delivery and Health Disparity researchers into the clinical trials process. The GS-MB-NCORP's goals are to increase the participation of minorities and underserved populations in clinical trials, identify barriers t participation, and incorporate the community in the research studies. To achieve this, we propose the following Specific Aims. 1) Advance an integrated system of access to cancer clinical trials that promote and facilitate the participation and enrollment of patients, in particlar underserved and minority populations in Louisiana. 2) Promote Cancer Care Delivery Research Programs to ensure our ability to participate in research initiatives proposed by the Research Bases, and eventually design protocols that improve the care of our patients. 3) Expand Health Disparities Research programs through community engagement to increase the participation of minority and underserved populations in clinical trials The GS-MB-NCORP will contribute significantly to the agenda o fthe National Cancer Institute and the  Research Bases, by increasing access to prevention, early detection and cutting edge clinical trials to  minority and underserved patients in Louisiana. It will further enhance the biomedical and clinical workforce  in our state by increasing the number of professionals experienced in conducting health disparities research,  developing cancer care delivery capabilities and implementing advanced clinical trials.",Gulf South Minority-based NCI Community Oncology Research Program,8901096,UG1CA189854,"['Avian ', ' Aves ', ' Birds ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Louisiana ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Funding ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' Sampling ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' community based participatory research ', ' clinical practice ', ' ']",NCI,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,UG1,2015,1188988,0.15502515471558062

"Medical University of South Carolina NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Medical University of South Carolina/Hollings Cancer Center (MUSC/HCC), a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated cancer center since 2009, has been a long-standing NCI cooperative group participant and is well positioned to be a leading Minority/Underserved Community Site within the NCI's Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP). Originally a main member of CALGB (1985-2002), in 2002 MUSC/HCC became a main member of SWOG. In subsequent years, MUSC/HCC became a main member of COG, RTOG, ACoSOG, ACRIN, NSABP and is also an affiliate member of GOG. The overall growth in accrual across all of these NCI sponsored programs has been significant with 134 enrollments in the most recent annual reporting period, of which 28% were ethnic/racial minorities. A major asset that MUSC/HCC and its partnering sites - MUSC/HCC East Cooper, MUSC/HCC North Charleston, Ralph H. Johnson Veterans Administration Medical Center, MUSC/Hilton Head Breast Health Center, Georgetown Health System, and Self Regional Healthcare - bring to the NCORP is its demonstrable ability to reach an ethnic/minority cancer population (32% in its catchment area) and a federally designated underserved/rural cancer population (43% in its catchment area). Another major asset that MUSC/HCC brings to the NCORP program is its considerable expertise and leadership in the development and implementation of cancer disparities and cancer care delivery research (CCDR). MUSC/HCC investigators have a robust portfolio of NCI and other peer-reviewed funded initiatives in these focal areas, enrolling more than 500 individuals in the last year, and are poised to collaborate with NCORP research bases in the development and implementation of additional CCDR research. Finally, MUSC/HCC has invested considerable resources to its centralized clinical research operation. It is capable of managing a large portfolio of studies and has repeatedly demonstrated high quality compliance and data through its external audits during the past decade. The MUSC/HCC Clinical Trials Office will provide an effective and efficient infrastructure to support investigators and clinicians in implementing clinical trials and CCDR within the NCORP. Establishing MUSC/HCC as a Minority/Underserved Community Site within the NCI's Community Oncology  Research Program (NCORP) will provide greater emphasis and availability for residents and healthcare  providers of South Carolina to participate in cancer prevention, control, screening, post treatment  surveillance, cancer care delivery, treatment, and imaging research studies.",Medical University of South Carolina NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site,8901090,UG1CA189848,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' South Carolina ', ' Veterans Affairs (U.S.) ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Survivors ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer care ', ' Annual Reports ', ' Provider ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' GOG ', ' Gynecologic Oncology Group ', ' International ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NSABP ', ' National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project ', ' Qualifying ', ' RTOG ', ' Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' ACRIN ', ' American College of Radiology Imaging Network ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Research Program ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' CALGB ', ' Cancer and Leukemia Group B ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Collection ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' SWOG ', ' Southwest Oncology Group ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' active method ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' minority health ', ' tobacco control ', ' treatment trial ', ' health related quality of life ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' medically underserved ', ' community based participatory research ', ' service utilization ', ' community setting ', ' operation ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,UG1,2015,679181,0.06437758043732816
"Recruiting underserved populations into clinical trials with customizable media ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Racial and ethnic minorities, older adults and those from rural communities continue to be underrepresented in cancer and other clinical trials research, despite annual spending on patient recruitment in excess of $1 billion. While many individual studies have demonstrated that targeted outreach and education to underrepresented patients and engagement of front line providers in community hospitals can help boost participation in clinical trials, few of these strategies have evolved into scalable systems that cn support recruitment efforts across many organizations simultaneously with demonstrated efficacy. MIYO (Make It Your Own) is an online tool that addresses this challenge. MIYO helps healthcare organizations develop and use professional quality recruitment materials to increase research participation among underrepresented groups. In minutes, organizations can create their own versions of audience- tested small media for the specific patients they serve by choosing from a menu of approaches recommended by the Guide to Community Preventive Services, then customizing them by choosing from a library of images, messages and graphic designs. Creations can be printed, e- mailed, texted, used online or distributed in other ways to target audiences. In a wide range of Phase I equivalent studies, MIYO has been used to promote HPV vaccination, use of tobacco quit lines, colorectal cancer screening, and use of clinical trials recruitment materials. Findings from this research shows that MIYO is well liked and easy to use; helpful in designing outreach and education products that are targeted for vulnerable population sub-groups, and effective in increasing audience responses like a calling 1-800-4-CANCER. The proposed Direct to Phase II study will expand the Clinical Trials Participation module in MIYO and evaluate its effectiveness in getting patients to enter Pioneers, a research recruitment registry. In partnership with the Midwest Cancer Alliance, we will randomize its 22 community hospital and health center members to either an active MIYO condition or delayed use control, and compare rates of enrollment overall and in priority sub-groups 12 months pre- and post-implementation of MIYO. Increased and more diverse participation in clinical trials will improve the lives of cancer patients and their families, and elp eliminate cancer health disparities in the U.S. population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The burden of cancer on U.S. adults is tremendous and disproportionate among certain population sub-groups. Clinical trials are one of the main pathways to reducing that burden, but participation rates are low, especially among those most affected by cancer. Our study will examine the uptake and effects of an online tool to help healthcare organizations develop and use evidence-based, professional quality recruitment materials to increase research participation in underrepresented groups.            ",Recruiting underserved populations into clinical trials with customizable media,8832588,R44CA192442,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Electronics ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Investments ', ' Judgment ', ' Libraries ', ' Literature ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Printing ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Rural Community ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' uptake ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Services ', ' member ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' response ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Characteristics ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' treatment site ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' phase II study ', ' phase 2 study ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' ']",NCI,"HEALTH COMMUNICATION IMPACT, LLC",R44,2015,507391,0.05292133595114834

"PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY EDUCATION (YRS28-32) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pediatric cancer is the leading cause of death in childhood from medical conditions in the US. Thus, pediatric cancer education is important for pediatricians and family medicine physicians, so that cancer can be diagnosed early, when it is most curable. Cancer research is vital to developing cancer cures. The Pediatric Oncology Education (POE) program provides knowledge and experience to motivate promising students to consider careers in cancer research and related areas. Particular attention is given to including students from groups under-represented among oncology scientists and clinicians. Program participants are outstanding pre- doctoral biomedical science and health professions students interested in oncology careers.     All participants are US citizens or permanent residents. Their tenure is 11 weeks (9 weeks for medical students, 10 weeks for returnees). They are matched with a St. Jude faculty mentor with similar research interests and participate in the mentor's ongoing research program. They attend institutional clinical and basic research conferences, as well as a Lunch & Learn series designed specifically for them. They shadow an oncologist and observe in surgery. They give a PowerPoint presentation on their research project in the Lunch & Learn series and submit a project report written in the style of a journal in which their mentor publishes.     The POE program is advertised by word of mouth, our web site, by mail to over 1300 US university science faculty, cancer researchers, medical schools, historically under-represented minority (URM) colleges and universities, and by St Jude Academic Programs recruiters at numerous major scientific meetings (including the major URM science student meetings). Each year, 400 - 500 students apply for the program. The 2010 acceptance rate was 11.1% (51 of 460 applicants), and the class average undergraduate GPA was 3.825. Of 308 participants in 2005-2010, 51 (16.6%) were URM, and 189 (61.3%) were females. Many (21.1% in 2005-2010) return for an additional appointment, thus reinforcing their cancer education and research experience. To date, 1997-2009 program participants are co-authors on 200 peer-reviewed St. Jude publications.     Ongoing assessment and evaluation of the program is provided by pre- and post-experience testing of the student's knowledge of pediatric cancer and related areas, and by post-experience surveys completed by all students and mentors. Experienced cancer educators from prominent cancer centers reviewed the program as on-site consultants in 2005 and 2009. A long-term tracking process is in place. Of the 696 participants who have finished their academic degree work, 596 (85.6%) hold a doctorate, including 146 (76.8%) of 190 URM in the cohort. Of the 893 participants since 1978, 176 (19.7%) have a cancer career goal, and 88 (9.9%) are already in cancer-committed careers. The Program Director reports on the program regularly to the American Association for Cancer Education (AACE). She received the 2009 Margaret Hay Edwards Achievement Medal for sustained outstanding contributions to cancer education, the highest honor bestowed by the AACE. The Pediatric Oncology Education (POE) Program introduces outstanding biomedical science and health professions students to the latest pediatric cancer research, treatment and prevention approaches.

"Northwest NCI Community Oncology Research Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer affects 1.6 million Americans in the US each year. Over 37,000 Washington State residents are diagnosed with cancer each year and it has been the overall leading cause of death since 2004. In 2012, cancer was responsible for 12,170 deaths and accounted for approximately 24% of all deaths statewide.  Since 1983, the NCI has extended cancer research into the community and facilitated the translation of research into evidenced based practice through the Community Clinical Oncology Programs (CCOPs). For the past 30 years, cancer patients in the Pacific Northwest have had access to NCI funded oncology clinical  trials via two large community based research networks: Northwest CCOP and Virginia Mason CCOP.  These two highly experienced CCOPs share a 30 year history as separate, but adjacent CCOPs and have joined to form the Northwest NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NW NCORP).  The NW NCORP recognizes the critical contributions that community cancer research programs occupy in clinical research continuum. According to the NCI about 85% of cancer patients are treated in or near their communities. Community hospitals keep patients close to family, friends, and jobs, while treatment at major Cancer Centers may require extended commutes or long stays away from home. Our service orientation and position in the cancer research design-implement-delivery continuum demands collaboration with likeminded community-based entities and modernization of our ability to connect to diverse patient populations  and other stakeholders. With our fundamental principle of clinical research collaboration and cancer care  delivery, the specific aims of the NW NCORP community site are: (1) Accelerate access to clinical trials in  ""real-world"" healthcare delivery settings for cancer patients across the lifespan (pediatrics, adolescent and  young adults, and adults); (2) Build infrastructure for the cancer care delivery research program (CCDR) in  preparation for the capacity to conduct CCDR clinical trials across the NW NCORP Network; and (3)  Develop active strategies for enhancing interaction with NCI-supported programs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a network of community hospitals, clinics, and multidisciplinary providers focused on the entire spectrum of cancer patients (pediatrics to aging adults), the NW NCORP offers a ""real-world"" setting for cancer  patients to access new and emerging medical treatments and supportive care via a national clinical research  network.",Northwest NCI Community Oncology Research Program,8901108,UG1CA189952,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Commuting ', ' Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Leadership ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Modernization ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Pacific Northwest ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Technology ', ' United States ', ' Virginia ', ' Washington ', ' Friends ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Communication Tools ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Preparation ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Mind ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' ']",NCI,TACOMA GENERAL HOSPITAL,UG1,2015,926313,0.0892783382825916

"Sanford Community Cancer Program of the North Central Plains DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rural communities of the upper Midwest and Central Plains represent a large underserved population for cancer treatment, care delivery and clinical trials. The causes of this difference are multi-factorial but a main obstacle is access to services in rural regional areas. Sanford Health has developed a network of hospitals, cancer centers and clinics to provide high quality multi-disciplinary cancer treatment, clinical trials, ad cancer care delivery to this underserved area. It is hypothesized that this disparity in care for this rural population can be improved by utilizing the organized Sanford Community Cancer Program (SCCP) network community.  This proposal describes the NCI NCORP partnership to help deliver clinical trials and cancer care delivery across the rural area the SCCP serves. This will be accomplished through the following aims:  1. /Maintain and enhance robust accrual to NCI Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) supported clinical trials through our five primary components.  2. Address disparities in clinical trial accrual in underserved and underrepresented populations to increase participation.  3. Cultivate Innovative access points to address barriers to clinical trial accrual through outreach and telemedicine.  4. Develop a Cancer Care Delivery infrastructure.  Through these four aims the Sanford Community Cancer Program will transform implementation of state of the art clinical trials, cancer treatment and cancer care delivery to approximately two million people across parts of five states living in rura America. Many of these people are more than 2 hours from the nearest community cancer center, a situation complicated by 4 to 6 months of harsh weather, which can make travel unpredictable and often dangerous. The ability to provide cancer care, including clinical trials, through outreach and telemedicine to this underserved rural population in their local communities ensures timely, optimal treatment and improved outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: the Sanford Community Cancer Program will continue to offer NCI clinical trials and provide state-of-the-art cancer treatment and cancer care delivery to approximately two million people across six states ability to provide clinical trials through outreach and telemedicine to this underserved rural population of patients increases their opportunity for participation in a trial as a treatment option.

"Columbus NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need for high quality cancer care in the United States is ever increasing, but the system is in distress.  An aging population will increase demand for services at a at time when rising costs, uneven accessibility,  anticipated workforce shortages and a lack of evidence based cancer care delivery solutions have put the  system into crisis. This was the conclusion of an Institute of Medicine (lOM) committee report which recently published a number of recommendations in ""Delivering High-Quality Cancer Care: Charting a New Course for a System in Crisis"", Washington DC, National Academies Press, 2013"". The important role for clinical trials especially in the area of comparative effectiveness research, an the translation of results into clinical practice was emphasized by the lOM committee. The new National Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) is poised to engage this recommendation and the Columbus CCOP/NCORP with our experience in cancer care delivery research and educational programs to translate research results to care-givers is uniquely suited to this task. We have continued our reputation for innovation by adapting our existing infrastructure in the design of an integrated cancer care delivery research program involving our 3 major hospitals, coordinated by a team headed by a physician with experience in this area. Our history of extensive community interactions will enhance this effort. The Columbus CCOP/NCORP is indeed ready to join with the NCORP as we forge an innovative evidence-based, patient-centered cancer care delivery system. We are proud of our success in the past and look forward to a bright future as the Columbus NCORP. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although great strides have been made, there is a continuing need for the improved and efficient delivery of cancer care based on solid evidence obtained from well-designed clinical research trials.

"Montana Cancer Consortium NCORP DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Montana Cancer Consortium (MCC) NCORP Community Site will coordinate, support and improve the  activities of physicians, cancer centers and hospitals across the entire state of Montana, as w/ell as portions of Northern Idaho and Wyoming, to maximize patient access to the highest levels of cancer care, especially  accrual to NCI-sponsored clinical trials. In addition, MCC NCORP will design, participate in and influence cancer care delivery research, helping inform and speed validated care innovations into clinical practice. The region has been characterized as 'mega-rural' with severe access to care due to the vastness of the  geography, lack of university-based treatment and research facilities, and lack of primary care providers. It is also home to seven American Indian Reservations, where issues of poverty, distance, and cultural taboos  surrounding cancer care discussion and treatment create special disparities to prevention, early diagnosis,  treatment and survivorship of cancer. MCC is an independent not-for-profit institution that exists to maximize access to clinical treatment trials and research through centralized services and support for member  physicians and sites that might not otherwise offer access to these critical opportunities. The MCC NCORP Community Site consists of ten member components and six subcomponents that collectively will serve over one million residents in an area covering over 200,000 square miles. Membership includes 53 Board Certified oncologists, virtually every practitioner in the region and their respective hospitals and clinics,  representing all cancer car specialty areas. MCC core staff managed the NCI Community Cancer Oncology Program (CCOP) since 1996 and includes a component site selected as an NCI National Community Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP) since 2007. MCC NCORP is affiliated with five national research bases, and is poised to provide and support expanded access to state-of-the-art cancer treatment, prevention, and control through NCI-sponsored clinical trials while improving the delivery of cancer care through research.

"VCU Massey Cancer Center Minority Based NCI Community Oncology Research Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Massey Cancer Center (MCC) will serve as the primary component site for an NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site (MB-NCORP) UM-1 award in partnership with nine collaborating community component sites. The overall objectives of this partnership are to extend novel, innovative, and effective minority recruitment approaches to an expanded base of community component sites, increase opportunities for minority and medically underserved individuals to participate in Cancer Clinical Trial Research (CCTR), and to integrate Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) into the overall MB-NCORP. Accordingly, the specific aims of this proposal are to (1) establish a research infrastructure that will further enable community component sites to conduct CCTR with an emphasis on trials relevant to minority and medically underserved populations, (2) conduct NCI-approved CCTR at the MCC primary component site and throughout the community component sites, and (3) integrate Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) into the overall MB-NCORP. The research design of the MB-NCORP offers a full menu of cancer studies including those in cancer prevention and control, screening, treatment, imaging, and CCDR. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of the NCI as MCC and the community component sites will bring cancer clinical trials and research to low-income, minority, and medically underserved individuals who otherwise would not have access to such studies. These studies will address many diverse factors from patient, provider, organizational, and policy perspectives that contribute to known disparities in cancer detection, treatment, and outcomes. Targeting the minority/underserved populations in their communities is a critical step toward alleviating the cancer care disparities prevalent in these populations. The proposed research is relevant to public health as it will bring cancer clinical trials and cancer care  delivery research to minority and underserved individuals in their own communities.

"Data Coordinating and Operations Center (DCOC) for the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Each year in Lafayette County, Arkansas, 16 of every 1,000 infants die before their first birthday;1 this infant mortality rate is greater than that of many second-world countries. Thirty-six percent of Arkansas residents live in rural areas, almost one in three children lives in poverty, and all counties are medically underserved.2 Arkansas is an IDeA state and is joined in these disparities by similarly rural states. Infants and children living in rural and medically underserved IDeA states are less likely than those living in urban states to be enrolled in and benefit from clinical research, especially clinical trials.3-5 To address this disparity in pediatric research, the Environmental Influences on Children Health Outcomes (ECHO) initiatives will establish the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN) to increase representation of and access to clinical trials by children in underserved states with disproportionately low NIH funding. Up to 15 clinical sites located in IDeA states will be funded and supported by one Data Coordinating and Operations Center (DCOC). As such, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) proposes to create the DCOC. Being an academic medical center with a robust clinical research portfolio and experience with conducting research in rural and underserved areas, the proposed team at UAMS is well positioned to serve as the DCOC. The key personnel work across the four ECHO priority areas and are prepared to help ISPCTN sites do the same. The DCOC will work collaboratively with ISPCTN clinical centers to build capability for and increase access to pediatric clinical research in IDeA states to increase generalizability of trial results. To establish the DCOC, UAMS will:  Specific Aim 1: Establish a coordinating center infrastructure to support trials conducted by the  IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network. The proposed DCOC will create a cost-effective  operations and data-coordinating infrastructure to support ISPCTN clinical trials.  Specific Aim 2: Execute the operational tasks and scientific responsibilities of the DCOC as  required within the collaborative agreement. The DCOC will support the operations, logistics, data  management, and biostatistics needs of the ISPCTN.  Specific Aim 3: Develop and implement relevant professional development programs to establish  highly competent pediatric clinical trial teams in IDeA states. The DCOC will leverage existing  infrastructure to provide professional development and mentoring.  The objective of the DCOC is to support the development and implementation of clinical research within the ISPCTN. The UAMS team will work collaboratively with clinical investigators at the ISPCTN sites, Project Scientists, Program Officials, and other NIGMS and NICHD staff to select or design, implement and oversee clinical trials addressing the ECHO priority areas and the health needs of children living in IDeA states. PROJECT NARRATIVE DCOC administrators will work collaboratively with clinical investigators and staff to optimize and implement clinical trials that address the challenging health needs of children living in IDeA states. By expanding the reach of clinical trial recruitment to traditionally under-funded states, researchers and clinicians will receive a better understanding of public health in these areas and in populations that may have been underrepresented in such trials traditionally.",Data Coordinating and Operations Center (DCOC) for the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network,9263498,U24HD090912,"['Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Arkansas ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Collection ', ' Environment ', ' Medical Ethics ', ' Faculty ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Housing ', ' Infant ', ' Postneonatal Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Investments ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Poverty ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Technology ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Administrator ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Ensure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Logistics ', ' Funding ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' Prevention ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NIGMS ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Center of Biomedical Research Excellence ', ' COBRE ', ' Centers of Research Excellence ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Pediatric Research ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' health literacy ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' underserved rural area ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' medically underserved ', "" National Children's Study "", ' clinical care ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' sharing data ', ' operation ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,U24,2016,157082,0.08125802715235592

"Alliance NCORP Research Base DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Alliance NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base conducts interventional and observational clinical trials as well as database analyses addressing important questions concerning cancer prevention, screening, symptom intervention, post-treatment surveillance/survivorship, quality of life and cancer care delivery. We place special emphasis upon issues affecting minority, underserved and elderly patient groups, and upon building strong collegial relationships with NCORP Community sites and Minority/Underserved Community sites. The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance), one of the five National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) groups, serves as the coordinating center for the conduct of all NCORP Research Base trials. The Alliance members represent community practices and academic medical centers in approximately equal number, so the results of the trials broadly reflect the actual experience of patients across the United States. In order to improve our understanding of the biological basis of cancer risk and pre-malignant disease, biomarkers that detect pre-symptomatic newly diagnosed or recurrent malignancies, as well as the physiologic mechanisms of cancer-related symptoms and treatment-related toxicities, most of our clinical trials include translational research questions requiring the collection of tumor tissue, premalignant tissue samples, blood, or other human biospecimens. These biospecimens create an invaluable repository for understanding the associations between laboratory and clinical observations. The Alliance NCORP Research Base collaborates broadly with other NCORP Research Bases to enroll patients in trials, conduct translational studies, and share data and biospecimens for pooled analyses. We also collaborate broadly with other NCI-funded investigators and consortia, as well as investigators supported through non-NCI sources. Results of Alliance investigator efforts have resulted in more than 99 abstracts and manuscripts over the past five years, many resulting in significant beneficial changes in clinical practice. The scientific questions answered by the Alliance NCORP Research Base represent meaningful and innovative contributions to biomedical sciences, and can only be addressed through a publicly-funded research network. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately one in three women and one in two men in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime.

"Cancer Center Support Grant P30 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC), a consortium with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), is a matrix organization under the aegis of the UC Davis Health System and University of California, Davis. Two hundred and four members are organized into six programs, supported by eight shared resources, and led by Senior Leadership in order to use transdisciplinary, translational, and transformative research to address the following problems: With a rapidly aging population, 40 million Americans over the age of 65 are alive today and 390,000 will die from cancer this year. In 15 years, approximately, 74 million Americans of this age will be alive and cancer mortality will be ~730,000/year. The present methods by which new cancer therapies have been developed have met with a disappointing failure rate; therefore, improved translational methods are needed. So too are integrated programs that combine physical sciences, biomedical technology, and functional imaging to develop new therapies and delivery modalities as well as methods for functional evaluation and enhanced detection to determine, in a non-toxic fashion, if therapies will work. Two main foci are used to address these problems:  1) Reducing disparities in the cancer burden  2) Tackling advanced cancer by adapting molecularly targeted therapy through our patient derived  xenograft program (PDX) and canine patients to truly develop personalized medicine. Each of these uses a multi-disciplinary approach, combining expertise from across programs (Molecular Oncology, Comparative Oncology, Cancer Therapeutics, Population Sciences and Health Disparities, Prostate Urothelial Cancer, and Biomedical Technology), leveraging the UC Davis expertise (e.g., School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Biological Sciences, Department of Biomedical Technology), and with external partners (the Jackson Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Foundation Medicine). Seven Innovation Groups enhance collaborative interactions and proposals with focus on translating basic and technological findings into grants and investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Beyond that, the UCDCCC’s robust clinical trials program enables these discoveries to be translated into patient benefits. The portfolio consist of NCI awards to fund Phase I, II, and III trials, COG and NCI Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium trials, and a strong portfolio of IITs. These are implemented by a cadre of clinical scientists (11 of whom were recruited in the past funding period) who function as the interface of translational and clinical research. The catchment area (13 counties surrounding Sacramento county) is benefited through, among other activities, a city-wide early phase clinical trials program and the UCDCCC Cancer Care Network, through which the resources and expertise of a comprehensive cancer center are brought to disadvantaged and rural areas while keeping patients in their home communities. Finally, in this world of ever-changing cancer care delivery models, combined with an increasing numbers of patients seeking help and increasing complexities of treatments available, we are building a robust cancer supportive/psycho oncology program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer and its effects are an ever-increasing problem at the population and individual levels. The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center's research is aimed at reducing this burden through cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment that is truly precision and personalized. Unique research strategies include the use of patient-derived xenografts, canine clinical trials, and state-of-the-art imaging, all of which is focused on translating discoveries into innovative clinical trials that ultimately improve the lives of patients and families with cancer.",Cancer Center Support Grant P30,9340403,P30CA093373,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Award ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' California ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' domestic dog ', ' canine ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' Dogs ', ' Canine Species ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Patients ', ' physical science ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Veterinary Medicine ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Work ', ' ranpirnase ', ' P30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' County ', ' Generations ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' Transcend ', ' meetings ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' molecular oncology ', ' care delivery ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' member ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' Modality ', ' Biomedical Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Genomic Stability ', ' Genome Stability ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Detection ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' CCSG ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Molecular ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Oncogenic ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' comparative ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' population health ', ' oncology program ', ' precision medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' improved outcome ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P30,2016,250000,0.015294446579397119
"Sanford Community Cancer Program of the North Central Plains DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rural communities of the upper Midwest and Central Plains represent a large underserved population for cancer treatment, care delivery and clinical trials. The causes of this difference are multi-factorial but a main obstacle is access to services in rural regional areas. Sanford Health has developed a network of hospitals, cancer centers and clinics to provide high quality multi-disciplinary cancer treatment, clinical trials, ad cancer care delivery to this underserved area. It is hypothesized that this disparity in care for this rural population can be improved by utilizing the organized Sanford Community Cancer Program (SCCP) network community.  This proposal describes the NCI NCORP partnership to help deliver clinical trials and cancer care delivery across the rural area the SCCP serves. This will be accomplished through the following aims:  1. /Maintain and enhance robust accrual to NCI Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) supported clinical trials through our five primary components.  2. Address disparities in clinical trial accrual in underserved and underrepresented populations to increase participation.  3. Cultivate Innovative access points to address barriers to clinical trial accrual through outreach and telemedicine.  4. Develop a Cancer Care Delivery infrastructure.  Through these four aims the Sanford Community Cancer Program will transform implementation of state of the art clinical trials, cancer treatment and cancer care delivery to approximately two million people across parts of five states living in rura America. Many of these people are more than 2 hours from the nearest community cancer center, a situation complicated by 4 to 6 months of harsh weather, which can make travel unpredictable and often dangerous. The ability to provide cancer care, including clinical trials, through outreach and telemedicine to this underserved rural population in their local communities ensures timely, optimal treatment and improved outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: the Sanford Community Cancer Program will continue to offer NCI clinical trials and provide state-of-the-art cancer treatment and cancer care delivery to approximately two million people across six states ability to provide clinical trials through outreach and telemedicine to this underserved rural population of patients increases their opportunity for participation in a trial as a treatment option.

"Wisconsin NCI Community Oncology Research Program (WiNCORP) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of the Wisconsin NCI Community Oncology Research Program (WiNCORP) is to provide access to NCI-sponsored clinical trials to over 680,000 community members residing within its collective, largely rural, service area spanning most of the state of Wisconsin, upper Michigan and adjacent counties in northern Iowa and Southeastern Minnesota. WiNCORP represents a consortium between three legacy Wisconsin CCOPs in good standing (Gundersen Health Systems, St. Vincent Regional Cancer Center and Marshfield Clinic) who have historically met and exceeded accrual goals, accruing nearly 9,000 subjects in the program's history. WiNCORP's prior track record in accruals to NCI-sponsored clinical trials  and strong historical track record in cancer care delivery research (CCDR) position WiNCORP to apply as a  high performance NCORP site. This alignment of clinical and research infrastructure ideally positions  WiNCORP to promote NCI's vision for NCORP by facilitating NCI trial access for a large, underrepresented  patient population residing in predominantly rural-designated settings and engaging CCDR. Strategically,  WiNCORP seeks expansion in a variety and number of NCI sponsored clinical trials including CCDR to  increase both access and accrual to a rural population largely underrepresented in clinical trials thus  addressing a disparity gap. Specific aims to accomplish these goals include: 1) Conduct NCI phase l/ll, II and III cancer screening, prevention, symptom management, treatment, post-treatment, imaging and quality of life trials across the entire WiNCORP service area. Tasks include expanded educational strategies targeting patients, providers, and the community, with emphasis on minority populations and streamlining recruitment strategies across WiNCORP to promote accrual. 2) Facilitate conduct of Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) across of integrated health care systems through establishment of an expanded research infrastructure. Tasks include establishment of care coordination and navigation teams to facilitate CCDR. 3)  Facilitate accrual to molecular target driven trials. Tasks include engagement of institutional resources and newly established WiNCORP infrastructure to create opportunities for supporting this trial type. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The establishment of WiNCORP will provide opportunities for community members who live in Wisconsin, the upper Michigan peninsula, northeastern Iowa and southeastern Minnesota to access NCI-sponsored clinical trials. Establishment of WiNCORP is especially important to remove barriers to participation in cancer trials for members of these largely rural communities.",Wisconsin NCI Community Oncology Research Program (WiNCORP),9117480,UG1CA189956,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Biopsy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community HealthTutoring ', ' Community Health Taining ', ' Community Education ', ' Community Health Education ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Iowa ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Leadership ', ' Michigan ', ' Minnesota ', ' Nursing Care ', ' Care given by nurses ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' Social Workers ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' surgery specialty ', ' Surgical Profession ', ' Surgical Specialties ', ' survivorship ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Wisconsin ', ' World Health ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' County ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Rural Community ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' Regional Cancer ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' virtual world ', ' virtual environment ', ' VR simulation ', ' virtual reality ', ' case control ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Institution ', ' palliative ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Research Network ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Navigation System ', ' encryption ', ' tool development ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical infrastructure ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' ']",NCI,MARSHFIELD CLINIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION,UG1,2016,1779996,0.09584648248289655
"Gulf South Minority-based NCI Community Oncology Research Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Gulf South-Minority Based-NCI Community Oncology Research Program (GS-MB-NCORP) brings together an integrated clinical trials program from two Minority Based CCOPs (MBCCOP) and an NCCCP site in the state of Louisiana, supported by well-established and funded Cancer Care Delivery Research and programs in Health Disparities and Community-Based Participatory Research. The MBCCOP established by the LSU School of Medicine in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO-MBCCOP) and its NCCCP partner, the Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center - Our Lady of the Lake Hospital (MBP-OLOL) in Baton Rouge, have joined the MBCCOP at the LSU School of Medicine in Shreveport (LSUHSC-SH-MBCCOP) in northwest Louisiana to create the GS-MB-NCORP. This consortium integrates well-established and experienced teams of clinicians and researchers with the aim of expanding access to state-of-the-art cancer clinical trials to the patients we serve, through a network of leading academic and community hospitals. Louisiana has one of the poorest survival rates for cancer patients in the United States, despite not having the highest incidence for all types of the disease. This is particularly true for underserved and minority patients, clealy reflecting a major health disparity. Possible explanations for this disparity range from socio-economic and access to health care, to poorly understood genetic and biological differences. The LSU MBCCOPs and the NCCCP at MBP-OLOL have independently worked to increase access to clinical trials for minority and underserved communities, establish outreach and education programs, and expand Cancer Care Delivery Research and Health Disparity studies. In the fall of 2012, we agreed to combine our strengths and experience into the GS-MB-NCORP with the goal of having a more significant impact on cancer associated health disparities by integrating our clinical trials programs and incorporating Cancer Care Delivery and Health Disparity researchers into the clinical trials process. The GS-MB-NCORP's goals are to increase the participation of minorities and underserved populations in clinical trials, identify barriers t participation, and incorporate the community in the research studies. To achieve this, we propose the following Specific Aims. 1) Advance an integrated system of access to cancer clinical trials that promote and facilitate the participation and enrollment of patients, in particlar underserved and minority populations in Louisiana. 2) Promote Cancer Care Delivery Research Programs to ensure our ability to participate in research initiatives proposed by the Research Bases, and eventually design protocols that improve the care of our patients. 3) Expand Health Disparities Research programs through community engagement to increase the participation of minority and underserved populations in clinical trials The GS-MB-NCORP will contribute significantly to the agenda o fthe National Cancer Institute and the  Research Bases, by increasing access to prevention, early detection and cutting edge clinical trials to  minority and underserved patients in Louisiana. It will further enhance the biomedical and clinical workforce  in our state by increasing the number of professionals experienced in conducting health disparities research,  developing cancer care delivery capabilities and implementing advanced clinical trials.",Gulf South Minority-based NCI Community Oncology Research Program,9121490,UG1CA189854,"['Avian ', ' Aves ', ' Birds ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Louisiana ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Funding ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' Sampling ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' clinical practice ', ' Minority Participation ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' underserved minority ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' ']",NCI,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,UG1,2016,1944605,0.15502515471558062
"NCI Community Oncology Research Program Minority Underserved Community Sites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  As the Official Cancer Center of the State of New Mexico and as one of the nation's NCI-Designated Cancer Centers (2P30CA118100-09), the UNMCC has built collaborative partnerships with community oncologists and healthcare systems throughout the State of New Mexico to create the New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance (NMCCA), a joint 501c3 statewide cancer clinical trials organization and clinical research network. Through both these collaborative partnerships, UNMCC has worked to improve the quality of cancer care in our region; to enhance community-based cancer education, screening, and prevention; to promote community based participatory research; and to increase awareness, access and participation of all New Mexicans in NCl sponsored cancer screening, prevention and therapeutic clinical trials.

"Columbia University Minority/Underserved Site NCI Community Oncology Research Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site will be based at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC), the home of cancer research at Columbia University Medical Center in the City of New York. The HICCC, located in Washington Heights where >50% of the local residents are foreign-born, including a large Dominican population, has had a commitment and interest in research and service to this community and to the underserved in general that spans decades, predating its recognition as a national priority. Our specific objectives are: 1) to provide a menu of NCl-sponsored Cooperative Group trials to our investigators, including those in the local medical community, for screening, prevention, cancer control, and treatments; 2) to establish close relationships with the NCI Clinical Cooperative Groups to enhance the benefits of clinical research, especially in cancer care delivery research; 3) to attract and educate potential study participants, especially minorities, about participation in cancer clinical research; 4) expand the HICCC Cancer Prevention, Control and Disparities program's current focus on quality of care of cancer, especially as related to disparities of race/ethnicity, age, income, insurance and other factors. Through utilization of the existing HICCC shared resources, Recruitment and Retention of Minorities Office and Clinical Protocol and Data Management Office, 3267 subjects including 2681 minority participants, have been recruited to NCI or externally peer reviewed studies in the past 5 years. With a NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site award, outreach to a broader range of participants will be expanded by 1) supporting recruitment to a wider range of oncology subspecialty trials, especially given the planned expansion of clinical oncology services  and 2) allow activation of more cancer control/prevention studies. This will facilitate a comprehensive approach across the disease and age spectrum, and across treatments, and will facilitate the prioritization of cancer care delivery research studies, in conjunction with the scientific expertise available at HICCC. As such, the range of organ/site specialties for which we provide services to investigators will be broadened thus allowing enrollment of still more minority patients in a wider range of cancer research trials.

"NRG Oncology NCORP Research Base DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to establish and maintain the NCORP (National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program) for the NRG Oncology research base. The NRG NCORP is the result of aligning the legacy CCOPs (Community Clinical Oncology Programs) from three NCI Cancer Cooperative Groups: NSABP, RTOG and GOG. These groups together have over almost 100 years of combined experience serving as CCOP Research Bases. NRG NCORP, comprised of a multi-disciplinary team of investigators and patient advocates, is poised to carry out the objectives of: 1) designing and conducting cancer prevention, control and screening clinical trials; 2) designing and embedding patient reported outcomes in therapeutic trials 3) designing and conducting cancer care delivery research; 4) enhancing community access to treatment and imaging trials conducted under the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and 5) integrating disparity research questions into clinical trials and cancer care delivery research. To allow NRG NCORP to meet these goals, the group will: participate fully in NRG Oncology leadership and will determine the scientific direction and prioritization of the NRG NCORP activities and resources and oversee the translational research, clinical trial activities, and correlative studies related to the aims of NG NCORP. With the NRG Statistical and Data Management Center, this team will provide efficient, methodologically up-to-date trial design, monitoring, reporting, and analysis; build an infrastructure to support our cancer care delivery research agenda; provide comprehensive data management quality control and quality assurance programs to ensure high data integrity and timely data for analysis; leverage cutting edge information technology emphasizing security, timeliness, and efficiency of data collection and management; providing RT credentialing and quality assurance; and provide education and training for institutional Clinical Research Associates, Study Chairs, local Principal Investigators and others involved in the NRG NCORP research agenda. Further, to accomplish these aims NRG NCORP will engage fully with NCI-designated NCORP community physicians and patient advocates as well as the NCI and other NCl-sponsored entities (cooperative groups, cancer centers, SPOREs) to collaborate across the NCTN to improve cancer care and quality of life for patients affected by cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: NRG Oncology is an NCI funded research group formed through the alignment of the legacy research bases of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Program (NSABP), the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG). NRG NCORP research will significantly impact cancer prevention, screening, control and care delivery, and bring state-of-the-art treatment trials to community centers.

"Cancer Center Support Grant P30 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC), a consortium with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), is a matrix organization under the aegis of the UC Davis Health System and University of California, Davis. Two hundred and four members are organized into six programs, supported by eight shared resources, and led by Senior Leadership in order to use transdisciplinary, translational, and transformative research to address the following problems: With a rapidly aging population, 40 million Americans over the age of 65 are alive today and 390,000 will die from cancer this year. In 15 years, approximately, 74 million Americans of this age will be alive and cancer mortality will be ~730,000/year. The present methods by which new cancer therapies have been developed have met with a disappointing failure rate; therefore, improved translational methods are needed. So too are integrated programs that combine physical sciences, biomedical technology, and functional imaging to develop new therapies and delivery modalities as well as methods for functional evaluation and enhanced detection to determine, in a non-toxic fashion, if therapies will work. Two main foci are used to address these problems:  1) Reducing disparities in the cancer burden  2) Tackling advanced cancer by adapting molecularly targeted therapy through our patient derived  xenograft program (PDX) and canine patients to truly develop personalized medicine. Each of these uses a multi-disciplinary approach, combining expertise from across programs (Molecular Oncology, Comparative Oncology, Cancer Therapeutics, Population Sciences and Health Disparities, Prostate Urothelial Cancer, and Biomedical Technology), leveraging the UC Davis expertise (e.g., School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Biological Sciences, Department of Biomedical Technology), and with external partners (the Jackson Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Foundation Medicine). Seven Innovation Groups enhance collaborative interactions and proposals with focus on translating basic and technological findings into grants and investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Beyond that, the UCDCCC’s robust clinical trials program enables these discoveries to be translated into patient benefits. The portfolio consist of NCI awards to fund Phase I, II, and III trials, COG and NCI Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium trials, and a strong portfolio of IITs.

"IMproving Pediatric Access to Clinical Trials in Vermont (IMPACT VT) Rural children, like those in Vermont and northern New York, are underrepresented in pediatric clinical trials. The University of Vermont (UVM) serves a large catchment area in this region, where children receive primary medical care in community-based primary care practices and specialty care at UVM Children's Hospital. We have a strong referral base and established collaborations with primary care practices throughout the region and across subspecialty practices. This will enable access to pediatric clinical trials through the ISPCTN for all children in our area, including underserved and minority populations. The objective of this proposal is to expand the infrastructure and expertise in the conduct of pediatric clinical trials at UVM, in order to address disparities and improve access to clinical trials in rural, underserved areas. UVM is committed to becoming an integral component of the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN), and will advance the goals of the network through the following specific aims: 1. UVM will establish a comprehensive pediatric clinical trials site within the ISPCTN. In collaboration with the ISPCTN, UVM will build a strong foundation by training a core team and establish the infrastructure to initiate and maintain a pediatric clinical trials center. This award will support a team that will subsequently build and enhance collaborative opportunities in multi- center ISPCTN pediatric clinical trials. 2. Through training, mentoring, and participation in ISPCTN trials, we will expand local expertise in the conduct of pediatric clinical trials in the UVM Network. Health Care Professionals/faculty, coordinators, and data management personnel will be strategically trained to conduct pediatric clinical trials. An ongoing program of courses, staff training, and mentoring by the core team (developed in aim 1) will be established to carefully expand a well-trained team who will serve pediatric clinical trials throughout our network. Our clinical investigators, nurses, support staff, and data managers will develop next-generation expertise through experience and specific mentoring and training. 3. UVM will enhance access for rural, underserved, and minority children in VT and northern NY to pediatric clinical trials through ISPCTN participation, with the goal of improving the health of all children. By building a comprehensive outreach program and a confidential registry of available participants for ISPCTN clinical trials, we will assure access to state-of-the art clinical trials for rural, underserved, and minority children of VT and northern NY that will have a meaningful impact on the health of all children. Metrics for enrollment of underserved populations will be established. Our outreach program will leverage our existing relationships and collaborations with rural networks of health providers and patients to offer participation in pediatric clinical trials. Our IMproving Pediatric Access to Clinical Trials VT (IMPACT VT) program will consolidate our existing expertise into an enduring, accessible pediatric clinical trial infrastructure with the ISPCTN. Prioritization of the ECHO Program focus areas aligns with the needs of our population, expertise, and interests. NARRATIVE Despite being a large segment of the population, rural, minority, and underserved children are traditionally underrepresented in clinical trials, often due to decreased access. Failure to represent these children in pediatric studies overlooks the needs of an important segment of the population, limits the scientific evidence base and leads to unequal distribution of the opportunity to benefit from medicine and research. Our program, IMproving Pediatric Access to Clinical Trials in Vermont (IMpact VT) will increase access to pediatric clinical trials for these children and in the long-term will decrease these disparities with the goal of improving health for all children.",IMproving Pediatric Access to Clinical Trials in Vermont (IMPACT VT),9263299,UG1HD090907,"['Award ', ' Benevolence ', ' Beneficence ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Faculty ', ' family medicine ', ' Family Practice ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Justice ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' New York ', ' Nurses ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Rural Population ', ' Safety ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Universities ', ' Vermont ', ' Work ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatrician ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' programs ', ' interest ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Medical center ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' outreach program ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Catchment Area ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' underserved rural area ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' evidence base ', ' Belmont Report ', ' underserved minority ', ' minority children ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,UG1,2016,50493,0.09621252481110233
"Hawai'i Minority/Underserved NCORP DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aims of the Hawaii Minority/Underserved NCORP are to build on the accomplishments already made by the Hawai'i MB-CCOP since 1994 and the Hawai'i NCCCP since 2010. As the primary provider of NCI clinical trials and health care delivery research in our state which has a majority of racial/ethnic minority patients, the Hawai'i Minority/Underserved NCORP will continue to provide individuals in their own communities with NCORP studies, thereby contributing to an evidence base that will lead to improved patient outcomes and reduce cancer disparities experienced by the people of Hawai'i and elsewhere. The Hawai'i Minority/Underserved NCORP will continue to use a network of components and subcomponents established through the MB-CCOP and contribute to the administrative and scientific leadership of research bases, as before. The Queen's Medical Center component is a recipient of an NCCCP award which has enabled it to build substantial capacity to conduct cancer care delivery research and a group of investigators who will contribute to scientific and administrative leadership in research bases generating these studies. Participating in NCORP cancer prevention, control, screening/post treatment surveillance, treatment and imaging trials along with health related quality of life and cancer care delivery research, will enable past accomplishments in reducing cancer care disparities to be taken to an even higher level to reduce the burden of cancer for the people of Hawai'i and elsewhere. The Hawai'i Minority/Underserved NCORP through 1) conducting clinical trial/cancer care delivery research,  2) contributing to NCORP research bases, and 3) contributing Hawaii's multiracial/multiehnic population to a  national evidence base, will reduce cancer care disparities and the burden of cancer for the people of  Hawai'i and elsewhere.",Hawai'i Minority/Underserved NCORP,9114543,UG1CA189804,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Award ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Hawaii ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Universities ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Individual ', ' Oncologist ', ' cancer prevention ', ' programs ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' health related quality of life ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' evidence base ', ' screening ', ' underserved minority ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,UG1,2016,812590,0.09256732502195658
"Development of a Pediatric Clinical Trials Consortium to Increase Research Exposure for Children and Adolescents in Louisiana PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Establishing improved access to pediatric clinical trials is critical given the poor state of health and intractable health disparities that face children in Louisiana, particularly in relation to the four focus areas of the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO): obesity, neurodevelopment, asthma, and birth outcomes. Given our current understanding of the developmental origins of health and disease, increasing pediatric clinical trials targeting early disease and risk factors for later health outcomes, particularly in populations including ethnic minorities where risk factors are elevated, is critical. This proposal plans to establish a pediatric clinical trials site in Louisiana in response to RFA-OD-16-001, Clinical Sites for the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (UG1) to address this critical need for pediatric clinical trials in this State. The purpose of this proposal is to establish an innovative consortium based at Pennington Biomedical Research Center (PBRC) in Baton Rouge, LA in collaboration with Tulane University in New Orleans, LA. The overall goal is to leverage the existing clinical research expertise of PBRC in obesity and maternal-fetal health with the clinical expertise and experience of Tulane University School of Medicine in asthma, neurodevelopment, and birth outcomes to establish a uniquely skilled collaborative group able to engage, implement, and translate a range of pediatric clinical trials. Moreover, working with the established infrastructure and modeling the processes of inter-institutional collaboration created by the Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science Center (LA CaTS) (PI: William Cefalu; NIH 1 U54 GM104940) will allow for further dissemination and conduct of clinical trials across the State. The investigators will be supported by a research coordinator at each site and a data manager at PBRC. Regularly scheduled meetings between the investigative teams as well as with the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN) will be held to discuss developments, progress, and future directions. Year 1 will be focused on administrative planning including identifying targeted recruitment sites, establishing appropriate letters of agreement, and streamlining IRB workflow. Years 2 through 4 will be focused on conducting multiple clinical trials as deemed appropriate by the ISPCTN. By expanding the research infrastructure in Louisiana, creating uniform protocols, and integrating with other sites across the United States, we expect the PBRC/Tulane consortium to rapidly participate in clinical trials, initiated locally as well as within the network, bringing new discoveries to children in Louisiana while simultaneously addressing persistent health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Increasing clinical trials in children especially targeting early disease and risk factors related to later health outcomes as adults is critical for public health, particularly in populations including ethnic minorities where risk factors are elevated. Louisiana consistently ranks near the bottom in terms of overall health metrics and has some of the highest rates of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in the country. This proposal will create a consortium based at Pennington Biomedical Research Center (PBRC) in Baton Rouge, LA in collaboration with Tulane University in New Orleans, LA superimposing on the current infrastructure locally as well as tapping into the Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science Center to directly address the need to increase access to state-of-the-art clinical research for underrepresented populations, to enhance pediatric clinical trial capacity, and to implement well-designed clinical trials in pediatric populations in Louisiana.",Development of a Pediatric Clinical Trials Consortium to Increase Research Exposure for Children and Adolescents in Louisiana,9263379,UG1HD090967,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Birth Rate ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Postneonatal Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Louisiana ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Public Health ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Schedule ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Premature Birth ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Pre-term birth ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Country ', ' Live Birth ', ' fetal ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' Adult asthma ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Center for Translational Science Activities ', ' translational sciences center ', ' translational research center ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' inter-institutional ', ' underserved minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' ']",NICHD,LSU PENNINGTON BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH CTR,UG1,2016,64120,0.06088889785786964
"Montana Pediatric Clinical Trials Site Summary Montana and neighboring Institutional Development Award (IDeA) states include a high proportion of vulnerable pediatric populations, but these populations have limited to no opportunities for inclusion in multi- site clinical trials. The IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN) is being created to provide access for underserved and rural populations to state-of-the-art clinical trials and to transfer findings that will benefit the health of all children. The focus of ISPCTN trials will be varied but priority will be given to the four focus areas of the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program which include: 1) upper and lower airway disease; 2) obesity; 3) pre-, peri-, and postnatal outcomes; and 4) neurodevelopment. Through this cooperative agreement the Montana Pediatric Clinical Trials Site (MPCTS) will be a partner member of the ISPCTN. In coordination with the ISPCTN Data Coordinating and Operations Center (DCOC), MPCTS will be a participating recruitment location for ISPCTN Steering Committee-approved multi-site clinical trials. To accomplish this goal the Missoula, Montana based MPCTS team will be led by a board-certified pediatric scientist-investigator and supported by a pediatric-trained Research Nurse Coordinator, a Data Manager and database support. MPCTS will also utilize a part-time nurse at each of two collaborating healthcare centers in Billings, MT and Kalispell, MT. As with the primary Missoula healthcare center, these partner healthcare centers are the specialty and subspecialty pediatric care providers for their respective regions. Collectively these locations serve as the main referral sites for pediatric specialty care in Montana as well as communities in the neighboring IDeA states of Wyoming and Idaho. MCPTS will enhance pediatric recruitment capabilities at these and other sites by leveraging existing IDeA programs in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho to engage health providers and reach out to vulnerable communities. Beginning in year two of this cooperative agreement MCPTS will participate in one or more multi-site pediatric clinical trial(s). Our evaluation plan will be conducted on a continuous basis to assess program effectiveness and to identify opportunities for continuous quality improvement to ensure that the MCPTS meets the needs of our regional pediatric populations by facilitating improved access to cutting-edge pediatric clinical research. Narrative Montana and neighboring Institutional Development Award (IDeA)-eligible states include a high proportion of vulnerable pediatric populations, but these populations have limited to no opportunities for inclusion in multi- site clinical trials.

"Columbus NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need for high quality cancer care in the United States is ever increasing, but the system is in distress.  An aging population will increase demand for services at a at time when rising costs, uneven accessibility,  anticipated workforce shortages and a lack of evidence based cancer care delivery solutions have put the  system into crisis. This was the conclusion of an Institute of Medicine (lOM) committee report which recently published a number of recommendations in ""Delivering High-Quality Cancer Care: Charting a New Course for a System in Crisis"", Washington DC, National Academies Press, 2013"". The important role for clinical trials especially in the area of comparative effectiveness research, an the translation of results into clinical practice was emphasized by the lOM committee. The new National Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) is poised to engage this recommendation and the Columbus CCOP/NCORP with our experience in cancer care delivery research and educational programs to translate research results to care-givers is uniquely suited to this task. We have continued our reputation for innovation by adapting our existing infrastructure in the design of an integrated cancer care delivery research program involving our 3 major hospitals, coordinated by a team headed by a physician with experience in this area. Our history of extensive community interactions will enhance this effort. The Columbus CCOP/NCORP is indeed ready to join with the NCORP as we forge an innovative evidence-based, patient-centered cancer care delivery system. We are proud of our success in the past and look forward to a bright future as the Columbus NCORP. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although great strides have been made, there is a continuing need for the improved and efficient delivery of cancer care based on solid evidence obtained from well-designed clinical research trials.

"Cancer Center Support Grant P30 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC), a consortium with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), is a matrix organization under the aegis of the UC Davis Health System and University of California, Davis. Two hundred and four members are organized into six programs, supported by eight shared resources, and led by Senior Leadership in order to use transdisciplinary, translational, and transformative research to address the following problems: With a rapidly aging population, 40 million Americans over the age of 65 are alive today and 390,000 will die from cancer this year. In 15 years, approximately, 74 million Americans of this age will be alive and cancer mortality will be ~730,000/year. The present methods by which new cancer therapies have been developed have met with a disappointing failure rate; therefore, improved translational methods are needed. So too are integrated programs that combine physical sciences, biomedical technology, and functional imaging to develop new therapies and delivery modalities as well as methods for functional evaluation and enhanced detection to determine, in a non-toxic fashion, if therapies will work. Two main foci are used to address these problems:  1) Reducing disparities in the cancer burden  2) Tackling advanced cancer by adapting molecularly targeted therapy through our patient derived  xenograft program (PDX) and canine patients to truly develop personalized medicine. Each of these uses a multi-disciplinary approach, combining expertise from across programs (Molecular Oncology, Comparative Oncology, Cancer Therapeutics, Population Sciences and Health Disparities, Prostate Urothelial Cancer, and Biomedical Technology), leveraging the UC Davis expertise (e.g., School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Biological Sciences, Department of Biomedical Technology), and with external partners (the Jackson Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Foundation Medicine). Seven Innovation Groups enhance collaborative interactions and proposals with focus on translating basic and technological findings into grants and investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Beyond that, the UCDCCC’s robust clinical trials program enables these discoveries to be translated into patient benefits. The portfolio consist of NCI awards to fund Phase I, II, and III trials, COG and NCI Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium trials, and a strong portfolio of IITs. These are implemented by a cadre of clinical scientists (11 of whom were recruited in the past funding period) who function as the interface of translational and clinical research. The catchment area (13 counties surrounding Sacramento county) is benefited through, among other activities, a city-wide early phase clinical trials program and the UCDCCC Cancer Care Network, through which the resources and expertise of a comprehensive cancer center are brought to disadvantaged and rural areas while keeping patients in their home communities.

"Recruiting underserved populations into clinical trials with customizable media ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Racial and ethnic minorities, older adults and those from rural communities continue to be underrepresented in cancer and other clinical trials research, despite annual spending on patient recruitment in excess of $1 billion. While many individual studies have demonstrated that targeted outreach and education to underrepresented patients and engagement of front line providers in community hospitals can help boost participation in clinical trials, few of these strategies have evolved into scalable systems that cn support recruitment efforts across many organizations simultaneously with demonstrated efficacy. MIYO (Make It Your Own) is an online tool that addresses this challenge. MIYO helps healthcare organizations develop and use professional quality recruitment materials to increase research participation among underrepresented groups. In minutes, organizations can create their own versions of audience- tested small media for the specific patients they serve by choosing from a menu of approaches recommended by the Guide to Community Preventive Services, then customizing them by choosing from a library of images, messages and graphic designs. Creations can be printed, e- mailed, texted, used online or distributed in other ways to target audiences. In a wide range of Phase I equivalent studies, MIYO has been used to promote HPV vaccination, use of tobacco quit lines, colorectal cancer screening, and use of clinical trials recruitment materials. Findings from this research shows that MIYO is well liked and easy to use; helpful in designing outreach and education products that are targeted for vulnerable population sub-groups, and effective in increasing audience responses like a calling 1-800-4-CANCER. The proposed Direct to Phase II study will expand the Clinical Trials Participation module in MIYO and evaluate its effectiveness in getting patients to enter Pioneers, a research recruitment registry. In partnership with the Midwest Cancer Alliance, we will randomize its 22 community hospital and health center members to either an active MIYO condition or delayed use control, and compare rates of enrollment overall and in priority sub-groups 12 months pre- and post-implementation of MIYO. Increased and more diverse participation in clinical trials will improve the lives of cancer patients and their families, and elp eliminate cancer health disparities in the U.S. population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The burden of cancer on U.S. adults is tremendous and disproportionate among certain population sub-groups. Clinical trials are one of the main pathways to reducing that burden, but participation rates are low, especially among those most affected by cancer. Our study will examine the uptake and effects of an online tool to help healthcare organizations develop and use evidence-based, professional quality recruitment materials to increase research participation in underrepresented groups.",Recruiting underserved populations into clinical trials with customizable media,9134659,R44CA192442,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Investments ', ' Judgment ', ' Libraries ', ' Literature ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Printing ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Rural Community ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' uptake ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' System ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Outcome Study ', ' member ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' response ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' treatment site ', ' evidence base ', ' phase 2 study ', ' phase II study ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NCI,"HEALTH COMMUNICATION IMPACT, LLC",R44,2016,393255,0.05292133595114834

"Hawaii IDeA Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Clinical Trials (HIPACT) ABSTRACT The principal objective of the Hawaii IDeA Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Clinical Trials (HIPACT) is to establish a pediatric clinical trials team in Hawaii to participate in community valued, and scientifically valid multi-center clinical trials, as a partner in the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN). The overarching goal is to improve the health and wellbeing of the diverse multiethnic populations of Hawaii. As the western most IDeA-eligible state, Hawaii is home to large populations of diverse rural and underserved populations, including indigenous Hawaiian communities, and immigrant populations of Pacific Islanders and Asians. These communities suffer geographic isolation nationally as well as locally resulting in significant health inequities. Few clinical trials have targeted children from these ethnic groups or Islands. This is unfortunate because these same communities offer a stable population base that is ideal for conducting long- term longitudinal studies. The community-based University of Hawaii at Manoa (UH Manoa) John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM) Department of Pediatrics (DOP) will serve as the home for HIPACT with an innovative fusion of local and national entities included as partners. Locally, our first partner is the Hawaii Pacific Health (HPH) owned regional perinatal medical center - Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children (KMCWC) and the HPH Research Institute (HPHRI). The second partner is the largest community health center in the state – the Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center (WCCHC) that largely serves Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders. Nationally, partnerships have been established with the Mountain West IDeA Clinical and Translational Research-Infrastructure Network (CTR-IN), and the Research Centers in Minority Institutions Translational Research Network (RTRN). The following HIPACT Specific Aims are proposed: 1) To launch and implement pediatric clinical trials as an ISPCTN site by providing an experienced, coordinated, and a committed team of pediatric-trained personnel; 2) To engage Hawaii and other IDeA state communities to provide access to clinical trials including rural and underserved infants, children and adolescents, many of who are Asian, Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders; 3) To contribute to the “science” of ISPCTN multicenter clinical trials research in disparate underserved and/or rural communities by better understanding and overcoming barriers, with the ultimate goal of improving health outcomes; and 4) To increase the number and expertise of JABSOM pediatric clinical trials faculty and their support teams through professional training and education, ultimately to expand ISPCTN research capacity. Hence, HIPACT is well positioned with a unique blend of rural and underserved communities, experienced leadership, committed partners and community leaders to work with ISPCTN and successfully launch and enroll infants, children and adolescents from Hawaii and across IDeA partner institutions in ISPCTN approved trials. NARRATIVE The project will establish the Hawaii IDeA Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Clinical Trials (HIPACT) as a partner in the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN).

"Northwest NCI Community Oncology Research Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer affects 1.6 million Americans in the US each year. Over 37,000 Washington State residents are diagnosed with cancer each year and it has been the overall leading cause of death since 2004. In 2012, cancer was responsible for 12,170 deaths and accounted for approximately 24% of all deaths statewide.  Since 1983, the NCI has extended cancer research into the community and facilitated the translation of research into evidenced based practice through the Community Clinical Oncology Programs (CCOPs). For the past 30 years, cancer patients in the Pacific Northwest have had access to NCI funded oncology clinical  trials via two large community based research networks: Northwest CCOP and Virginia Mason CCOP.  These two highly experienced CCOPs share a 30 year history as separate, but adjacent CCOPs and have joined to form the Northwest NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NW NCORP).  The NW NCORP recognizes the critical contributions that community cancer research programs occupy in clinical research continuum. According to the NCI about 85% of cancer patients are treated in or near their communities. Community hospitals keep patients close to family, friends, and jobs, while treatment at major Cancer Centers may require extended commutes or long stays away from home. Our service orientation and position in the cancer research design-implement-delivery continuum demands collaboration with likeminded community-based entities and modernization of our ability to connect to diverse patient populations  and other stakeholders. With our fundamental principle of clinical research collaboration and cancer care  delivery, the specific aims of the NW NCORP community site are: (1) Accelerate access to clinical trials in  ""real-world"" healthcare delivery settings for cancer patients across the lifespan (pediatrics, adolescent and  young adults, and adults); (2) Build infrastructure for the cancer care delivery research program (CCDR) in  preparation for the capacity to conduct CCDR clinical trials across the NW NCORP Network; and (3)  Develop active strategies for enhancing interaction with NCI-supported programs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a network of community hospitals, clinics, and multidisciplinary providers focused on the entire spectrum of cancer patients (pediatrics to aging adults), the NW NCORP offers a ""real-world"" setting for cancer  patients to access new and emerging medical treatments and supportive care via a national clinical research  network.",Northwest NCI Community Oncology Research Program,9130802,UG1CA189952,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Commuting ', ' Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Leadership ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Modernization ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Pacific Northwest ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Technology ', ' United States ', ' Virginia ', ' Washington ', ' Friends ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' outreach ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Communication Tools ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Preparation ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Mind ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' social media ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' ']",NCI,TACOMA GENERAL HOSPITAL,UG1,2016,841005,0.0892783382825916
"Cancer Center Support Grant P30 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC), a consortium with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), is a matrix organization under the aegis of the UC Davis Health System and University of California, Davis. Two hundred and four members are organized into six programs, supported by eight shared resources, and led by Senior Leadership in order to use transdisciplinary, translational, and transformative research to address the following problems: With a rapidly aging population, 40 million Americans over the age of 65 are alive today and 390,000 will die from cancer this year. In 15 years, approximately, 74 million Americans of this age will be alive and cancer mortality will be ~730,000/year. The present methods by which new cancer therapies have been developed have met with a disappointing failure rate; therefore, improved translational methods are needed. So too are integrated programs that combine physical sciences, biomedical technology, and functional imaging to develop new therapies and delivery modalities as well as methods for functional evaluation and enhanced detection to determine, in a non-toxic fashion, if therapies will work. Two main foci are used to address these problems:  1) Reducing disparities in the cancer burden  2) Tackling advanced cancer by adapting molecularly targeted therapy through our patient derived  xenograft program (PDX) and canine patients to truly develop personalized medicine. Each of these uses a multi-disciplinary approach, combining expertise from across programs (Molecular Oncology, Comparative Oncology, Cancer Therapeutics, Population Sciences and Health Disparities, Prostate Urothelial Cancer, and Biomedical Technology), leveraging the UC Davis expertise (e.g., School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Biological Sciences, Department of Biomedical Technology), and with external partners (the Jackson Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Foundation Medicine). Seven Innovation Groups enhance collaborative interactions and proposals with focus on translating basic and technological findings into grants and investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Beyond that, the UCDCCC’s robust clinical trials program enables these discoveries to be translated into patient benefits. The portfolio consist of NCI awards to fund Phase I, II, and III trials, COG and NCI Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium trials, and a strong portfolio of IITs. These are implemented by a cadre of clinical scientists (11 of whom were recruited in the past funding period) who function as the interface of translational and clinical research. The catchment area (13 counties surrounding Sacramento county) is benefited through, among other activities, a city-wide early phase clinical trials program and the UCDCCC Cancer Care Network, through which the resources and expertise of a comprehensive cancer center are brought to disadvantaged and rural areas while keeping patients in their home communities. Finally, in this world of ever-changing cancer care delivery models, combined with an increasing numbers of patients seeking help and increasing complexities of treatments available, we are building a robust cancer supportive/psycho oncology program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer and its effects are an ever-increasing problem at the population and individual levels. The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center's research is aimed at reducing this burden through cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment that is truly precision and personalized. Unique research strategies include the use of patient-derived xenografts, canine clinical trials, and state-of-the-art imaging, all of which is focused on translating discoveries into innovative clinical trials that ultimately improve the lives of patients and families with cancer.",Cancer Center Support Grant P30,9148394,P30CA093373,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Award ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' California ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' domestic dog ', ' canine ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' Dogs ', ' Canine Species ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Patients ', ' physical science ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Veterinary Medicine ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Work ', ' ranpirnase ', ' P30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' County ', ' Generations ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' Transcend ', ' meetings ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' molecular oncology ', ' care delivery ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' member ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' Modality ', ' Biomedical Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Genomic Stability ', ' Genome Stability ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Detection ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' CCSG ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Molecular ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Oncogenic ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' comparative ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' population health ', ' oncology program ', ' precision medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' improved outcome ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P30,2016,2976626,0.015294446579397119

"Wisconsin NCI Community Oncology Research Program (WiNCORP) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of the Wisconsin NCI Community Oncology Research Program (WiNCORP) is to provide access to NCI-sponsored clinical trials to over 680,000 community members residing within its collective, largely rural, service area spanning most of the state of Wisconsin, upper Michigan and adjacent counties in northern Iowa and Southeastern Minnesota. WiNCORP represents a consortium between three legacy Wisconsin CCOPs in good standing (Gundersen Health Systems, St. Vincent Regional Cancer Center and Marshfield Clinic) who have historically met and exceeded accrual goals, accruing nearly 9,000 subjects in the program's history. WiNCORP's prior track record in accruals to NCI-sponsored clinical trials  and strong historical track record in cancer care delivery research (CCDR) position WiNCORP to apply as a  high performance NCORP site. This alignment of clinical and research infrastructure ideally positions  WiNCORP to promote NCI's vision for NCORP by facilitating NCI trial access for a large, underrepresented  patient population residing in predominantly rural-designated settings and engaging CCDR. Strategically,  WiNCORP seeks expansion in a variety and number of NCI sponsored clinical trials including CCDR to  increase both access and accrual to a rural population largely underrepresented in clinical trials thus  addressing a disparity gap. Specific aims to accomplish these goals include: 1) Conduct NCI phase l/ll, II and III cancer screening, prevention, symptom management, treatment, post-treatment, imaging and quality of life trials across the entire WiNCORP service area. Tasks include expanded educational strategies targeting patients, providers, and the community, with emphasis on minority populations and streamlining recruitment strategies across WiNCORP to promote accrual. 2) Facilitate conduct of Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) across of integrated health care systems through establishment of an expanded research infrastructure. Tasks include establishment of care coordination and navigation teams to facilitate CCDR. 3)  Facilitate accrual to molecular target driven trials. Tasks include engagement of institutional resources and newly established WiNCORP infrastructure to create opportunities for supporting this trial type. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The establishment of WiNCORP will provide opportunities for community members who live in Wisconsin, the upper Michigan peninsula, northeastern Iowa and southeastern Minnesota to access NCI-sponsored clinical trials.

"Cancer Center Support Grant P30 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC), a consortium with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), is a matrix organization under the aegis of the UC Davis Health System and University of California, Davis. Two hundred and four members are organized into six programs, supported by eight shared resources, and led by Senior Leadership in order to use transdisciplinary, translational, and transformative research to address the following problems: With a rapidly aging population, 40 million Americans over the age of 65 are alive today and 390,000 will die from cancer this year. In 15 years, approximately, 74 million Americans of this age will be alive and cancer mortality will be ~730,000/year. The present methods by which new cancer therapies have been developed have met with a disappointing failure rate; therefore, improved translational methods are needed. So too are integrated programs that combine physical sciences, biomedical technology, and functional imaging to develop new therapies and delivery modalities as well as methods for functional evaluation and enhanced detection to determine, in a non-toxic fashion, if therapies will work. Two main foci are used to address these problems:  1) Reducing disparities in the cancer burden  2) Tackling advanced cancer by adapting molecularly targeted therapy through our patient derived  xenograft program (PDX) and canine patients to truly develop personalized medicine. Each of these uses a multi-disciplinary approach, combining expertise from across programs (Molecular Oncology, Comparative Oncology, Cancer Therapeutics, Population Sciences and Health Disparities, Prostate Urothelial Cancer, and Biomedical Technology), leveraging the UC Davis expertise (e.g., School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Biological Sciences, Department of Biomedical Technology), and with external partners (the Jackson Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Foundation Medicine). Seven Innovation Groups enhance collaborative interactions and proposals with focus on translating basic and technological findings into grants and investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Beyond that, the UCDCCC’s robust clinical trials program enables these discoveries to be translated into patient benefits. The portfolio consist of NCI awards to fund Phase I, II, and III trials, COG and NCI Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium trials, and a strong portfolio of IITs. These are implemented by a cadre of clinical scientists (11 of whom were recruited in the past funding period) who function as the interface of translational and clinical research. The catchment area (13 counties surrounding Sacramento county) is benefited through, among other activities, a city-wide early phase clinical trials program and the UCDCCC Cancer Care Network, through which the resources and expertise of a comprehensive cancer center are brought to disadvantaged and rural areas while keeping patients in their home communities. Finally, in this world of ever-changing cancer care delivery models, combined with an increasing numbers of patients seeking help and increasing complexities of treatments available, we are building a robust cancer supportive/psycho oncology program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer and its effects are an ever-increasing problem at the population and individual levels. The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center's research is aimed at reducing this burden through cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment that is truly precision and personalized. Unique research strategies include the use of patient-derived xenografts, canine clinical trials, and state-of-the-art imaging, all of which is focused on translating discoveries into innovative clinical trials that ultimately improve the lives of patients and families with cancer.",Cancer Center Support Grant P30,9560293,P30CA093373,"['County ', ' Generations ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' Transcend ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' molecular oncology ', ' care delivery ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' member ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Modality ', ' Biomedical Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Genome Stability ', ' Genomic Stability ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Detection ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' CCSG ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' P30 Grant ', ' P30 Award ', ' Cancer Grant Supplements ', ' Cancer Grant Supplements (P30) ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Molecular ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Oncogenic ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' comparative ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' population health ', ' oncology program ', ' precision medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' improved outcome ', ' molecular targeted therapies ', ' molecular targeted treatment ', ' molecular targeted therapeutics ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Award ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' California ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' domestic dog ', ' canine ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' Dogs ', ' Canine Species ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Patients ', ' physical science ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Veterinary Schools ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Talents ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Veterinary Medicine ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P30,2017,250000,0.015294446579397119

"NCI Community Oncology Research Program Minority Underserved Community Sites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  As the Official Cancer Center of the State of New Mexico and as one of the nation's NCI-Designated Cancer Centers (2P30CA118100-09), the UNMCC has built collaborative partnerships with community oncologists and healthcare systems throughout the State of New Mexico to create the New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance (NMCCA), a joint 501c3 statewide cancer clinical trials organization and clinical research network. Through both these collaborative partnerships, UNMCC has worked to improve the quality of cancer care in our region; to enhance community-based cancer education, screening, and prevention; to promote community based participatory research; and to increase awareness, access and participation of all New Mexicans in NCl sponsored cancer screening, prevention and therapeutic clinical trials. The sites detailed herein which have worked together for 13 years to enroll New Mexico's highly diverse multiethnic and frequently underserved cancer patients on NCI Cooperative Group trials, as well as investigator initiated and industry trials; plan to continue this collaboration as the New Mexico NCI Community Oncology Research Program Minority/Underserved (NM NCORP). The NM NCORP has a catchment area for both the clinical trials program and the cancer care delivery research that includes the entire State. With a higher percentage of Hispanics and American Indians than any other state, New Mexico's 2.0 million citizens are 40.5% non-Hispanic White, 46.3% Hispanic, 9.4% American Indian, 2.1 % Black and the remainder is Asian & other ethnic minorities. New Mexicans experience unusual cancer patterns and tremendous cancer health disparities. New Mexico is ranked 43rd in the United States for per capita income. According to the 2011 Census Bureau 18.4% of New Mexicans live below the poverty level well above the national average of 13%. Over 50% of New Mexicans live in rural areas of the State with often limited access to healthcare and 22.9% of New Mexicans are uninsured (ranging from 4.8% to 31.6% among the different New Mexico counties). Of the patients accrued to cancer clinical trials at the UNMCC in 2012, 51% were racial/ethnic minorities (37.3% Hispanic/Latino, 8.2% American Indian, 2.1% African American, 1.1% Asian persons, 1.1% Native Hawaiians, and 1.1% reporting (two or more races) and 55% were women.

"Gulf South Minority-based NCI Community Oncology Research Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Gulf South-Minority Based-NCI Community Oncology Research Program (GS-MB-NCORP) brings together an integrated clinical trials program from two Minority Based CCOPs (MBCCOP) and an NCCCP site in the state of Louisiana, supported by well-established and funded Cancer Care Delivery Research and programs in Health Disparities and Community-Based Participatory Research. The MBCCOP established by the LSU School of Medicine in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO-MBCCOP) and its NCCCP partner, the Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center - Our Lady of the Lake Hospital (MBP-OLOL) in Baton Rouge, have joined the MBCCOP at the LSU School of Medicine in Shreveport (LSUHSC-SH-MBCCOP) in northwest Louisiana to create the GS-MB-NCORP. This consortium integrates well-established and experienced teams of clinicians and researchers with the aim of expanding access to state-of-the-art cancer clinical trials to the patients we serve, through a network of leading academic and community hospitals. Louisiana has one of the poorest survival rates for cancer patients in the United States, despite not having the highest incidence for all types of the disease. This is particularly true for underserved and minority patients, clealy reflecting a major health disparity. Possible explanations for this disparity range from socio-economic and access to health care, to poorly understood genetic and biological differences. The LSU MBCCOPs and the NCCCP at MBP-OLOL have independently worked to increase access to clinical trials for minority and underserved communities, establish outreach and education programs, and expand Cancer Care Delivery Research and Health Disparity studies. In the fall of 2012, we agreed to combine our strengths and experience into the GS-MB-NCORP with the goal of having a more significant impact on cancer associated health disparities by integrating our clinical trials programs and incorporating Cancer Care Delivery and Health Disparity researchers into the clinical trials process. The GS-MB-NCORP's goals are to increase the participation of minorities and underserved populations in clinical trials, identify barriers t participation, and incorporate the community in the research studies. To achieve this, we propose the following Specific Aims. 1) Advance an integrated system of access to cancer clinical trials that promote and facilitate the participation and enrollment of patients, in particlar underserved and minority populations in Louisiana. 2) Promote Cancer Care Delivery Research Programs to ensure our ability to participate in research initiatives proposed by the Research Bases, and eventually design protocols that improve the care of our patients. 3) Expand Health Disparities Research programs through community engagement to increase the participation of minority and underserved populations in clinical trials The GS-MB-NCORP will contribute significantly to the agenda o fthe National Cancer Institute and the  Research Bases, by increasing access to prevention, early detection and cutting edge clinical trials to  minority and underserved patients in Louisiana. It will further enhance the biomedical and clinical workforce  in our state by increasing the number of professionals experienced in conducting health disparities research,  developing cancer care delivery capabilities and implementing advanced clinical trials.",Gulf South Minority-based NCI Community Oncology Research Program,9328027,UG1CA189854,"['Avian ', ' Aves ', ' Birds ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Louisiana ', ' Patients ', ' Privatization ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Funding ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' Sampling ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' clinical practice ', ' Minority Participation ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' underserved minority ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' ']",NCI,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,UG1,2017,1619683,0.15502515471558062

"Northwest NCI Community Oncology Research Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer affects 1.6 million Americans in the US each year. Over 37,000 Washington State residents are diagnosed with cancer each year and it has been the overall leading cause of death since 2004. In 2012, cancer was responsible for 12,170 deaths and accounted for approximately 24% of all deaths statewide.  Since 1983, the NCI has extended cancer research into the community and facilitated the translation of research into evidenced based practice through the Community Clinical Oncology Programs (CCOPs). For the past 30 years, cancer patients in the Pacific Northwest have had access to NCI funded oncology clinical  trials via two large community based research networks: Northwest CCOP and Virginia Mason CCOP.  These two highly experienced CCOPs share a 30 year history as separate, but adjacent CCOPs and have joined to form the Northwest NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NW NCORP).  The NW NCORP recognizes the critical contributions that community cancer research programs occupy in clinical research continuum. According to the NCI about 85% of cancer patients are treated in or near their communities. Community hospitals keep patients close to family, friends, and jobs, while treatment at major Cancer Centers may require extended commutes or long stays away from home. Our service orientation and position in the cancer research design-implement-delivery continuum demands collaboration with likeminded community-based entities and modernization of our ability to connect to diverse patient populations  and other stakeholders. With our fundamental principle of clinical research collaboration and cancer care  delivery, the specific aims of the NW NCORP community site are: (1) Accelerate access to clinical trials in  ""real-world"" healthcare delivery settings for cancer patients across the lifespan (pediatrics, adolescent and  young adults, and adults); (2) Build infrastructure for the cancer care delivery research program (CCDR) in  preparation for the capacity to conduct CCDR clinical trials across the NW NCORP Network; and (3)  Develop active strategies for enhancing interaction with NCI-supported programs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a network of community hospitals, clinics, and multidisciplinary providers focused on the entire spectrum of cancer patients (pediatrics to aging adults), the NW NCORP offers a ""real-world"" setting for cancer  patients to access new and emerging medical treatments and supportive care via a national clinical research  network.",Northwest NCI Community Oncology Research Program,9325300,UG1CA189952,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Commuting ', ' Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Leadership ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Modernization ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Pacific Northwest ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' United States ', ' Virginia ', ' Washington ', ' Friends ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' outreach ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' cancer care ', ' Enhancement Technology ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Clinical Oncology ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Communication Tools ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Preparation ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Mind ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' social media ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' ']",NCI,TACOMA GENERAL HOSPITAL,UG1,2017,1080826,0.0892783382825916
"Cancer Center Support Grant P30 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC), a consortium with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), is a matrix organization under the aegis of the UC Davis Health System and University of California, Davis. Two hundred and four members are organized into six programs, supported by eight shared resources, and led by Senior Leadership in order to use transdisciplinary, translational, and transformative research to address the following problems: With a rapidly aging population, 40 million Americans over the age of 65 are alive today and 390,000 will die from cancer this year. In 15 years, approximately, 74 million Americans of this age will be alive and cancer mortality will be ~730,000/year. The present methods by which new cancer therapies have been developed have met with a disappointing failure rate; therefore, improved translational methods are needed. So too are integrated programs that combine physical sciences, biomedical technology, and functional imaging to develop new therapies and delivery modalities as well as methods for functional evaluation and enhanced detection to determine, in a non-toxic fashion, if therapies will work. Two main foci are used to address these problems:  1) Reducing disparities in the cancer burden  2) Tackling advanced cancer by adapting molecularly targeted therapy through our patient derived  xenograft program (PDX) and canine patients to truly develop personalized medicine. Each of these uses a multi-disciplinary approach, combining expertise from across programs (Molecular Oncology, Comparative Oncology, Cancer Therapeutics, Population Sciences and Health Disparities, Prostate Urothelial Cancer, and Biomedical Technology), leveraging the UC Davis expertise (e.g., School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Biological Sciences, Department of Biomedical Technology), and with external partners (the Jackson Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Foundation Medicine). Seven Innovation Groups enhance collaborative interactions and proposals with focus on translating basic and technological findings into grants and investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Beyond that, the UCDCCC’s robust clinical trials program enables these discoveries to be translated into patient benefits. The portfolio consist of NCI awards to fund Phase I, II, and III trials, COG and NCI Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium trials, and a strong portfolio of IITs. These are implemented by a cadre of clinical scientists (11 of whom were recruited in the past funding period) who function as the interface of translational and clinical research. The catchment area (13 counties surrounding Sacramento county) is benefited through, among other activities, a city-wide early phase clinical trials program and the UCDCCC Cancer Care Network, through which the resources and expertise of a comprehensive cancer center are brought to disadvantaged and rural areas while keeping patients in their home communities. Finally, in this world of ever-changing cancer care delivery models, combined with an increasing numbers of patients seeking help and increasing complexities of treatments available, we are building a robust cancer supportive/psycho oncology program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer and its effects are an ever-increasing problem at the population and individual levels. The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center's research is aimed at reducing this burden through cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment that is truly precision and personalized. Unique research strategies include the use of patient-derived xenografts, canine clinical trials, and state-of-the-art imaging, all of which is focused on translating discoveries into innovative clinical trials that ultimately improve the lives of patients and families with cancer.",Cancer Center Support Grant P30,9561055,P30CA093373,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Award ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' California ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' domestic dog ', ' canine ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' Dogs ', ' Canine Species ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Patients ', ' physical science ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Veterinary Schools ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Talents ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Veterinary Medicine ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Generations ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' Transcend ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' molecular oncology ', ' care delivery ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' member ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Modality ', ' Biomedical Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Genome Stability ', ' Genomic Stability ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Detection ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' CCSG ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' P30 Grant ', ' P30 Award ', ' Cancer Grant Supplements ', ' Cancer Grant Supplements (P30) ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Molecular ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Oncogenic ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' comparative ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' population health ', ' oncology program ', ' precision medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' improved outcome ', ' molecular targeted therapies ', ' molecular targeted treatment ', ' molecular targeted therapeutics ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P30,2017,175000,0.015294446579397119

"Alliance NCORP Research Base DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Alliance NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base conducts interventional and observational clinical trials as well as database analyses addressing important questions concerning cancer prevention, screening, symptom intervention, post-treatment surveillance/survivorship, quality of life and cancer care delivery. We place special emphasis upon issues affecting minority, underserved and elderly patient groups, and upon building strong collegial relationships with NCORP Community sites and Minority/Underserved Community sites. The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance), one of the five National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) groups, serves as the coordinating center for the conduct of all NCORP Research Base trials. The Alliance members represent community practices and academic medical centers in approximately equal number, so the results of the trials broadly reflect the actual experience of patients across the United States. In order to improve our understanding of the biological basis of cancer risk and pre-malignant disease, biomarkers that detect pre-symptomatic newly diagnosed or recurrent malignancies, as well as the physiologic mechanisms of cancer-related symptoms and treatment-related toxicities, most of our clinical trials include translational research questions requiring the collection of tumor tissue, premalignant tissue samples, blood, or other human biospecimens. These biospecimens create an invaluable repository for understanding the associations between laboratory and clinical observations. The Alliance NCORP Research Base collaborates broadly with other NCORP Research Bases to enroll patients in trials, conduct translational studies, and share data and biospecimens for pooled analyses. We also collaborate broadly with other NCI-funded investigators and consortia, as well as investigators supported through non-NCI sources. Results of Alliance investigator efforts have resulted in more than 99 abstracts and manuscripts over the past five years, many resulting in significant beneficial changes in clinical practice. The scientific questions answered by the Alliance NCORP Research Base represent meaningful and innovative contributions to biomedical sciences, and can only be addressed through a publicly-funded research network. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately one in three women and one in two men in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime. Research to prevent cancer, detect cancer while it is still curable, improve symptoms related to cancer and its treatment, and enhance cancer care delivery strategies will provide major health and economic benefits for Americans and people around the world.",Alliance NCORP Research Base,9322276,UG1CA189823,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' geriatric screening ', ' Elderly Assessment ', ' Geriatric Assessment ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

The overall objectives of this partnership are to extend novel, innovative, and effective minority recruitment approaches to an expanded base of community component sites, increase opportunities for minority and medically underserved individuals to participate in Cancer Clinical Trial Research (CCTR), and to integrate Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) into the overall MB-NCORP. Accordingly, the specific aims of this proposal are to (1) establish a research infrastructure that will further enable community component sites to conduct CCTR with an emphasis on trials relevant to minority and medically underserved populations, (2) conduct NCI-approved CCTR at the MCC primary component site and throughout the community component sites, and (3) integrate Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) into the overall MB-NCORP. The research design of the MB-NCORP offers a full menu of cancer studies including those in cancer prevention and control, screening, treatment, imaging, and CCDR. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of the NCI as MCC and the community component sites will bring cancer clinical trials and research to low-income, minority, and medically underserved individuals who otherwise would not have access to such studies. These studies will address many diverse factors from patient, provider, organizational, and policy perspectives that contribute to known disparities in cancer detection, treatment, and outcomes. Targeting the minority/underserved populations in their communities is a critical step toward alleviating the cancer care disparities prevalent in these populations. The proposed research is relevant to public health as it will bring cancer clinical trials and cancer care  delivery research to minority and underserved individuals in their own communities. The inclusion of these  individuals in the research will both broaden the applicability of the research and help to reduce the health  cancer disparities in the minority and underserved populations of cancer patients.",VCU Massey Cancer Center Minority Based NCI Community Oncology Research Program,9324194,UG1CA189869,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Award ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Evolution ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Hematology ', ' Hospitals ', ' Institutes ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Leadership ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' Universities ', ' Virginia ', ' Washington ', ' Organizational Policy ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' news ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' social ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' cancer site ', ' cancer location ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Clinical Oncology ', ' Gynecologic Oncology ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Cancer Center ', ' Collection ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' health related quality of life ', ' effectiveness research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' safety net ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' medically underserved ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' patient population ', ' infrastructure development ', ' screening ', ' Minority Enrollment ', ' Minority Recruitment ', ' recruiting minorities ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' underserved minority ', ' ']",NCI,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,UG1,2017,1083195,0.08771784793114917
"Cancer Center Support Grant P30 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC), a consortium with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), is a matrix organization under the aegis of the UC Davis Health System and University of California, Davis. Two hundred and four members are organized into six programs, supported by eight shared resources, and led by Senior Leadership in order to use transdisciplinary, translational, and transformative research to address the following problems: With a rapidly aging population, 40 million Americans over the age of 65 are alive today and 390,000 will die from cancer this year. In 15 years, approximately, 74 million Americans of this age will be alive and cancer mortality will be ~730,000/year. The present methods by which new cancer therapies have been developed have met with a disappointing failure rate; therefore, improved translational methods are needed. So too are integrated programs that combine physical sciences, biomedical technology, and functional imaging to develop new therapies and delivery modalities as well as methods for functional evaluation and enhanced detection to determine, in a non-toxic fashion, if therapies will work. Two main foci are used to address these problems:  1) Reducing disparities in the cancer burden  2) Tackling advanced cancer by adapting molecularly targeted therapy through our patient derived  xenograft program (PDX) and canine patients to truly develop personalized medicine. Each of these uses a multi-disciplinary approach, combining expertise from across programs (Molecular Oncology, Comparative Oncology, Cancer Therapeutics, Population Sciences and Health Disparities, Prostate Urothelial Cancer, and Biomedical Technology), leveraging the UC Davis expertise (e.g., School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Biological Sciences, Department of Biomedical Technology), and with external partners (the Jackson Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Foundation Medicine). Seven Innovation Groups enhance collaborative interactions and proposals with focus on translating basic and technological findings into grants and investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Beyond that, the UCDCCC’s robust clinical trials program enables these discoveries to be translated into patient benefits. The portfolio consist of NCI awards to fund Phase I, II, and III trials, COG and NCI Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium trials, and a strong portfolio of IITs. These are implemented by a cadre of clinical scientists (11 of whom were recruited in the past funding period) who function as the interface of translational and clinical research. The catchment area (13 counties surrounding Sacramento county) is benefited through, among other activities, a city-wide early phase clinical trials program and the UCDCCC Cancer Care Network, through which the resources and expertise of a comprehensive cancer center are brought to disadvantaged and rural areas while keeping patients in their home communities. Finally, in this world of ever-changing cancer care delivery models, combined with an increasing numbers of patients seeking help and increasing complexities of treatments available, we are building a robust cancer supportive/psycho oncology program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer and its effects are an ever-increasing problem at the population and individual levels. The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center's research is aimed at reducing this burden through cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment that is truly precision and personalized. Unique research strategies include the use of patient-derived xenografts, canine clinical trials, and state-of-the-art imaging, all of which is focused on translating discoveries into innovative clinical trials that ultimately improve the lives of patients and families with cancer.",Cancer Center Support Grant P30,9378971,P30CA093373,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Award ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' California ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' domestic dog ', ' canine ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' Dogs ', ' Canine Species ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Patients ', ' physical science ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Veterinary Schools ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Talents ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Veterinary Medicine ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Generations ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' Transcend ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' molecular oncology ', ' care delivery ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' member ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Modality ', ' Biomedical Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Genome Stability ', ' Genomic Stability ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Detection ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' CCSG ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' P30 Grant ', ' P30 Award ', ' Cancer Grant Supplements ', ' Cancer Grant Supplements (P30) ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Molecular ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Oncogenic ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' comparative ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' population health ', ' oncology program ', ' precision medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' improved outcome ', ' molecular targeted therapies ', ' molecular targeted treatment ', ' molecular targeted therapeutics ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P30,2017,125000,0.015294446579397119
"Disparities in the Availability of Cancer Clinical Trials: A Multi-level Analysis Disparities in the Availability of Cancer Clinical Trials: A Multi-level Analysis Participation of minority populations in cancer clinical trials is vital to ensure generalizability of the results generated, facilitate discovery of novel therapies and therapeutic responses that are particularly relevant to traditionally underrepresented populations, and ensure equitable access to new and promising treatments. Yet more than twenty years after Congress mandated that the NIH ensure `sufficient and appropriate' participation of minorities in clinical research, the participation rate of many minority populations remains substantially lower than the composition of the overall US population. Disparities in access to cancer clinical trials are a chief barrier to reducing disparities in trial participation. Thus it is critical to understand the role that geographic variation plays in driving disparities in access to cancer clinical trials if we are to design and target effective interventions to improve minority participation in such trials. Prior studies have had limited success in teasing apart the complex mix of site- and health care system-level factors that influence the availability of different types of cancer clinical trials for minority populations for two chief reasons. First, we currently lack a comprehensive database of sufficiently detailed trial-level characteristics or information about the locations where trials are launched because of the difficulty in synthesizing such information from multiple sources using traditional record linkage methods. As such, prior studies evaluating disparities in the availability of cancer clinical trials have been importantly limited in the range of factors examined and the number and type of trials studied. Second, cancer clinical trials are often launched at multiple sites that operate within larger healthcare systems, and individual recruiting sites often participate in multiple trials, which pose methodological challenges to disentangling the associations between various trial-, site-, and health care system-level factors on cancer clinical trial availability. We propose to address these challenges by integrating information from multiple sources using advanced record linkage methods and applying sophisticated modeling techniques to analyze the resulting multilevel data. The proposed study will improve understanding of how the availability of cancer clinical trials varies across geographic settings and the clinical trials portfolio, which could help target interventions and policies to address disparities in access to the areas most in need. This project will also lay the scientific foundation for a planned future study to predict enrollment of patient populations traditionally underrepresented in clinical research in publicly funded cancer clinical trials. Participation of minority populations in cancer clinical trials is vital to ensure generalizability of the results generated, facilitate discovery of novel therapies and therapeutic responses that are particularly relevant to traditionally underrepresented populations, and ensure equitable access to new and promising treatments. Yet the participation rate of many minority populations remains substantially lower than the composition of the overall US population.

"Columbia University Minority/Underserved Site NCI Community Oncology Research Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site will be based at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC), the home of cancer research at Columbia University Medical Center in the City of New York. The HICCC, located in Washington Heights where >50% of the local residents are foreign-born, including a large Dominican population, has had a commitment and interest in research and service to this community and to the underserved in general that spans decades, predating its recognition as a national priority. Our specific objectives are: 1) to provide a menu of NCl-sponsored Cooperative Group trials to our investigators, including those in the local medical community, for screening, prevention, cancer control, and treatments; 2) to establish close relationships with the NCI Clinical Cooperative Groups to enhance the benefits of clinical research, especially in cancer care delivery research; 3) to attract and educate potential study participants, especially minorities, about participation in cancer clinical research; 4) expand the HICCC Cancer Prevention, Control and Disparities program's current focus on quality of care of cancer, especially as related to disparities of race/ethnicity, age, income, insurance and other factors. Through utilization of the existing HICCC shared resources, Recruitment and Retention of Minorities Office and Clinical Protocol and Data Management Office, 3267 subjects including 2681 minority participants, have been recruited to NCI or externally peer reviewed studies in the past 5 years. With a NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site award, outreach to a broader range of participants will be expanded by 1) supporting recruitment to a wider range of oncology subspecialty trials, especially given the planned expansion of clinical oncology services  and 2) allow activation of more cancer control/prevention studies. This will facilitate a comprehensive approach across the disease and age spectrum, and across treatments, and will facilitate the prioritization of cancer care delivery research studies, in conjunction with the scientific expertise available at HICCC. As such, the range of organ/site specialties for which we provide services to investigators will be broadened thus allowing enrollment of still more minority patients in a wider range of cancer research trials.

"Sanford Community Cancer Program of the North Central Plains DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rural communities of the upper Midwest and Central Plains represent a large underserved population for cancer treatment, care delivery and clinical trials. The causes of this difference are multi-factorial but a main obstacle is access to services in rural regional areas. Sanford Health has developed a network of hospitals, cancer centers and clinics to provide high quality multi-disciplinary cancer treatment, clinical trials, ad cancer care delivery to this underserved area. It is hypothesized that this disparity in care for this rural population can be improved by utilizing the organized Sanford Community Cancer Program (SCCP) network community.  This proposal describes the NCI NCORP partnership to help deliver clinical trials and cancer care delivery across the rural area the SCCP serves. This will be accomplished through the following aims:  1. /Maintain and enhance robust accrual to NCI Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) supported clinical trials through our five primary components.  2. Address disparities in clinical trial accrual in underserved and underrepresented populations to increase participation.  3. Cultivate Innovative access points to address barriers to clinical trial accrual through outreach and telemedicine.  4. Develop a Cancer Care Delivery infrastructure.  Through these four aims the Sanford Community Cancer Program will transform implementation of state of the art clinical trials, cancer treatment and cancer care delivery to approximately two million people across parts of five states living in rura America. Many of these people are more than 2 hours from the nearest community cancer center, a situation complicated by 4 to 6 months of harsh weather, which can make travel unpredictable and often dangerous. The ability to provide cancer care, including clinical trials, through outreach and telemedicine to this underserved rural population in their local communities ensures timely, optimal treatment and improved outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: the Sanford Community Cancer Program will continue to offer NCI clinical trials and provide state-of-the-art cancer treatment and cancer care delivery to approximately two million people across six states ability to provide clinical trials through outreach and telemedicine to this underserved rural population of patients increases their opportunity for participation in a trial as a treatment option. As a community based health care organization, the SCCP will participate in the development and implementation of cancer care delivery research to better understand and improve patient outcomes.",Sanford Community Cancer Program of the North Central Plains,9323348,UG1CA189825,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Americas ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitals ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentorship ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rural Population ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Weather ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Rural Community ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Rural ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Immigrant ', ' Native Americans ', ' Community Networks ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' health care service organization ', ' health care organization ', ' hutterite ', ' care delivery ', ' outreach ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Clinical Oncology ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Division of Cancer Prevention ', ' Gynecologic Oncology Group ', ' GOG ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' chemotherapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' operation ', ' screening ', ' National Clinical Trials Network ', ' NCI National Clinical Trials Network ', ' improved outcome ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' rural America ', ' rural underserved ', ' ']",NCI,SANFORD RESEARCH/USD,UG1,2017,1174590,0.1266351394557173
"Cancer Center Support Grant P30 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC), a consortium with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), is a matrix organization under the aegis of the UC Davis Health System and University of California, Davis. Two hundred and four members are organized into six programs, supported by eight shared resources, and led by Senior Leadership in order to use transdisciplinary, translational, and transformative research to address the following problems: With a rapidly aging population, 40 million Americans over the age of 65 are alive today and 390,000 will die from cancer this year. In 15 years, approximately, 74 million Americans of this age will be alive and cancer mortality will be ~730,000/year. The present methods by which new cancer therapies have been developed have met with a disappointing failure rate; therefore, improved translational methods are needed. So too are integrated programs that combine physical sciences, biomedical technology, and functional imaging to develop new therapies and delivery modalities as well as methods for functional evaluation and enhanced detection to determine, in a non-toxic fashion, if therapies will work. Two main foci are used to address these problems:  1) Reducing disparities in the cancer burden  2) Tackling advanced cancer by adapting molecularly targeted therapy through our patient derived  xenograft program (PDX) and canine patients to truly develop personalized medicine. Each of these uses a multi-disciplinary approach, combining expertise from across programs (Molecular Oncology, Comparative Oncology, Cancer Therapeutics, Population Sciences and Health Disparities, Prostate Urothelial Cancer, and Biomedical Technology), leveraging the UC Davis expertise (e.g., School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Biological Sciences, Department of Biomedical Technology), and with external partners (the Jackson Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Foundation Medicine). Seven Innovation Groups enhance collaborative interactions and proposals with focus on translating basic and technological findings into grants and investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Beyond that, the UCDCCC’s robust clinical trials program enables these discoveries to be translated into patient benefits. The portfolio consist of NCI awards to fund Phase I, II, and III trials, COG and NCI Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium trials, and a strong portfolio of IITs. These are implemented by a cadre of clinical scientists (11 of whom were recruited in the past funding period) who function as the interface of translational and clinical research. The catchment area (13 counties surrounding Sacramento county) is benefited through, among other activities, a city-wide early phase clinical trials program and the UCDCCC Cancer Care Network, through which the resources and expertise of a comprehensive cancer center are brought to disadvantaged and rural areas while keeping patients in their home communities.

"Lead Academic Participating Site for the Development and Conduct of NCTN Trials DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC) at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) is applying to become a Lead Academic Site in the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). The SCC has been a leading accrual site for the NCTN, averaging 205 patients enrolled annually on CTEP trials over the past six years. Leading this effort are SCC Director Robert Mannel, MD (Contact PI) and Associate Director for Clinical Research Scott McMeekin, MD (PI). Both PIs have an outstanding record of scientific and administrative leadership. Along with the grant Investigators, they clearly demonstrate an ability and commitment to function as a coordinated research team and work effectively with components across the NCTN. The SCC is currently a primary institution for Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG), Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), and Alliance (previously CALGB). In addition, it registers patients on ECOG and SWOG trials through the CTSU mechanism and actively participates with ACRIN. The SCC has been a leader for the past decade in the design and conduct of CTEP trials that have defined the standard of care for numerous malignancies. Over the past six years the SCC enrolled 1,232 patients on CTEP therapeutic trials, including an all-time institutional high of 238 patients in 2012 (with projecte enrollment of 258 in 2013), making it a national leader in accrual for the NCTN. As a Lead Academic Site the SCC will continue to work with Network coordinating centers to be a leader in the design and conduct of NCTN trials for newly-developed therapies, including multi-modality treatments, combinations of novel agents, molecularity-based treatments, advanced imaging approaches, quality biospecimen acquisition and translational research. It will accomplish this goal within the context of providing high-quality cancer care and access to NCTN clinical trials for Oklahomans, especially for the state's special populations that experience significantly high rates of cancer health disparities. As the state's only academic cancer center, the SCC plays a crucial role in providing all Oklahomans access to NCTN clinical trials, definitively evaluating novel therapies, raising the standard of care and easing the burden of cancer for the region.

"Cancer Center Support Grant P30 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC), a consortium with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), is a matrix organization under the aegis of the UC Davis Health System and University of California, Davis. Two hundred and four members are organized into six programs, supported by eight shared resources, and led by Senior Leadership in order to use transdisciplinary, translational, and transformative research to address the following problems: With a rapidly aging population, 40 million Americans over the age of 65 are alive today and 390,000 will die from cancer this year. In 15 years, approximately, 74 million Americans of this age will be alive and cancer mortality will be ~730,000/year. The present methods by which new cancer therapies have been developed have met with a disappointing failure rate; therefore, improved translational methods are needed. So too are integrated programs that combine physical sciences, biomedical technology, and functional imaging to develop new therapies and delivery modalities as well as methods for functional evaluation and enhanced detection to determine, in a non-toxic fashion, if therapies will work. Two main foci are used to address these problems:  1) Reducing disparities in the cancer burden  2) Tackling advanced cancer by adapting molecularly targeted therapy through our patient derived  xenograft program (PDX) and canine patients to truly develop personalized medicine. Each of these uses a multi-disciplinary approach, combining expertise from across programs (Molecular Oncology, Comparative Oncology, Cancer Therapeutics, Population Sciences and Health Disparities, Prostate Urothelial Cancer, and Biomedical Technology), leveraging the UC Davis expertise (e.g., School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Biological Sciences, Department of Biomedical Technology), and with external partners (the Jackson Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Foundation Medicine). Seven Innovation Groups enhance collaborative interactions and proposals with focus on translating basic and technological findings into grants and investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Beyond that, the UCDCCC’s robust clinical trials program enables these discoveries to be translated into patient benefits. The portfolio consist of NCI awards to fund Phase I, II, and III trials, COG and NCI Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium trials, and a strong portfolio of IITs. These are implemented by a cadre of clinical scientists (11 of whom were recruited in the past funding period) who function as the interface of translational and clinical research. The catchment area (13 counties surrounding Sacramento county) is benefited through, among other activities, a city-wide early phase clinical trials program and the UCDCCC Cancer Care Network, through which the resources and expertise of a comprehensive cancer center are brought to disadvantaged and rural areas while keeping patients in their home communities. Finally, in this world of ever-changing cancer care delivery models, combined with an increasing numbers of patients seeking help and increasing complexities of treatments available, we are building a robust cancer supportive/psycho oncology program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer and its effects are an ever-increasing problem at the population and individual levels. The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center's research is aimed at reducing this burden through cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment that is truly precision and personalized. Unique research strategies include the use of patient-derived xenografts, canine clinical trials, and state-of-the-art imaging, all of which is focused on translating discoveries into innovative clinical trials that ultimately improve the lives of patients and families with cancer.",Cancer Center Support Grant P30,9757292,P30CA093373,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' domestic dog ', ' canine ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' Dogs ', ' Canine Species ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Patients ', ' physical science ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Veterinary Schools ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Talents ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Veterinary Medicine ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Generations ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' Transcend ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' molecular oncology ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' member ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Modality ', ' Biomedical Technology ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Genome Stability ', ' Genomic Stability ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Detection ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' CCSG ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' P30 Grant ', ' P30 Award ', ' Cancer Grant Supplements ', ' Cancer Grant Supplements (P30) ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Molecular ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Oncogenic ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' comparative ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' population health ', ' oncology program ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' improved outcome ', ' molecular targeted treatment ', ' molecular targeted therapeutics ', ' molecular targeted therapies ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' recruit ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' care delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' Service delivery model ', ' oncology trial ', ' investigator-initiated trial ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P30,2018,200000,0.015294446579397119
"Disparities in the Availability of Cancer Clinical Trials: A Multi-level Analysis Disparities in the Availability of Cancer Clinical Trials: A Multi-level Analysis Participation of minority populations in cancer clinical trials is vital to ensure generalizability of the results generated, facilitate discovery of novel therapies and therapeutic responses that are particularly relevant to traditionally underrepresented populations, and ensure equitable access to new and promising treatments. Yet more than twenty years after Congress mandated that the NIH ensure `sufficient and appropriate' participation of minorities in clinical research, the participation rate of many minority populations remains substantially lower than the composition of the overall US population. Disparities in access to cancer clinical trials are a chief barrier to reducing disparities in trial participation. Thus it is critical to understand the role that geographic variation plays in driving disparities in access to cancer clinical trials if we are to design and target effective interventions to improve minority participation in such trials. Prior studies have had limited success in teasing apart the complex mix of site- and health care system-level factors that influence the availability of different types of cancer clinical trials for minority populations for two chief reasons. First, we currently lack a comprehensive database of sufficiently detailed trial-level characteristics or information about the locations where trials are launched because of the difficulty in synthesizing such information from multiple sources using traditional record linkage methods. As such, prior studies evaluating disparities in the availability of cancer clinical trials have been importantly limited in the range of factors examined and the number and type of trials studied. Second, cancer clinical trials are often launched at multiple sites that operate within larger healthcare systems, and individual recruiting sites often participate in multiple trials, which pose methodological challenges to disentangling the associations between various trial-, site-, and health care system-level factors on cancer clinical trial availability. We propose to address these challenges by integrating information from multiple sources using advanced record linkage methods and applying sophisticated modeling techniques to analyze the resulting multilevel data. The proposed study will improve understanding of how the availability of cancer clinical trials varies across geographic settings and the clinical trials portfolio, which could help target interventions and policies to address disparities in access to the areas most in need. This project will also lay the scientific foundation for a planned future study to predict enrollment of patient populations traditionally underrepresented in clinical research in publicly funded cancer clinical trials. Participation of minority populations in cancer clinical trials is vital to ensure generalizability of the results generated, facilitate discovery of novel therapies and therapeutic responses that are particularly relevant to traditionally underrepresented populations, and ensure equitable access to new and promising treatments. Yet the participation rate of many minority populations remains substantially lower than the composition of the overall US population.

"VCU Massey Cancer Center Minority Based NCI Community Oncology Research Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Massey Cancer Center (MCC) will serve as the primary component site for an NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site (MB-NCORP) UM-1 award in partnership with nine collaborating community component sites. The overall objectives of this partnership are to extend novel, innovative, and effective minority recruitment approaches to an expanded base of community component sites, increase opportunities for minority and medically underserved individuals to participate in Cancer Clinical Trial Research (CCTR), and to integrate Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) into the overall MB-NCORP. Accordingly, the specific aims of this proposal are to (1) establish a research infrastructure that will further enable community component sites to conduct CCTR with an emphasis on trials relevant to minority and medically underserved populations, (2) conduct NCI-approved CCTR at the MCC primary component site and throughout the community component sites, and (3) integrate Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) into the overall MB-NCORP. The research design of the MB-NCORP offers a full menu of cancer studies including those in cancer prevention and control, screening, treatment, imaging, and CCDR. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of the NCI as MCC and the community component sites will bring cancer clinical trials and research to low-income, minority, and medically underserved individuals who otherwise would not have access to such studies. These studies will address many diverse factors from patient, provider, organizational, and policy perspectives that contribute to known disparities in cancer detection, treatment, and outcomes. Targeting the minority/underserved populations in their communities is a critical step toward alleviating the cancer care disparities prevalent in these populations. The proposed research is relevant to public health as it will bring cancer clinical trials and cancer care  delivery research to minority and underserved individuals in their own communities. The inclusion of these  individuals in the research will both broaden the applicability of the research and help to reduce the health  cancer disparities in the minority and underserved populations of cancer patients.",VCU Massey Cancer Center Minority Based NCI Community Oncology Research Program,9533503,UG1CA189869,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Award ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Evolution ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Hematology ', ' Hospitals ', ' Institutes ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Leadership ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' United States Department of Veterans Affairs ', ' Veterans Administration ', ' United States Veterans Administration ', ' Universities ', ' Virginia ', ' Washington ', ' Organizational Policy ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' news ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' social ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' cancer site ', ' cancer location ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Clinical Oncology ', ' Gynecologic Oncology ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Cancer Center ', ' Collection ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' health related quality of life ', ' effectiveness research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' safety net ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' medically underserved ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' patient population ', ' infrastructure development ', ' screening ', ' Minority Enrollment ', ' recruiting minorities ', ' Minority Recruitment ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' underserved minority ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCI,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,UG1,2018,1294605,0.08771784793114917
"Columbia University Minority/Underserved Site NCI Community Oncology Research Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site will be based at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC), the home of cancer research at Columbia University Medical Center in the City of New York. The HICCC, located in Washington Heights where >50% of the local residents are foreign-born, including a large Dominican population, has had a commitment and interest in research and service to this community and to the underserved in general that spans decades, predating its recognition as a national priority. Our specific objectives are: 1) to provide a menu of NCl-sponsored Cooperative Group trials to our investigators, including those in the local medical community, for screening, prevention, cancer control, and treatments; 2) to establish close relationships with the NCI Clinical Cooperative Groups to enhance the benefits of clinical research, especially in cancer care delivery research; 3) to attract and educate potential study participants, especially minorities, about participation in cancer clinical research; 4) expand the HICCC Cancer Prevention, Control and Disparities program's current focus on quality of care of cancer, especially as related to disparities of race/ethnicity, age, income, insurance and other factors. Through utilization of the existing HICCC shared resources, Recruitment and Retention of Minorities Office and Clinical Protocol and Data Management Office, 3267 subjects including 2681 minority participants, have been recruited to NCI or externally peer reviewed studies in the past 5 years. With a NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site award, outreach to a broader range of participants will be expanded by 1) supporting recruitment to a wider range of oncology subspecialty trials, especially given the planned expansion of clinical oncology services  and 2) allow activation of more cancer control/prevention studies. This will facilitate a comprehensive approach across the disease and age spectrum, and across treatments, and will facilitate the prioritization of cancer care delivery research studies, in conjunction with the scientific expertise available at HICCC. As such, the range of organ/site specialties for which we provide services to investigators will be broadened thus allowing enrollment of still more minority patients in a wider range of cancer research trials.

"Alliance NCORP Research Base DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Alliance NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base conducts interventional and observational clinical trials as well as database analyses addressing important questions concerning cancer prevention, screening, symptom intervention, post-treatment surveillance/survivorship, quality of life and cancer care delivery. We place special emphasis upon issues affecting minority, underserved and elderly patient groups, and upon building strong collegial relationships with NCORP Community sites and Minority/Underserved Community sites. The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance), one of the five National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) groups, serves as the coordinating center for the conduct of all NCORP Research Base trials. The Alliance members represent community practices and academic medical centers in approximately equal number, so the results of the trials broadly reflect the actual experience of patients across the United States. In order to improve our understanding of the biological basis of cancer risk and pre-malignant disease, biomarkers that detect pre-symptomatic newly diagnosed or recurrent malignancies, as well as the physiologic mechanisms of cancer-related symptoms and treatment-related toxicities, most of our clinical trials include translational research questions requiring the collection of tumor tissue, premalignant tissue samples, blood, or other human biospecimens. These biospecimens create an invaluable repository for understanding the associations between laboratory and clinical observations. The Alliance NCORP Research Base collaborates broadly with other NCORP Research Bases to enroll patients in trials, conduct translational studies, and share data and biospecimens for pooled analyses. We also collaborate broadly with other NCI-funded investigators and consortia, as well as investigators supported through non-NCI sources. Results of Alliance investigator efforts have resulted in more than 99 abstracts and manuscripts over the past five years, many resulting in significant beneficial changes in clinical practice. The scientific questions answered by the Alliance NCORP Research Base represent meaningful and innovative contributions to biomedical sciences, and can only be addressed through a publicly-funded research network. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately one in three women and one in two men in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime. Research to prevent cancer, detect cancer while it is still curable, improve symptoms related to cancer and its treatment, and enhance cancer care delivery strategies will provide major health and economic benefits for Americans and people around the world.",Alliance NCORP Research Base,9538056,UG1CA189823,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Geriatric Assessment ', ' geriatric screening ', ' Elderly Assessment ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Columbus NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need for high quality cancer care in the United States is ever increasing, but the system is in distress.  An aging population will increase demand for services at a at time when rising costs, uneven accessibility,  anticipated workforce shortages and a lack of evidence based cancer care delivery solutions have put the  system into crisis. This was the conclusion of an Institute of Medicine (lOM) committee report which recently published a number of recommendations in ""Delivering High-Quality Cancer Care: Charting a New Course for a System in Crisis"", Washington DC, National Academies Press, 2013"". The important role for clinical trials especially in the area of comparative effectiveness research, an the translation of results into clinical practice was emphasized by the lOM committee. The new National Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) is poised to engage this recommendation and the Columbus CCOP/NCORP with our experience in cancer care delivery research and educational programs to translate research results to care-givers is uniquely suited to this task. We have continued our reputation for innovation by adapting our existing infrastructure in the design of an integrated cancer care delivery research program involving our 3 major hospitals, coordinated by a team headed by a physician with experience in this area. Our history of extensive community interactions will enhance this effort. The Columbus CCOP/NCORP is indeed ready to join with the NCORP as we forge an innovative evidence-based, patient-centered cancer care delivery system.

"Implementing Palliative Care: Learning Collaborative vs. Technical Assistance Project Summary    The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommends “…combined standard oncology care and  palliative care…early in the course of illness for any patient with metastatic cancer and/or high symptom  burden”. Unfortunately, early palliative care is not routinely incorporated into treatment plans at the onset of  advanced diagnosis, thereby depriving patients of potential quality of life benefits, especially low access  populations including minorities and rural-­dwellers. The problem is that we do not know how to best assist  health systems wanting to integrate early palliative care services into their usual oncology care. Virtual  Learning Collaboratives (VLCs), comprised of multiple health systems that work together virtually to implement  an evidence-­based practice, offer a solution. VLC features include the formation of quality improvement teams,  group problem solving, and data reporting/feedback. Despite widespread use of VLCs in healthcare, few  studies have evaluated their effectiveness. To address this gap, we propose to test the effectiveness of a VLC  implementation strategy on integration of an evidenced-­based model of early concurrent oncology palliative  care called ENABLE (Educate, Nurture, Advise, Before Life Ends). ENABLE is the only evidence-­based,  scalable early palliative care model promoted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Research Tested  Intervention Program. Guided by the RE-­AIM framework and using Proctor’s Outcomes for Implementation  Research model, we propose a cluster-­randomized trial with 48 NCI Community Oncology Research Program  (NCORP) practices implementing ENABLE to evaluate the effectiveness of a Virtual Learning Collaborative  (VLC) compared to typical implementation consisting of limited technical assistance (TA). In this hybrid type III  design implementation effectiveness trial, we will compare two implementation strategies in real world  oncology practices to determine Implementation (ENABLE uptake), Service, and Patient outcomes. Study aims  are: 1) Compare the effectiveness of VLC vs. TA on ENABLE program uptake, measured as the proportion of  patients at participating NCORP practices who complete the ENABLE program;; 2) Compare the effectiveness  of VLC vs. TA on NCORP practices implementation teams’ fidelity to ENABLE and assigned implementation  strategy;; 3) Compare NCORP practices randomized to VLC or TA on patient and caregiver quality of life (QOL)  and mood outcomes;; and 4) Determine the relationship between ENABLE program uptake and fidelity and  patients’ QOL and mood across the two strategies. This research will impact public health by addressing a  knowledge gap on appropriate strategies to implement scalable evidence-­based palliative care practices while  reducing the disparity of sub-­optimal cancer care for advanced cancer patients.

"Development of a research infrastructure for understanding and addressing multiple melanoma disparities. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC), a consortium with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), is a matrix organization under the aegis of the UC Davis Health System and University of California, Davis. Two hundred and four members are organized into six programs, supported by eight shared resources, and led by Senior Leadership in order to use transdisciplinary, translational, and transformative research to address the following problems: With a rapidly aging population, 40 million Americans over the age of 65 are alive today and 390,000 will die from cancer this year. In 15 years, approximately, 74 million Americans of this age will be alive and cancer mortality will be ~730,000/year. The present methods by which new cancer therapies have been developed have met with a disappointing failure rate; therefore, improved translational methods are needed. So too are integrated programs that combine physical sciences, biomedical technology, and functional imaging to develop new therapies and delivery modalities as well as methods for functional evaluation and enhanced detection to determine, in a non-toxic fashion, if therapies will work. Two main foci are used to address these problems:  1) Reducing disparities in the cancer burden  2) Tackling advanced cancer by adapting molecularly targeted therapy through our patient derived  xenograft program (PDX) and canine patients to truly develop personalized medicine. Each of these uses a multi-disciplinary approach, combining expertise from across programs (Molecular Oncology, Comparative Oncology, Cancer Therapeutics, Population Sciences and Health Disparities, Prostate Urothelial Cancer, and Biomedical Technology), leveraging the UC Davis expertise (e.g., School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Biological Sciences, Department of Biomedical Technology), and with external partners (the Jackson Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Foundation Medicine). Seven Innovation Groups enhance collaborative interactions and proposals with focus on translating basic and technological findings into grants and investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Beyond that, the UCDCCC’s robust clinical trials program enables these discoveries to be translated into patient benefits. The portfolio consist of NCI awards to fund Phase I, II, and III trials, COG and NCI Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium trials, and a strong portfolio of IITs. These are implemented by a cadre of clinical scientists (11 of whom were recruited in the past funding period) who function as the interface of translational and clinical research. The catchment area (13 counties surrounding Sacramento county) is benefited through, among other activities, a city-wide early phase clinical trials program and the UCDCCC Cancer Care Network, through which the resources and expertise of a comprehensive cancer center are brought to disadvantaged and rural areas while keeping patients in their home communities. Finally, in this world of ever-changing cancer care delivery models, combined with an increasing numbers of patients seeking help and increasing complexities of treatments available, we are building a robust cancer supportive/psycho oncology program.

"Northwest NCI Community Oncology Research Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer affects 1.6 million Americans in the US each year. Over 37,000 Washington State residents are diagnosed with cancer each year and it has been the overall leading cause of death since 2004. In 2012, cancer was responsible for 12,170 deaths and accounted for approximately 24% of all deaths statewide.  Since 1983, the NCI has extended cancer research into the community and facilitated the translation of research into evidenced based practice through the Community Clinical Oncology Programs (CCOPs). For the past 30 years, cancer patients in the Pacific Northwest have had access to NCI funded oncology clinical  trials via two large community based research networks: Northwest CCOP and Virginia Mason CCOP.  These two highly experienced CCOPs share a 30 year history as separate, but adjacent CCOPs and have joined to form the Northwest NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NW NCORP).  The NW NCORP recognizes the critical contributions that community cancer research programs occupy in clinical research continuum. According to the NCI about 85% of cancer patients are treated in or near their communities. Community hospitals keep patients close to family, friends, and jobs, while treatment at major Cancer Centers may require extended commutes or long stays away from home. Our service orientation and position in the cancer research design-implement-delivery continuum demands collaboration with likeminded community-based entities and modernization of our ability to connect to diverse patient populations  and other stakeholders. With our fundamental principle of clinical research collaboration and cancer care  delivery, the specific aims of the NW NCORP community site are: (1) Accelerate access to clinical trials in  ""real-world"" healthcare delivery settings for cancer patients across the lifespan (pediatrics, adolescent and  young adults, and adults); (2) Build infrastructure for the cancer care delivery research program (CCDR) in  preparation for the capacity to conduct CCDR clinical trials across the NW NCORP Network; and (3)  Develop active strategies for enhancing interaction with NCI-supported programs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a network of community hospitals, clinics, and multidisciplinary providers focused on the entire spectrum of cancer patients (pediatrics to aging adults), the NW NCORP offers a ""real-world"" setting for cancer  patients to access new and emerging medical treatments and supportive care via a national clinical research  network.",Northwest NCI Community Oncology Research Program,9535227,UG1CA189952,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Commuting ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Family ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Leadership ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Modernization ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Pacific Northwest ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' United States ', ' Virginia ', ' Washington ', ' Friends ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' outreach ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' cancer care ', ' Enhancement Technology ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Clinical Oncology ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Communication Tools ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Preparation ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Mind ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' social media ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' ']",NCI,TACOMA GENERAL HOSPITAL,UG1,2018,911465,0.0892783382825916
"Sanford Community Cancer Program of the North Central Plains DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rural communities of the upper Midwest and Central Plains represent a large underserved population for cancer treatment, care delivery and clinical trials. The causes of this difference are multi-factorial but a main obstacle is access to services in rural regional areas. Sanford Health has developed a network of hospitals, cancer centers and clinics to provide high quality multi-disciplinary cancer treatment, clinical trials, ad cancer care delivery to this underserved area. It is hypothesized that this disparity in care for this rural population can be improved by utilizing the organized Sanford Community Cancer Program (SCCP) network community.  This proposal describes the NCI NCORP partnership to help deliver clinical trials and cancer care delivery across the rural area the SCCP serves. This will be accomplished through the following aims:  1. /Maintain and enhance robust accrual to NCI Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) supported clinical trials through our five primary components.  2. Address disparities in clinical trial accrual in underserved and underrepresented populations to increase participation.  3. Cultivate Innovative access points to address barriers to clinical trial accrual through outreach and telemedicine.  4. Develop a Cancer Care Delivery infrastructure.  Through these four aims the Sanford Community Cancer Program will transform implementation of state of the art clinical trials, cancer treatment and cancer care delivery to approximately two million people across parts of five states living in rura America. Many of these people are more than 2 hours from the nearest community cancer center, a situation complicated by 4 to 6 months of harsh weather, which can make travel unpredictable and often dangerous. The ability to provide cancer care, including clinical trials, through outreach and telemedicine to this underserved rural population in their local communities ensures timely, optimal treatment and improved outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: the Sanford Community Cancer Program will continue to offer NCI clinical trials and provide state-of-the-art cancer treatment and cancer care delivery to approximately two million people across six states ability to provide clinical trials through outreach and telemedicine to this underserved rural population of patients increases their opportunity for participation in a trial as a treatment option.

"Gulf South Minority-based NCI Community Oncology Research Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Gulf South-Minority Based-NCI Community Oncology Research Program (GS-MB-NCORP) brings together an integrated clinical trials program from two Minority Based CCOPs (MBCCOP) and an NCCCP site in the state of Louisiana, supported by well-established and funded Cancer Care Delivery Research and programs in Health Disparities and Community-Based Participatory Research. The MBCCOP established by the LSU School of Medicine in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO-MBCCOP) and its NCCCP partner, the Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center - Our Lady of the Lake Hospital (MBP-OLOL) in Baton Rouge, have joined the MBCCOP at the LSU School of Medicine in Shreveport (LSUHSC-SH-MBCCOP) in northwest Louisiana to create the GS-MB-NCORP. This consortium integrates well-established and experienced teams of clinicians and researchers with the aim of expanding access to state-of-the-art cancer clinical trials to the patients we serve, through a network of leading academic and community hospitals. Louisiana has one of the poorest survival rates for cancer patients in the United States, despite not having the highest incidence for all types of the disease. This is particularly true for underserved and minority patients, clealy reflecting a major health disparity. Possible explanations for this disparity range from socio-economic and access to health care, to poorly understood genetic and biological differences. The LSU MBCCOPs and the NCCCP at MBP-OLOL have independently worked to increase access to clinical trials for minority and underserved communities, establish outreach and education programs, and expand Cancer Care Delivery Research and Health Disparity studies. In the fall of 2012, we agreed to combine our strengths and experience into the GS-MB-NCORP with the goal of having a more significant impact on cancer associated health disparities by integrating our clinical trials programs and incorporating Cancer Care Delivery and Health Disparity researchers into the clinical trials process. The GS-MB-NCORP's goals are to increase the participation of minorities and underserved populations in clinical trials, identify barriers t participation, and incorporate the community in the research studies. To achieve this, we propose the following Specific Aims. 1) Advance an integrated system of access to cancer clinical trials that promote and facilitate the participation and enrollment of patients, in particlar underserved and minority populations in Louisiana. 2) Promote Cancer Care Delivery Research Programs to ensure our ability to participate in research initiatives proposed by the Research Bases, and eventually design protocols that improve the care of our patients. 3) Expand Health Disparities Research programs through community engagement to increase the participation of minority and underserved populations in clinical trials The GS-MB-NCORP will contribute significantly to the agenda o fthe National Cancer Institute and the  Research Bases, by increasing access to prevention, early detection and cutting edge clinical trials to  minority and underserved patients in Louisiana.

"A multi-level mixed methods examination of treatment non-adherence among rural oncology patients Project Summary. The nearly 3 million US cancer survivors residing in rural areas experience 10% higher cancer mortality compared to their urban counterparts, in part due to poorer cancer treatment adherence. Reasons for rural-urban disparities in cancer treatment adherence are not fully understood. The majority of research to-date has focused on health claims data and small-sample survey data. Moreover, extant data has often neglected the protective and enabling factors that are characteristic of rural communities. A deeper understanding of factors driving cancer treatment non-adherence in rural populations is necessary to design targeted, asset-based interventions to reduce rural health disparities and improve outcomes. The premise of the proposed research is that multi-level factors contribute to the observed rural-urban differences in cancer treatment adherence and outcomes, including sociodemographic inequities and diminished access to healthcare, psychosocial services, and technological advances. Rural cultural factors serve as barriers and facilitators to treatment adherence and may be positively impacted by digitally-mediated interventions. The purpose of the proposed research is to elucidate social and behavioral factors encompassing rural culture as it relates to oncology treatment non-adherence and delineate factors amenable to targeted, tailored approaches to improve rural oncology outcomes. These goals will be accomplished by a rigorous mixed methods approach utilizing population-based surveys, semi-structured interviews, and ecological momentary assessment, supported by community engagement across study phases to capitalize on strengths of rural culture while minimizing barriers. A highly qualified multi-disciplinary team has been assembled to support my research and training goals in mixed methodology and rural community engagement. The proposed F99/K00 application targets the NCI's emerging priority of rural cancer control and aligns with current NCI funding initiatives in rural oncology and implementation science. Completion of this unique pre to post-doctoral fellowship transition award will provide me with the skills and experience necessary to be a highly trained cancer control researcher with specific expertise in 1) rural populations, 2) health disparities, 3) patterns of care, and 4) care coordination and delivery - four of the seven NCI Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences areas of research emphasis, thus expertly preparing me to advance the field of rural cancer control through the development of innovative and scalable interventions addressing the self-management support needs of this underserved population.

"Linking population-based data sources to examine health disparities in clinical trial participation and outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  We propose a feasibility study to support the creation of a population-based data resource that has the potential for detailed, insightful studies about the practice and impact of cancer clinical trials. In 2000, the U.S. National Library of Medicine resource ClinicalTrials.gov was made publicly available. This resource contains details of clinical trials sponsored by the NIH, other Federal agencies, and non-profit and private organizations, including cancer clinical trials. In September 2008, Medicare claims were modified to include an identifier for the clinical trial to which a patient is enrolled, the National Clinical Trial (NCT) identifier. This is the same identifier used by ClinicalTrials.gov. In 2014, reporting of the NCT identifier became mandatory for all claims submitted to Medicare for clinical trial related services. Thus, from 2014 onwards, it is theoretically possible to identify nearly all Fee-for-Service (FFS) Medicare patients who are registered on a cancer clinical trial. It should also be possible to link these patients with detailed clinical trial information from ClinicalTrials.gov using the NCT identifier. These Medicare claims have been linked to other data sources such as the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program cancer registry and databases with information on hospitals and physicians. Therefore, it should be possible to create a resource that tracks Medicare participants on clinical trials for outcomes such as survival, hospitalizations, and costs. It would also link individual patients and their treating physicians and hospitals with details of the clinical trial.  If this resource proves as successful as hypothesized, it would have immense opportunity for providing population-based information about clinical trials in the U.S., specifically covering questions related to disparities. However, its potential value extends far beyond the study of cancer disparities. The kinds of population-based questions that could be addressed include: What are the institutional and provider characteristics associated with trial enrollment overall and among underrepresented groups? Is the lower enrollment of black and Hispanic patients on cancer trials due to these patients being treated at institutions with limited or no availability of trials? What is the distance from participant home to the nearest available trial site and how does this differ by patient characteristics? These and other pressing research questions are only possible to address if the record linkage is successful and the data quality is adequate. Thus, the purpose of this proposal is to assess the feasibility of creating this linked data resource. In Aim 1, we will create the record linkages and assemble details about the trials, patients, providers, and outcomes. In Aim 2, we will examine carefully the validity of the crucial linkages that define the proposed new resource. In Aim 3, we will generate data to address three exemplar questions regarding disparities, and map out a more exhaustive set of feasible research questions that would shed light on important aspects of the U.S. clinical trials enterprise. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this proposal is to create a national database that will tell us about older adult patients who have participated in clinical trials. This will allow us to answer questions about what kinds of people participate in these trials, where they are treated, what doctors treat them, and the benefits and risks of such participation, which can influence the future of clinical trials research.",Linking population-based data sources to examine health disparities in clinical trial participation and outcomes,9823088,R21CA235154,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Future ', ' Gold ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Hospitals ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Oncology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Medical Library ', ' National Library of Medicine ', ' United States National Library of Medicine ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Privatization ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Work ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Data Quality ', ' SEER Program ', ' Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program ', ' Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results ', ' SEER-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Fees for Service ', ' exhaustion ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Services ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' cancer registry ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Clinical Oncology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Policy Research ', ' Qualifying ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Medicare claim ', ' population based ', ' National Clinical Trials Network ', ' NCI National Clinical Trials Network ', ' Minority Enrollment ', ' individual patient ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' data resource ', ' insurance claims ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R21,2019,234378,0.07879068814634263
"Wisconsin NCI Community Oncology Research Program (WiNCORP) PROJECT SUMMARY The Wisconsin NCORP (WiNCORP) is a consortium of three established healthcare systems in the state of Wisconsin with a long-standing history of excellence in oncology care – Marshfield Clinic Health System, Gundersen Health System, and ThedaCare. Through a network of hospitals, clinics, and other facilities spanning most of the state of Wisconsin, upper Michigan and adjacent counties in Northern Iowa and Southeastern Minnesota, WiNCORP institutions collectively provide care and access to oncology clinical trials to a predominantly rural population. Member sites participate in numerous NCI-sponsored clinical trials and are active in NCORP research base committees, NCI task forces and steering committees, research networks, and organizations with a focus on improving cancer care. Investigators from each system are consistently recognized by the NCI and/or the research bases for their accrual totals, and WiNCORP has been designated as a high-performing site over the previous grant cycle. Through the work of multidisciplinary care teams and research staff, WiNCORP will continue to leverage its collective expertise to open numerous cancer care delivery research (CCDR) trials. With a shared mission to provide patient access to NCI-sponsored clinical trials, WiNCORP members are well-positioned to increase patient accruals from historically underrepresented populations in clinical trials such as rural, elderly, and low-income individuals, enhance cancer care delivery, and reduce disparities in cancer burden across the region. To achieve this goal, WiNCORP leadership has outlined four specific aims for the consortium: 1) Conduct NCI Phase I/II, II and III cancer screening, prevention, symptom management, treatment, post-treatment, imaging and quality of life trials across the entire WiNCORP service area. 2) Facilitate conduct of Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) across our integrated health care systems through establishment of an expanded research infrastructure. 3) Facilitate accrual to molecular target driven trials. 4) Incorporate a new patient population and provider group in the WiNCORP consortium that currently has no access to CCDR studies. These specific aims will be accomplished by expanding communication channels between patients and WiNCORP members, streamlining the process of site opening for various clinical trials, enhancing resource sharing among member sites, enhancing community engagement in clinical trial participation, and continual enhancements and developments in infrastructure and personnel to open and accrue patients to a variety of clinical trial types. It is anticipated that WiNCORP-wide efforts in staff education, clinical trial feasibility assessment, harmonized internal processes, synchronized regulatory support, development of system and trial-specific standard operating procedures, and collaboration among investigators from the three consortium sites will create a synergy that will further enhance clinical trial conduct, efficiency, and quality. PROJECT NARRATIVE WiNCORP represents a collaborative effort among three healthcare systems that provide oncology care to a predominantly rural population in Wisconsin, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Northeastern Iowa, and Southeastern Minnesota. Member sites have developed multidisciplinary care teams and research staff to accrue numerous patients to NCI-sponsored trials and encourage collaboration through participation in regional research networks and affiliations with academic medical centers. WiNCORP will continue to provide patient access to NCI-sponsored clinical trials and influence oncology practice patterns in the region through the conduct and publication of cancer care delivery research (CCDR) projects.",Wisconsin NCI Community Oncology Research Program (WiNCORP),9773507,UG1CA189956,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Service area ', ' Health Catchment Area ', ' Health Service Area ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Foxes ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', ' Iowa ', ' Leadership ', ' Michigan ', ' Minnesota ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rural Population ', ' survivorship ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Caring ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' integrated healthcare systems ', ' integrated health system ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' care delivery ', ' synergism ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' research study ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Clinical Oncology ', ' Low income ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ', ' ECOG ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' American College of Radiology Imaging Network ', ' ACRIN ', ' American College of Surgeons Oncology Group ', ' ACOSOG ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' North Central Cancer Treatment Group ', ' NCCTG ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient population ', ' Systems Development ', ' screening ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' service programs ', ' feasibility trial ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,MARSHFIELD CLINIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION,UG1,2019,2585066,0.16499248601416766
"Montana Cancer Consortium: An Inclusive and Collaborative Approach to Clinical Trial Accrual and Cancer Care Delivery Research across Montana, Idaho and Wyoming PROJECT SUMMARY The Montana Cancer Consortium (MCC) is an independent, nonprofit organization whose mission is to bring state-of-the-art cancer care to Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming through National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored clinical research.

In addition, MCC helps to design and influence cancer care delivery research through continued participation that informs and speeds validated care innovations into clinical practice. The region has been characterized as `mega-rural' with limited access to care due to the vastness of the geography, lack of university-based treatment and research facilities, and lack of primary care providers. Montana, Idaho and Wyoming are home to seven, five, and one American Indian Reservations respectively, where issues of poverty, distance, and cultural taboos surrounding cancer care discussion and treatment create unique disparities to prevention, early diagnosis, treatment and survivorship of cancer. The overall goal of MCC is to increase access to clinical trials in the service area while improving the delivery of cancer care through research. This is accomplished through inclusiveness of membership, communication, education, a commitment to quality, and participation in national clinical trial initiatives. The MCC NCORP Community Site consists of 10 primary affiliate sites and nine sub-affiliates that collectively serve nearly two million residents in an area covering over 200,000 square miles. Membership includes 60 oncology investigators representing all cancer care specialty areas. MCC is a member in good standing with the four adult research bases, and is poised to provide and support expanded access to state-of-the-art cancer treatment, control, prevention, screening, surveillance and care delivery through NCI-sponsored clinical trials. Strong leadership, an involved network of member physicians and dedicated affiliate sites strengthens MCC as an NCORP Community Site. PROJECT NARRATIVE Montana Cancer Consortium exists to maximize access to clinical trials and research through centralized services and support for member physicians and affiliate sites that might not otherwise offer access to these critical opportunities. The uniquely rural and medically underserved population of Montana, Northern Idaho and Northern Wyoming offers stimulating challenges for implementing NCI-sponsored clinical trials and care delivery research. The collective experience of the affiliate sites in successful clinical trial enrollment and care delivery research in the vastly rural area will benefit NCORP's diversity and disparity goals.","Montana Cancer Consortium: An Inclusive and Collaborative Approach to Clinical Trial Accrual and Cancer Care Delivery Research across Montana, Idaho and Wyoming",9771796,UG1CA189872,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Service area ', ' Health Catchment Area ', ' Health Service Area ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Cancer Hospital ', ' Idaho ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Montana ', ' Non-Profit Organizations ', ' Nonprofit Organizations ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Taboo ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Wyoming ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Medical Oncologist ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' research facility ', ' care delivery ', ' Speed ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Indian reservation ', ' tribal reservation ', ' reservation community ', ' native american reservation ', ' nation reservation ', ' American Indian reservation ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' response ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Address ', ' Gynecologic Oncologist ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Radiation Oncologist ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinical care ', ' clinical practice ', ' oncology program ', ' screening ', ' collaborative approach ', ' rurality ', ' rural environment ', ' rural Americans ', ' rural dwellers ', ' rural resident ', ' rural underserved ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' ']",NCI,MONTANA CANCER CONSORTIUM,UG1,2019,940023,0.14432159514442464
"Carle Cancer Center NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) SUMMARY ABSTRACT Carle Cancer Center in Urbana, Illinois, a current NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), is applying for renewed funding to continue its commitment to provide cancer prevention, control, screening, and care delivery research in the community setting. Joining in our efforts are affiliate institutions, Rush-Copley Medical Center in Aurora, Illinois and St. Vincent Anderson in Anderson, Indiana. Together, the NCORP affiliate institutions' objectives are to engage institutions and communities in the participation of research to advance all aspects of cancer care. The goal is to optimize the personal and institutional advances in health care through research that becomes readily transferable across other health care systems and populations for the benefit of all. The Carle NCORP is devoted to engage all members and communities to be represented in clinical and translational research. Over the next six years, the Carle NCORP will continue to recruit, train, and mentor any population or health system in the region to similarly participate in clinical research. Carle's strength is its highly integrated health care system, from top to bottom (organizationally and electronically), comprised of 928 primary care and specialty providers, all invested in a research culture. The Carle NCORP's three main strengths are cancer control, prevention, and care delivery research, novel imaging, and capabilities to acquire bio-specimens. Attributes in place to ensure a successful NCORP include:  • Over 35 years of community research oncology experience  • Multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional integration  • Significant rural and diverse population in eastern Illinois and portions of Indiana  • High accrual particularly with cancer control, prevention, and care delivery trials  • Cross discipline research initiatives at Carle Foundation Hospital, Rush Copley, and St. Vincent Anderson  • Stephens Family Clinical Research Institute infrastructure and support  • Institutional support for the underserved and for the research program as a whole  • Affiliation with academic centers  • Initiatives for imaging, bio-specimen, electronic data mining  • High quality data  • Strong regulatory processes Project Narrative The Carle Cancer Center NCORP provides access to National Cancer Institute (NCI) clinical trials to the residents of eastern Illinois and portions of Indiana.

"Baptist Memorial Health Care/Mid South NCORP Minority Underserved Consortium The Baptist Memorial Health Care/Mid-South Minority Underserved NCORP is part of Baptist Memorial Healthcare Corporation (BMHCC), a non-for-profit faith-based healthcare system with 22 hospitals, 21 outpatient oncology clinics, 8 radiation facilities, and 19 outpatient infusion centers, providing care for approximately 8000 new cancer patients each year. BMHCC’s service area covers 111 counties, 4.3 million people. This is 44% of the 252 counties and parishes in the Delta Regional Authority, congressionally acknowledged as the most indigent population in the US. BMHCC provides 25% of cancer care in this racially, socioeconomically and culturally diverse region, which has some of the highest volumes of cancer and the most fragile public health infrastructure in the US. Before our NCORP, these patients had no access to clinical trials. In the 4 years since our NCORP began in August 2014, more than 90 patients per year have been enrolled into trials, including 168 patients in 2017/18; 39% of our enrolled patients are racial minorities, 17% reside in rural areas, 13% are uninsured, 21% have Medicaid. Members of our NCORP serve on multiple NCORP taskforces and NCI Steering Committees, including the Cancer Prevention Steering Committee. We have used our unique expertise in establishing Multidisciplinary Care Delivery programs in Breast, Thoracic, Gastrointestinal and Hematologic Oncology to develop Disease-Specific Research Groups that link our NCORP research closely to our clinical oncology care programs. This strategy has accelerated our progress in the past 2 years. Our system-wide implementation of the Electronic Health Record system, EPIC, has enhanced our research ability, especially in Cancer Care Delivery Research. For the new funding cycle, we propose to expand our NCORP research infrastructure across the full extent of BMHCC, with special emphasis on increasing patient recruitment across the state of Mississippi. Using Implementation and Team Science principles and a data-driven approach, our overarching goal is to increase the proportion of BMHCC oncology patients who participate in clinical trials from <3% in 2018 to 10% by 2025. With almost 8000 annual new cancer cases, this would significantly exceed the minimum requirements of the NCORP, to the benefit of our patients, communities and healthcare system, because we believe that ‘the best treatment is a clinical trial.’ Our specific aims are to increase the: 1.) number of active sites from 5 to 16 by 2025, by expanding to all our Mississippi institutions; 2.) proportion of oncology-related providers accruing patients to >90%; 3.) clinical trials activity in urogenital and gynecologic oncology; 4.) average annual patient-enrollment into NCORP trials from 90 to >250. Achieving our goal will help achieve the NCI’s mission of improving the health of this key US population demographic by narrowing a major recognized health disparity: poor access of the large indigent, racial minority and rural populations within the Mississippi Delta region to high quality oncologic care. The Baptist Memorial Health Care/Mid-South Minority Underserved NCORP is located in the Delta Regional Authority’s catchment area, serving the most indigent population in the US. We have successfully brought clinical trials access to this heavily underserved population, with 39% of our enrolled patients being racial minorities and 17% residing in rural areas, and 34% under-insured. We now seek to expand the reach of our NCORP to cover all of the state of Mississippi, Eastern Arkansas and West Tennessee, thereby providing greater access to the large indigent, racial minority and rural populations within the Mississippi Delta region.",Baptist Memorial Health Care/Mid South NCORP Minority Underserved Consortium,9773453,UG1CA189873,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Arkansas ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Service area ', ' Health Catchment Area ', ' Health Service Area ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Heel ', ' Hematology ', ' Hospitals ', ' Indigent ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mission ', ' Mississippi ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Private Practice ', ' Public Health ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' Science ', ' Tennessee ', ' Urogenital System ', ' Urogenital ', ' Genitourinary ', ' Genitourinary system ', ' County ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' forest ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Underinsured ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' Malignant neoplasm of thorax ', ' thoracic malignancies ', ' thoracic cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Thorax ', ' Malignant Thoracic Tumor ', ' Malignant Thoracic Neoplasm ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Active Sites ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Funding ', ' Oncologist ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Baptist Church ', ' Baptists ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' Infusion ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' authority ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Chest ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' Radiation ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Clinical Oncology ', ' Gynecologic Oncology ', ' Data ', ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ', ' ECOG ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' American College of Radiology Imaging Network ', ' ACRIN ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ', ' CTEP ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Southwest Oncology Group ', ' SWOG ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' inpatient service ', ' inpatient care ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' social health determinants ', ' underserved minority ', ' racial minority ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,BAPTIST MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - TIPTON,UG1,2019,1187214,0.11779594658415389
"Georgia NCI Community Oncology Research Program (GA NCORP) Project Summary This renewal application is for the statewide Georgia National Cancer Institute (NCI) Community Oncology Research Program (GA NCORP) Community Site, which represents a collaboration between the two largest community oncology clinical trial programs in Georgia, Northside Hospital Cancer Institute in Atlanta and the Nancy N. and J.C. Lewis Cancer & Research Pavilion at St. Joseph's/Candler in Savannah, and the Georgia Center for Oncology Research and Education (Georgia CORE) in Atlanta. Georgia CORE provides network affiliation for five contracted healthcare organizations across Georgia. In 2016, GA NCORP Affiliates together provided care to approximately 17,000 newly diagnosed patients with cancer and enrolled 1,198 patients to NCI-sponsored trials since August 2014. Through an integrated organizational and leadership structure, leading cancer researchers of GA NCORP are poised to build on a 29-year history of collaboration to further enhance the quality of cancer care in Georgia through improved access to NCI-sponsored trials and through the implementation of the goals of GA NCORP. The overall goal of GA NCORP is to bring cancer clinical research studies to individuals in their own communities through a statewide network utilizing shared infrastructure. This approach generates a broadly applicable evidence base that contributes to improved patient outcomes and a reduction in cancer disparities. Four specific aims are proposed to achieve the overall goal of GA NCORP: 1) to increase the number of eligible patients at risk for, or diagnosed with, cancer and who are provided access to, and enroll in, cancer clinical trials within their community; 2) to enroll participants from underrepresented populations across all study types and settings to reduce cancer disparities (populations include racial/ethnic minorities, sexual and gender minorities, adolescents, young adults, elderly, and rural residents); 3) to create a balanced trial portfolio between treatment trials and cancer control and prevention trials; and 4) to increase accrual and expand network-wide participation in cancer care delivery research. Achieving these aims will improve the quality of care in Georgia through increasing cancer research in local communities, identifying best practices for research accruals, and maximizing capacity and expertise for cancer research statewide. Project Narrative GA NCORP Community Site addresses two important challenges in US public health: expanding cancer research to a broader population and including underserved populations in cancer research. Advances in clinical care and scientific discovery are not currently equally available to all races and ethnic groups.

"Gulf South Minority/Underserved Clinical Trials Network (Gulf South M/U CTN) ABSTRACT The Gulf South Minority/Underserved – NCORP (GS-M/U-NCORP) and the Ochsner-Community-NCORP, the two NCORPs in Louisiana, have both met the objectives proposed for the last funding cycle, expanding access to and significantly increasing the number of patients participating in clinical trials in Louisiana and the Gulf South region. These successful NCORPs have agreed to come together to form the Gulf South Minority/Underserved Clinical Trials Network (Gulf South M/U CTN) NCORP, which will have as its primary affiliates the LSU – Cancer Center New Orleans (LSU-CC-New Orleans), LSU – Feist Weiller Cancer Center Shreveport (LSU-FWCC-Shreveport), Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center (MBPCC) and the Ochsner-Cancer Center (Ochsner). The new Gulf South M/U CTN will provide cancer care and access to clinical trials for >50% of new cancer cases in the region, expand the number of sites offering access to clinical trials from 22 to 42, and exceed the required 30% proportion of minority patients participating in NCORP trials. The Gulf South M/U CTN will bring additional resources including the Louisiana Tumor SEER registry (LTR-SEER) and the state-wide cancer screening programs such as the Louisiana Breast and Cervical Health Program (LBCHP), and the Louisiana Comprehensive Cancer Control Program (LCCCP). In addition we will benefit from ongoing research led by our investigators and aimed at understanding cancer inequities and disparities in our region. The new Gulf South M/U CTN has also expanded its network with major health providers in the region including the Veterans Administration Hospital (New Orleans), Woman's Hospital (the largest dedicated clinical center for women's health) in Baton Rouge and the Christus Health community sites. The new Gulf South M/U CTN has garnered the support of the Louisiana Department of Health Secretary and the Governor, who are developing a cancer care plan for the state (Taking Aim at Cancer in Louisiana Collaborative -TACL), where the Gulf South M/U CTN is the major provider of state-wide cancer clinical trials. This support will help us to continue increasing the participation of patients in NCORP and non-NCORP studies. To achieve our goals we will implement the following three strategies. 1. Expand the number of sites through additional partnerships with community organizations such as FQHC's where we will test novel approaches to increase the participation of community physicians providing care to cancer patients in the region; 2. Support the development of CCDR and Health Disparities research initiated by our investigators to understand the inequities created by cancer in our region and 3. Increase our participation in national trials supported by NCORP and other organizations to expand the scope and depth of trials offered to our patients.

"MaineHealth Cancer Care Network (MHCCN) and NCORP Activities across the Lifespan Abstract  Maine ranks 12th and 8th in adult cancer incidence and mortality respectively, and pediatric cancer incidence rates are the third highest in the nation, contributing to marked cancer health disparities in our state. In 2018, it is estimated there will be 8,600 new adult cancer cases diagnosed in Maine; cancer is the most common cause of death in our state. Of these adult cases, 6,185 (72%) will receive their care at a MaineHealth Cancer Care Network (MHCCN) hospital or outpatient facility. This patient volume is akin to any major metropolitan cancer center. With only 1.3 million residents, Maine is a small state, is the most rural state, and has the oldest population in the nation. There are significant cancer risk behaviors and exposures, and there are numerous socioeconomic and geographic challenges as well, further compounding our cancer burden. The MHCCN is clearly organized around patient, health provider, and healthcare system multi-tiered strategies and interventions that are prioritized in the NCORP solicitation and defended in this proposal. Our health system embarked upon a comprehensive oncology strategic planning process in 2014 that in a relatively short period has led to the opportunity to submit our response to this FOA. Consensus was reached on the model of cancer care that we would pursue. The singular goal is to ensure that ""the right care, in the right location, as close to home as possible"" will be provided. Cancer patients in our state and their families desire access to state-of-the-art patient-centered care. This NCORP application could not come at a more auspicious time for our organization, coinciding with significant growth and substantive multi- million dollar investment in MH Oncology over the past couple years. With this backdrop, the fundamental goal of our application is to commit and contribute to a robust slate of NCORP activities across the lifespan including pediatric, adolescent and young adults, adults, and elderly cancer patients in our communities and rural care settings. We have assembled a highly interactive and interdisciplinary team across our network to participate in and lead this research endeavor. Our central hypothesis is that developing a highly interactive and interdisciplinary approach to cancer care that is at all times patient-centered throughout MH Oncology will have salutary effects on all aspects of our cancer care across the continuum of prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, end-of-life, and care delivery not only for our patients and their families but for other aspects critical to our mission – including educating the next generation of healthcare providers and expanding our research pursuits especially in rural areas within our care network. We propose 4 aims: To conduct and actively participate in 1) cancer control research, 2) cancer prevention research, and 3) cancer care delivery research studies; and 4) to capitalize upon clinical research opportunities afforded by NCORP and our newly awarded Northern New England Clinical and Translational Research Network grant (1U54 GM115517). We will pursue these aims across the lifespan engaging both children and adults. The MHCNN has every expectation that will we make substantive contributions across the spectrum of the NCORP research portfolio. We will capitalize on our institutional assets, patient resources, and expertise from the vantage point of community and rural settings to add value across the lifespan and provide leadership to the NCORP. We welcome and value the opportunity to join the NCORP network as a new institutional member. Public Health Relevance  The State of Maine faces challenging cancer heath disparities, as it is the most rural and oldest state in the nation. Historically, cancer patients and their families in Maine have had inconsistent access to state-of-the-art federally-sponsored cancer research trials.

"Addressing Cancer-Related Financial Toxicity In Rural Oncology Care Settings PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT Financial toxicity (FT), a term used to describe the high cost and cost-related psychosocial burden that cancer care places on patients and their families, is a major and underappreciated problem affecting at least 20% of all cancer patients, with potentially devastating effects on outcomes. FT disproportionately affects patients in rural settings due to multiple socioeconomic, access, and clinical factors. A recent review of cancer-related financial hardship characterized the burden of FT as belonging to one of three domains: (1) material hardship, including high out-of-pocket expenses and lost wages; (2) psychological burden from distress and anxiety caused by high cancer costs; and (3) behavioral changes resulting from high cancer care costs, including changes in both medical and non-medical spending. Across cancer sites and stages, the considerable material hardship caused by cancer has been linked consistently to negative psychological and behavioral outcomes, including lower health-related quality of life, higher emotional distress, treatment delay/discontinuation, and filing for bankruptcy. Importantly, FT is also associated with increased mortality. Harmful psychological effects and care-altering behavioral responses, such as delaying or foregoing treatment, are more common in rural patients who also face considerable geographic barriers to care and greater financial vulnerability (e.g., lack of health insurance), likely contributing to widely-observed rural/urban disparities in cancer mortality. Interventions are urgently needed to prevent and mitigate high FT for cancer patients living in rural areas. Our prior work with patients, cancer care professionals, and a regional network of rural oncology practices argues strongly for intervening with financial navigation (FN), due to the complex material, structural, and psychological needs in this setting, fragmentation of existing financial support resources, and complicated assistance eligibility requirements. FN is one type of evidence-based intervention implemented at the practice or system level that can identify patients at high risk for FT, assess eligibility for existing federal, nonprofit, manufacturer, and local financial support resources, clarify treatment cost expectations, and develop strategies to cope with high costs of care. Our long-term goal is to improve cancer care delivery, reduce FT, and improve outcomes in underserved, rural populations through sustainable, scalable interventions. The objectives of this application are to: (1) understand the rural oncology practice context to optimize tailored strategies to support FN implementation; (2) assess FN intervention implementation in rural oncology practices; and (3) evaluate the effects of FN implementation on patient outcomes, including FT and health-related quality of life, in rural oncology practices. Our proposal is directly responsive to RFA-CA-18-026, which seeks to “improve the reach and quality of cancer care in rural populations”. Expected outcomes are the development and refinement of the operational and logistical processes needed to deliver effective FN in rural settings and reduction in FT, with potential to reduce rural outcome disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The financial toxicity (FT) of cancer care is a serious and growing problem, particularly for rural patients, who face disproportionate hardship due to multiple socioeconomic, access, and clinical factors; as a result, interventions are urgently needed to address FT among rural patients, who experience higher cancer-related morbidity and mortality than their non-rural counterparts, due, in part, to financially-motivated, care-altering behaviors, such as delaying or skipping life-prolonging treatments. The sustainability of interventions such as evidence-based financial navigation (FN) to prevent and mitigate FT in rural settings requires an understanding of: (1) the rural oncology practice context to guide the tailoring of strategies to support FN implementation, (2) the process of implementation in rural oncology practices, and (3) whether FN implementation in rural settings leads to improvement in FT and other patient-reported outcomes, such as health-related quality of life. The objective of this application, therefore, is to systematically assess the implementation and effectiveness of a FN intervention delivered in 5 rural oncology practices to 500 patients, with a goal of reducing FT and improving care quality, access, and outcomes in rural cancer patients.",Addressing Cancer-Related Financial Toxicity In Rural Oncology Care Settings,9788857,R01CA240092,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Coping Behavior ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' financial assistance ', ' Financial Support ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' Salaries ', ' Wages ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' Shock ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Work ', ' Financial Insolvency ', ' Bankruptcy ', ' Rural Community ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Caring ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' total medical expenditure ', ' medical expenses not covered by insurance ', ' Uncovered Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' Uncovered Medical Expenses ', ' Out-of-Pocket Expense ', ' Rural ', ' Logistics ', ' satisfaction ', ' uptake ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' emotional distress ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' cancer site ', ' cancer location ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer care ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', "" President's Cancer Panel "", ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' prescription drug costs ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' implementation research ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' arm ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' improved outcome ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' urban disparity ', ' rural patients ', ' rural setting ', ' rural place ', ' rural locality ', ' recruit ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' care costs ', ' barrier to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' implementation strategy ', ' rural cancer care ', ' financial toxicity ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial stress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial distress ', ' financial burden ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,491967,0.07945702553699077

"MINORITY-BASED COMMUNITY ONCOLOGY PROGRAM The overall goals of the Montefiore-Einstein minority-based NCORP community site are to advance the diagnosis, prevention, and management of early and advanced cancer by participating in NCORP trials as a minority/underserved community site, and contributing scientifically and administratively to the NCORP research bases. This will be accomplished by leveraging the strengths of the Montefiore Health System (MHS), including Montefiore Medical Center (MMC), which brings strengths in integrated patient care and innovative health care delivery systems in an academic medical center serving a largely minority population, and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Cancer Center (Einstein), which brings strength in training and education, and in baslc, translational, and clinical research through its NCI- designated cancer center. The MMC-Einstein program also brings critical leadership to the NCORP Research Bases, including ECOG-ACRIN, Alliance, and NRG, including leadership roles at the level of the group chair's office, scientific committee chair (or co-chair), and protocol chair (or co-chair). Our plans build upon our long-standing involvement in all aspects of cancer research as a main member of ECOG for 45 years and an NCI-designated cancer center for 48 years, and a strong history of minority accrual to cancer treatment trials (about 65%of all patients). MMC serves the Bronx, an urban community of 1.47 million residents, of whom 89% are minorities and 29% live below the federal poverty level. In the prior funding period we had a strong track record scientific contributions to the NCORP research bases, and met our accrual targets with exceptionally strong minority participation. In the next funding period, we will continue our strong leadership in cancer therapeutics (EA2165), expand the spectrum of our activities to include new programs in cancer imaging and screening (TMIST), cancer control/prevention (EAZ171), and cancer care delivery research (CCDR). The MMC-Einstein NCORP program is led by faculty with experience in cancer therapeutics and biomarker research (J. Sparano, MD), precision medicine and immunoncology (B. Halmos, MD), and CCDR and cancer prevention/control (B. Rapkin, PhD), and is supported by a cadre of other investigators with a broad range of expertise, some of whom benefited from NCI- funded K12 training program in clinical cancer research. The goal of the Montefiore-Einstein Minority/Underserved National Community Oncology Research Program (MU NCORP) is to advance the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management of early and advanced cancer. Our goals are to: 1) accrue at least 80 subjects to trials sponsored by the NCORP research bases (including at least 40 to therapeutic trials), 2) provide scientific and administrative leadership to the ECOG-ACRIN, NRG and Alliance research bases; 3) expand our capacity for cancer care delivery research (CCDR) to include at least 3 active CCDR protocols; 4) train and mentor young investigators in all areas of NCORP research; and 5) contribute expertise in novel methodology to address cancer health disparities, including patient engagement, trial design and outcomes measurement.",MINORITY-BASED COMMUNITY ONCOLOGY PROGRAM,9771628,UG1CA189859,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Black race ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Language ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' New York ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Training Programs ', ' Training Support ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' taxane ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Anal carcinoma ', ' Anus Carcinoma ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Hematopoietic Neoplasms ', ' blood cancer ', ' Malignant Hematopoietic Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasms ', ' Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Cell Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic Tumor ', ' Hematopoietic Neoplasms including Lymphomas ', ' Hematopoietic Malignancies ', ' Hematopoietic Cell Tumor ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Neuropathy ', ' neuropathic ', ' System ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Medical center ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' postgraduate education ', ' post-graduate education ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Committee Members ', ' Institution ', ' SECTM1 gene ', ' Secreted and Transmembrane 1 ', ' SECTM1 ', ' K12 ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adjuvant Study ', ' adjuvant protocol ', ' Adjuvant Trials ', ' Albert Einstein Cancer Center ', ' AECC ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ', ' ECOG ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' American College of Radiology Imaging Network ', ' ACRIN ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Adjuvant ', ' treatment trial ', ' health related quality of life ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' federal poverty level ', ' minority subjects ', ' population based ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' oncology program ', ' screening ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Therapeutic Trials ', ' trial design ', ' Minority Participation ', ' institutional capacity ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' underserved minority ', ' patient engagement ', ' biomarker validation ', ' marker validation ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Nivolumab ', ' Opdivo ', ' financial toxicity ', ' ']",NCI,"MONTEFIORE MEDICAL CENTER (BRONX, NY)",UG1,2019,1146084,0.0037436940613637796

"NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Minority/Underserved Community Sites PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overarching goal of the New Mexico MU-NCORP is to improve the quality of cancer care throughout our catchment area (the State of New Mexico) and to eliminate the tremendous burden of cancer health disparities in the multiethnic populations that we serve by building innovative statewide outreach programs, founded in community-based participatory research methods and scientific collaborations between community health systems and providers with the primary academic affiliate site, resulting in an increased awareness, acceptance, access, and participation by all New Mexicans in NCI-sponsored cancer screening, post-treatment surveillance, prevention, and therapeutic clinical trials. The University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer (UNMCCC) serves as the primary affiliate with strong scientific programs in cancer population sciences, cancer control, health disparities, and clinical interventions, in partnership with nearly all New Mexico health systems and community cancer care sites that are consortium members of the New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance (NMCCA, secondary affiliate), a joint 501c3 statewide clinical trials research network that provides the major clinical trials infrastructure to support the goals of the NCI NCORP. This NM MU-NCORP organization continues to engage all stakeholders in our cancer health mission and builds upon a well-established 20 year partnership supported in part by prior NCI MB-CCOP and current NCORP grants. This consortium has a proven track record and success in enrolling New Mexico's highly diverse multiethnic, rural, and underserved cancer patients in NCTN trials and has launched several cancer care delivery (CCDR) trials that are of great interest to our community partners. The NM MU-NCORP will continue to be actively engaged in developing research strategies across the NCORP Research Bases and will serve as working partners throughout the NCORP Network. With the highest percentage of Hispanics and American Indians of any state, New Mexico's 2.1 million citizens are 39% non- Hispanic White, 47% Hispanic, 10% American Indian, 2.4% Black, and 1.6% Asian and other ethnic minorities. New Mexico ranks at the bottom (48th) in the U.S. in annual per capita income and a substantial number of New Mexicans, particularly its minority populations, are poor, rural, and underserved. With the nation's highest rate (30%) of childhood poverty, nearly 20% of all New Mexicans live in poverty and 10-13% of New Mexicans, depending on the county, still lack health insurance. Our research strategy is focused on academic/community team partnerships to address all aspects of cancer screening, prevention, cancer control, cancer care delivery, and therapeutic intervention in order to prioritize and optimize trial-based cancer care, while enhancing collaboration with the NCORP Research Bases in order to generate the next generation of trials to address the cancer disparities of the New Mexicans served by the MU-NCORP. Project Narrative The relevance of the New Mexico Minority-Underserved NCORP (MU-NCORP) lies in the deep rooted mission of our longstanding partnership of academic and community cancer providers and other community stakeholders managed through a unique statewide consortium infrastructure (UNM Comprehensive Cancer Center and the New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance) to deliver the highest quality in all aspects of cancer care (cancer screening, prevention control and cancer care delivery) to all New Mexicans with a strong focus on eradicating disparities in access, care delivery and outcomes. Our growth as an NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center with scientific programmatic focus on innovative approaches to cancer delivery and disparities research in our unique New Mexican populations in conjunction with our longstanding community partnerships through nearly 20 years of work as an MB-CCOP and now MU-NCOORP continues to support our progress in meaningful reduction in cancer burden and better understanding of barriers to care for our population. Continued team work with all academic, community oncology and tribal and other community stakeholders while serving as leaders within the NCI NCORP, CTEP and DCP with bidirectional research engagement will continue to strengthen our program and effectiveness in improving quality and length of life for New Mexicans and other minority populations.",NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP)

"The University of Kansas Cancer Center's- MCA Rural NCORP Abstract The overarching goal for The University of Kansas Cancer Center – Midwest Cancer Alliance Rural NCORP (KUCC-MCA Rural NCORP) is to enhance capacity for increasing clinical trials accrual and participation of rural populations in cancer control, prevention, treatment, and care delivery clinical trials, as well as in other human research developed and conducted by NCORP Research Bases. While cancer affects all population groups, certain subgroups, including those living in rural communities, are more at risk than others.[1, 2] Contributing risk factors include older age, inadequate insurance coverage, lower socio-economic status, minority race, and more isolated geography—all of which can be barriers to receiving specialty healthcare. Inaccessibility of clinical trials due to geographical barriers clearly disadvantages rural patients and is their most frequently cited reason for not enrolling in studies.[5] Patients living in suburban areas have the highest accrual rates to clinical trials, while those by patients living in rural areas is quite low[6, 7]. The University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC) is strongly positioned to enhance clinical trial accrual and participation of rural populations through its leadership of the Midwest Cancer Alliance (MCA) and its cadre of accomplished investigators with extensive experience working with rural communities and practices. As the outreach network of the KUCC, the MCA has partnered with hospitals, cancer centers, and health care providers across the state of Kansas for over a decade. The goal of these MCA partnerships has always been to extend the reach of clinical research into under-represented communities, with a focus on rural and low-income communities. MCA recently expanded to include our state-wide rural primary care practice based research network, Kansas Patients and Providers Engaged in Prevention Research (KPPEPR), a network of over 75 primary care providers from across Kansas with a longstanding history of supporting cancer prevention and control research initiatives. KUCC-MCA Rural NCORP will leverage our over 45-year experience as a SWOG-member, 20-year experience providing oncology care via telemedicine, 15-year history of successfully conducting research in rural primary care settings, and 10-year experience opening and running clinical trials within rural health care networks—all supported by KUCC expertise in partnering with rural oncology and primary care practices to accomplish our goals. Specifically for the KUCC-MCA Rural NCORP, we will assess institutional, provider, clinical trial, and patient barriers to trial accrual, and implement processes to: 1) Enhance the infrastructure of local cancer centers and primary care offices to support clinical trials accrual in rural communities; 2) Expand access to clinical trials across the MCA network by offering available NCORP clinical trials in local rural communities; 3) Decrease barriers to clinical trial participation for rural and low-income patients across Kansas and western Missouri by providing trial participation opportunities in their home communities; and 4) Leverage KUCC/MCA expertise for addressing rural cancer disparities to clinical trial participation with NCORP grantees.

"Delaware Christiana Care NCORP Project Summary/Abstract Delaware/Christiana Care (CCHS) National Cancer Institute Oncology Research Program (NCORP) was originally funded as a Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) in 1987, was funded as a NCI Community Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP) beginning in 2007 and continued participation as an NCORP in 2014 through the present. CCHS has been an exemplary contributor to all programs, frequently recognized for high accruals,stellar data quality and timeliness of submissions. Currently, CCHS participates in the ALLIANCE, ECOG- ACRIN, NRG, Wake Forest and Rochester cooperative groups with approximately 80 trials opened to accrual. Participation in CTSU and the CIRB is active and ongoing. Our catchment area includes all of Delaware and portions of New Jersey, northeastern Maryland and southeastern Pennsylvania. Our NCORP includes two affiliates, Beebe Health Care and Nanticoke Memorial, both located in southern Delaware. Our communities represents a popluation base in excess of 2 million people with extensive protocol entry potential. Under the leadership of Gregory Masters, M.D, Principal Investigator and Kandie Dempsey, DBA, MS, RN, OCN, Director, NCORP investigators and support professionals will continue to participate in NCTN core committees and leadership positions. Currently, our physician researchers are represented with appointments to 17 NCORP committees and 3 NCI Steering Committees (Breast, Gynecological and Imaging). Our mission is to continue accruals to both treatment and cancer control studies and to further develop Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) participation which will build upon the intiatives set forth with our collaboration the NCI. Every patient at the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute (HFGCCRI) is evaluated for clinical trial participation. We anticipate dedicating at minimum 10% of our activities towards CCDR to include scientific investigation of the complexities of social factors, organizational structures and processes, health technologies, access to cancer care, quality and cost factors, disparties in our community. And will examine the feasibility of examining financial costs of care and health technology systems as part of the CCDR program. The overall impact of this grant will be to ensure continuation and stimulate expansion of NCORP activities, including treatment and cancer control research, at CCHS and its affiliates. The Delaware/CCHS NCORP has consistently rated amongst top in the nation for clinical trial accruals. Over the past three years the accrual rate has been 21.1% in 2015, 26.3% in 2016 and 27.4% in 2017.

"Enhancing Cancer Care Of Rural Dwellers Through Telehealth and Engagement (ENCORE) The proposed project is submitted in response to RFA-CA-18-026, providing an “IT-enabled, team-based care delivery models … to deliver comprehensive, coordinated, high-quality cancer-related care to rural low-income and/or underserved populations.” There are widening mortality disparities among rural cancer patients, particularly those who live in counties with persistent poverty, making it critical to develop interventions to improve outcomes for these patients. Therefore, the proposed study is based at seven rural hospitals in Tennessee and Mississippi, states with large rural populations encompassing a third and a half of the population, respectively. With barriers at the health system, provider and patient level, multi-level remotely-delivered interventions that enable rural patients and providers to access expertise housed at a comprehensive cancer center hold tremendous promise. Through the proposed study, we will employ a Type 1 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation design, which includes a traditional clinical effectiveness trial along with a process evaluation of the intervention delivery and implementation. Specifically, we will evaluate the 1) clinical effectiveness of a multi-level telehealthbased intervention for rural hospitals consisting of provider-level access to a molecular tumor board and patientlevel access to supportive care; and 2) facilitators and barriers to future larger scale dissemination and implementation of this multilevel intervention, designed to enhance quality of rural cancer care delivery. The intervention consists of non-randomized provider-level access to a tumor board which incorporates disease, patient and molecular tumor characteristics to enhance treatment options, together with randomized patient-level access to a self-management intervention versus attention control. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research will be used to identify barriers and facilitators. These efforts are possible due to existing community partnerships already in place, which will be leveraged to bring comprehensive care available at our cancer center to rural cancer patients and providers through telehealth. To further underscore the importance of our efforts, the Southern United States in which our academic cancer center is based has amongst the highest cancer mortality rates, and is the region of focus for this application. Our short-term goals are to explore means by which to enhance cancer care among rural cancer patients through broadly and remotely sharing expertise available at our cancer center with rural underserved communities in our region. Our long-term goals are to disseminate evidence-based strategies to improve outcomes among rural cancer patients. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT The goal of this proposal is to improve delivery of comprehensive cancer care delivery to rural communities with persistent poverty, where cancer incidence and mortality are high. Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we will test a multi-level telehealth-based intervention that offers oncologists access to a Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center-based molecular tumor board to expand treatment options, and offers their patients a supportive care intervention to help manage cancer therapy. This type of study is needed to develop evidence-based strategies to remotely make comprehensive cancer care available to rural patients residing in counties with persistent poverty to ultimately reduce the disparities in outcomes.",Enhancing Cancer Care Of Rural Dwellers Through Telehealth and Engagement (ENCORE),9788880,R01CA240093,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers

"NCI, National Clinical Trials Network Lead Academic Participating Site (LAPS) UG1 PROJECT SUMMARY As reflected in this application, Mayo Clinic has a long tradition of clinical research and has been a supporter and active participant in the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). Support of the NCTN includes formation of one of the founding organizations (North Central Cancer Treatment Group, now Alliance), Sustained leadership roles in the NCTN and in clinical trials, as well as active supporters of clinical trials. Multiple Mayo Clinic staff continue in current leadership roles within the NCTN or NCI sponsored activities related to the NCTN. Mayo Clinic remains committed to making NCTN trials a prominent part of its portfolio of clinical trials for cancer patients or patients at-risk for cancer. This commitment is reflected in the prioritization of NCTN trials over many other trials, the level of accrual to NCTN trials, further refinements to the activation and monitoring of progress of NCTN trials to ensure their success, the continued leadership role of Mayo Clinic physicians in the NCTN member organizations, and an on-going commitment of the MCCC to support this activity. Mayo Clinic physicians and researchers continue to have an active role in not only patient accrual to NCTN clinical trials, but to leadership in developing and leading trials. Mayo Clinic researchers also continue to be active in presenting the results of these trials at national and international meetings and high-impact journals, as described within the current grant application. Mayo Clinic researchers have continued to be active in performing subsequent analyses of the collected data, and meaningful use of the biospecimens collected from the trials to transform the science of cancer care. Mayo Clinic has also continued to focus on the development of junior investigators in the NCTN to ensure the continued active support of NCTN member organizations and the success of NCTN clinical research. Finally, Mayo Clinic is committed to making clinical trials available to all patients, regardless of their racial, ethnicity, or socioeconomic background. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mayo Clinic has a long tradition of clinical research and has been a supporter and active participant in the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). With over 1.3 million unique patients seen each year (of which over 120,000 are patients with cancer), Mayo Clinic is committed to making clinical trials available to all patients regardless of their racial, ethnicity, or socioeconomic background. A major factor in allowing this to occur is through Mayo Clinic's commitment to making NCTN trials a prominent part of its portfolio of clinical trials for cancer patients or patients at-risk for cancer.","NCI, National Clinical Trials Network Lead Academic Participating Site (LAPS) UG1",9619261,UG1CA232760,"['Arizona ', ' Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Florida ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Grant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Rural Population ', ' Universities ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Site ', ' Ensure ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' named group ', ' Special Population ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' cancer care ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ', ' ECOG ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Gynecologic Oncology Group ', ' GOG ', ' International ', ' Mayo Clinic Cancer Center ', ' National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project ', ' NSABP ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' American College of Radiology Imaging Network ', ' ACRIN ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Science ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' North Central Cancer Treatment Group ', ' NCCTG ', ' Monitor ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' National Clinical Trials Network ', ' NCI National Clinical Trials Network ', ' Minority Enrollment ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' recruit ', ' cognitive computing ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,UG1,2019,984029,0.05250629854028208
"Medical University of South Carolina NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site PROJECT SUMMARY The Medical University of South Carolina/Hollings Cancer Center (MUSC/HCC) was established as a Minority Underserved site in 2014 to expand and enhance the NCORP trial portfolio by accruing racially/ethnically diverse patients and those from other medically underserved groups into NCORP studies, share expertise and experience on minority recruitment and retention and cultural diversity within the NCORP community, and contribute to the development and implementation of cancer care and cancer delivery research.

"NRG Oncology NCORP Research Base The objective of this proposal is to establish and maintain the NCORP (National Community Oncology Research Program) for the NRG Oncology research base. The NRG NCORP is the result of aligning the legacy CCOPs (Community Clinical Oncology Programs) from three NCI Cancer Cooperative Groups: NSABP, RTOG and GOG. These groups together have over almost 100 years of combined experience serving as CCOP Research Bases. NRG NCORP, comprised of a multi-disciplinary team of investigators and patient advocates, is poised to carry out the objectives of: 1) designing and conducting cancer prevention, control and screening clinical trials; 2) designing and embedding patient reported outcomes in both primary NCOPR trials as well as NRG therapeutic trials 3) designing and conducting cancer care delivery research; 4) enhancing community access to treatment and imaging trials conducted under the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and 5) conducting primary intervention trials and integrating health disparity research questions into cancer care delivery research and treatment trials. To allow NRG NCORP to meet these goals, the group will: participate fully in NRG Oncology leadership and will determine the scientific direction and prioritization of the NRG NCORP activities and resources and oversee the translational research, clinical trial activities, and correlative studies related to the aims of NRG NCORP. With the NRG Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC), this team will provide efficient, methodologically up-to-date trial design with a focus on NCORP specific needs such as patient-reported repeated longitudinal assessments and cluster-randomized designs. NRG NCORP will provide study monitoring, reporting, and analysis; build an infrastructure to support our cancer care delivery research agenda; provide comprehensive data management quality control and quality assurance programs to ensure high data integrity and timely data for analysis; leverage cutting edge information technology emphasizing security, timeliness, and efficiency of data collection and management; providing RT credentialing and quality assurance; and provide education and training for institutional Clinical Research Associates, Study Chairs, local Principal Investigators and others involved in the NRG NCORP research agenda. Further, to accomplish these aims NRG NCORP will engage fully with NCI-designated NCORP community physicians and patient advocates as well as the NCI and other NCI-sponsored entities (cooperative groups, cancer centers, SPOREs) to collaborate across the NCTN to improve cancer prevention and control, cancer care and outcomes, and quality of life for patients affected by cancer. NRG Oncology NCORP research will significantly impact cancer prevention, screening, control and care delivery, and bring state-of-the-art treatment trials to community centers where most cancer treatments are delivered. NRG NCORP will conduct high impact studies for patients with many types of solid tumors with a particular unique focus in both women's health and cancer control issues related to radiation therapy.

"Nephrotic Syndrome Rare Disease Clinical Research Network III ABSTRACT Focal and Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), Minimal Change Disease (MCD) and Membranous Nephropathy (MN), presenting as Nephrotic Syndrome (NS), are rare diseases causing catastrophic complications and end stage kidney disease, generating enormous individual, societal and economic burdens. The clinical, histopathology-based taxonomy of NS is inadequate and fails to capture the molecular bases of these diseases and does not adequately predict their natural history or response to therapy. A Precision Medicine (PM) approach is necessary to define NS in molecular terms, to identify therapeutic targets and match patients to treatments. NEPTUNE was applied an innovative, investigational strategy to improve the diagnosis, management and treatment of NS. In the first two project periods, a translational and clinical research infrastructure has been established, participants enrolled, biosamples collected, key collaborations forged and an outreach strategy deployed. NEPTUNE has established a robust investigative infrastructure encompassing 26 academic centers and two patient interest groups, has recruited more than 750 rigorously phenotyped NS participants with detailed clinical, histological, genetic, transcriptomic and proteomic data sets. This comprehensive information has been integrated in the NEPTUNE Knowledge Network for easy access by the NS research community. With substantial support from the patient interest group NephCure Kidney International, NEPTUNE has established robust training and ancillary study programs with 112 ancillary studies ranging from methods development to successful Phase II clinical trials. These critical advances have resulted in a significant interest in NS clinical trials, with more than 15 trials now in the advanced planning or enrollment phase. In this renewal application, we propose to leverage the NEPTUNE resources to catalyze discovery, training and outreach as we strive to improve health outcomes for individuals affected by NS. The overarching goal is to apply a PM approach to NS, leveraging the extensive NEPTUNE Knowledge Network established over the past 9 years. NEPTUNE will implement this PM strategy to permit discovery of novel therapeutic targets and deploy the patient stratification approach developed in the current funding cycle to help identify the right trial for the right patient at the right time: Patient stratification approaches will be utilized for targeted enrollment into clinical trials. Patients will undergo intense profiling at the time of disease presentation or at follow-up renal biopsy in order to match the disease mechanism active with ongoing clinical trials in a precompetitive, public private partnership with leading companies in the field. Training, pilot and ancillary study programs will continue with significant funding support from NKI. NEPTUNE will maintain its engagement with lay communities, clinicians, scientists, regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical industry to identify and move therapeutic targets to our patients through an effective translational research pipeline for NS. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Nephrotic Syndrome Network (NEPTUNE) has established a rich translational and clinical research infrastructure for more than 750 rigorously phenotyped study participants with detailed clinical, histological, genetic, transcriptomic and proteomic data sets used by 112 approved ancillary studies to-date. In the next funding cycle, NEPTUNE will intensify the mechanistic disease definition in the biopsy and pediatric cohorts and will offer a precision medicine approach to 425 study participants, matching the disease mechanism active in the individual patients' kidneys to the targeted clinical trials pursued by our private partners with the goal to deliver the right therapy for the right patient at the right time.",Nephrotic Syndrome Rare Disease Clinical Research Network III,9804073,U54DK083912,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Africa South

"Cancer Center Support Grant P30 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC), a consortium with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), is a matrix organization under the aegis of the UC Davis Health System and University of California, Davis. Two hundred and four members are organized into six programs, supported by eight shared resources, and led by Senior Leadership in order to use transdisciplinary, translational, and transformative research to address the following problems: With a rapidly aging population, 40 million Americans over the age of 65 are alive today and 390,000 will die from cancer this year. In 15 years, approximately, 74 million Americans of this age will be alive and cancer mortality will be ~730,000/year. The present methods by which new cancer therapies have been developed have met with a disappointing failure rate; therefore, improved translational methods are needed. So too are integrated programs that combine physical sciences, biomedical technology, and functional imaging to develop new therapies and delivery modalities as well as methods for functional evaluation and enhanced detection to determine, in a non-toxic fashion, if therapies will work. Two main foci are used to address these problems:  1) Reducing disparities in the cancer burden  2) Tackling advanced cancer by adapting molecularly targeted therapy through our patient derived  xenograft program (PDX) and canine patients to truly develop personalized medicine. Each of these uses a multi-disciplinary approach, combining expertise from across programs (Molecular Oncology, Comparative Oncology, Cancer Therapeutics, Population Sciences and Health Disparities, Prostate Urothelial Cancer, and Biomedical Technology), leveraging the UC Davis expertise (e.g., School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Biological Sciences, Department of Biomedical Technology), and with external partners (the Jackson Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Foundation Medicine). Seven Innovation Groups enhance collaborative interactions and proposals with focus on translating basic and technological findings into grants and investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Beyond that, the UCDCCC’s robust clinical trials program enables these discoveries to be translated into patient benefits. The portfolio consist of NCI awards to fund Phase I, II, and III trials, COG and NCI Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium trials, and a strong portfolio of IITs. These are implemented by a cadre of clinical scientists (11 of whom were recruited in the past funding period) who function as the interface of translational and clinical research. The catchment area (13 counties surrounding Sacramento county) is benefited through, among other activities, a city-wide early phase clinical trials program and the UCDCCC Cancer Care Network, through which the resources and expertise of a comprehensive cancer center are brought to disadvantaged and rural areas while keeping patients in their home communities. Finally, in this world of ever-changing cancer care delivery models, combined with an increasing numbers of patients seeking help and increasing complexities of treatments available, we are building a robust cancer supportive/psycho oncology program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer and its effects are an ever-increasing problem at the population and individual levels. The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center's research is aimed at reducing this burden through cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment that is truly precision and personalized.

"Understanding the effects of the Oncology Care Model on cancer care for dual eligible patients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Lindsey Herrel, MD, MS is a urologic oncologist and junior health services researcher focused on improving cancer care for vulnerable populations through health policy reform. Dr. Herrel's long-term career goal is to become an independent surgeon-scientist evaluating healthcare policies that impact vulnerable populations with cancer, with the ability to translate research findings through healthcare policy reform. Research Context: Nearly 900,000 Medicare beneficiaries are diagnosed with cancer annually, with costs exceeding $34 billion. The Oncology Care Model, which is the first alternative payment model in cancer, incentivizes physicians to provide higher quality care at a lower cost. For dual eligible beneficiaries who qualify for Medicare due to elderly status and Medicaid due to low income, programs such as OCM that reward improvements in quality and reductions spending through care coordination, may offer a unique opportunity to improve cancer care for these vulnerable populations. However, this program may also lead to adverse selection and limited access if financial incentives are not properly aligned. Specific Aims: 1) To better understand practice level variation in OCM participation for dual eligible beneficiaries. 2) To examine the effect of OCM participation on quality of cancer care and spending for duals. 3) To evaluate the impact of alternative payment strategies on cancer care for dual eligible beneficiaries. Research Plan: Dr. Herrel will use Medicare claims and methodology consistent with current policy to characterize practices participating in OCM, in particular where duals are receiving cancer care. She will then use advanced econometric methods to evaluate the effect of the OCM policy on improving quality and reducing spending for duals. Finally, she will determine if current financial incentives are properly aligned with caring for duals and will assess if alternate payment strategies may provide greater motivation to care for duals. Career Development Plan: In parallel with this research plan and under the guidance of well- established mentors, Dr. Herrel will develop expertise in: 1) health equity for vulnerable populations and dual eligible beneficiaries; 2) legislative and regulatory aspects of health policy; 3) advanced econometric analyses for policy evaluation and simulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Oncology Care Model is the first alternative payment model in cancer care and is designed to improve quality of cancer care and reduce overall spending. Dual eligible beneficiaries, with their complex medical and social care needs, may significantly benefit from the increased care coordination and resources offered through this policy, or may have limited access to care if financial incentives are improperly aligned. The overarching goal of this proposal is to harness advanced quantitative methods for health policy evaluation to understand the impact of the Oncology Care Model on cancer care for dual eligible beneficiaries.",Understanding the effects of the Oncology Care Model on cancer care for dual eligible patients,9718615,K08CA237638,"['Accounting ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Fees ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Health Services ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospices ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Incentives ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Patient Care Episodes ', ' care episode ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' urologic ', ' urological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Fostering ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Oncologist ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Risk Adjustment ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' payment ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' cancer care ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Voluntary Programs ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' beneficiary ', ' cost ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' dual eligible ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' chemotherapy ', ' Medicare claim ', ' financial incentive ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' health equity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' improved outcome ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' care coordination ', ' coordinating care ', ' econometrics ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2019,256480,0.046454804901529756

"Metro-Minnesota Community Oncology Research Consortium (MMCORC) Project Summary The Metro-Minnesota Community Oncology Research Consortium (MMCORC), formerly known as the Metro- Minnesota Community Clinical Oncology Program (MMCCOP), has a long history of success, as demonstrated by the ongoing commitment of is original members and the consortium's growth from 1979 to 2018. Today, MMCORC is an established community program that began through its National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded Community Hospital Cancer Program Award. This program improved cancer care delivery in the community and was the cornerstone for the Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) initiative. It received the initial NCI CCOP grant in 1983 and has been awarded subsequent CCOP grants in 3- to 5-year increments until the 5-year NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) grant in 2014. In 2010, hospitals, clinics, and oncologists in the MN Community Group Outreach Program joined MMCCOP, resulting in a metro-wide community cancer research program in Minneapolis-St. Paul. In 2014, MMCCOP received funding under the new NCORP grant program. In 2016, MMCCOP was renamed MMCORC to represent the disbanding of the NCI CCOP grant program and show the broad scope of oncology research services available to the community, consistent with a consortium model. MMCORC represents 25 hospital and clinics with a common approach and established mechanisms for identifying, enrolling, and following participants on NCI- sponsored treatment, cancer prevention and control, symptom management, and care delivery research protocols. The state health market remains extremely competitive and is constantly changing due to mergers and healthcare reform initiatives. Despite this environment, MMCORC hospitals and staff continue to collaborate and support the added time and expense of offering clinical research trials to patients in the communities we serve. The consortium incorporates a substantial segment of the oncology community and has provided a basis for communication, partnership, and collaboration among practicing oncologists, their hospital administrators, and other health professionals for 35 years. Combined, the consortium members see, on average, more than 17,170 new analytic cancer patients per year. In the consortium, 165 MD investigators represent medical oncology, hematology, and radiation and surgical oncology, including thoracic surgery, gynecologic oncology, radiology, neuro-oncology, obstetrics and gynecology, palliative care, and primary care, with 57 mid-level clinicians (nurse practitioners and physician assistants) considered associate investigators. MMCORC intends to continue to offer the community the most recent advances in cancer prevention, treatment, symptom management, and care delivery through continued affiliations with NCORP research bases such as Alliance, ECOG-ACRIN, NRG Oncology, SWOG via CTSU, URCC, and CCCWFU. By implementing proactive strategies to improve access and encourage participation from underrepresented and underserved groups, MMCORC is well positioned to achieve the goals of the NCORP set forth by the NCI. Project Narrative Clinical trials are a vital part of the research process. Access to oncology clinical trials remains essential to address the many unmet needs in cancer prevention, control, screening, and treatment. The bulk of cancer care takes place in community settings, so allowing patients from community hospitals to participate in national clinical research allows access to a larger, more diverse patient population to promote increased patient outcomes and reduce disparities. With this funding opportunity, the Metro-Minnesota Community Oncology Research Consortium (MMCORC) will continue to provide people in our community access to the newest therapies available for cancer treatment, symptom management, and cancer prevention, along with the opportunity to participate in trials that examine how the cancer care delivery process influences clinical outcomes and patient

"Georgia CaRes Augusta University has been home to Georgia's only NCI Community Oncology Research Program Minority/Underserved Community Site (NCORP M/U Community Site) since 2014. In partnership with DeKalb Medical Center, Morehouse School of Medicine, University Blood and Cancer Center in Athens, Phoebe Putney Medical Center in Albany, Augusta Oncology Associates in Augusta, and St. Dominic-Jackson Memorial Hospital in Jackson, Mississippi, the Georgia CaRes NCORP M/U Site has enrolled 408 patients to NCI clinical trials, 47% of which are African American and other minorities. The main goals of this application are to sustain and grow our NCORP Community Site, focusing on improving patient outcomes and reducing health disparities in M/U populations throughout the State of Georgia and beyond. Georgia has some of the nation's worst cancer disparities. The cancer experience for African Americans in Georgia varies widely from that of Caucasians and is especially evident in the disproportionate and astounding mortality rates from several common cancers (e.g., colorectal and breast cancers). Our original program was aptly named Georgia CaRes (Georgia Cancer Research) and represents our shared commitment to cancer research, including studies in cancer control, cancer prevention, and cancer care delivery, as well as clinical trials from NCI's National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). The renewal of Georgia CaRes will allow us to continue to serve large regions of the state with high concentrations of minority and medically underserved populations. We will accomplish this through the following Specific Aims: 1) Georgia CaRes will facilitate participation and enrollment of patients and healthcare providers into cancer control, prevention, and cancer care delivery research (CCDR) studies developed by NCI's Research Bases and in human research trials of the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN); 2) Georgia CaRes will support and strengthen NCORP goals by improving the scope of our activities as an NCORP M/U Community Site; and 3) Georgia CaRes will increase collaboration across our NCORP M/U Community network and with the Research Bases. Renewal of Georgia CaRes will have a significant and far-reaching impact on the health of minority and underserved populations within the State of Georgia and beyond. The State of Georgia experiences significant cancer incidence and mortality disparities within its minority and underserved communities. Our Georgia CaRes NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Minority/Underserved Site addresses these disparities by focusing on providing clinical trials, cancer control and prevention trials, and cancer care delivery research to Georgia's minority and underserved communities (rural, inner city). Renewal of Georgia CaRes will greatly impact the public health (especially with respect to cancer) of minority and underserved communities within the State of Georgia and beyond.",Georgia CaRes,9774659,UG1CA189851,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Leadership ', ' Mississippi ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Names ', ' Patient Participation ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rural Population ', ' Universities ', ' Urban Population ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Ensure ', ' Discipline ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Rural ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Malignant Childhood Neoplasm ', ' pediatric malignancy ', ' pediatric cancer ', ' children with cancer ', ' childhood malignancy ', ' child with cancer ', ' cancer in children ', ' cancer in a child ', ' Malignant childhood cancer ', ' Malignant Pediatric Tumor ', ' Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Childhood Tumor ', ' Childhood Cancers ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' Committee Membership ', ' Hematopoietic Neoplasms ', ' blood cancer ', ' Malignant Hematopoietic Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasms ', ' Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Cell Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic Tumor ', ' Hematopoietic Neoplasms including Lymphomas ', ' Hematopoietic Malignancies ', ' Hematopoietic Cell Tumor ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' inner city ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' Documentation ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Collection ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' minority health ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' control trial ', ' Morehouse School of Medicine ', ' Morehouse School of Med ', ' Morehouse Sch of Medicine ', ' screening ', ' Prevention trial ', ' National Clinical Trials Network ', ' NCI National Clinical Trials Network ', ' underserved minority ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' imaging study ', ' ']",NCI,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,UG1,2019,1149677,0.11126694603007599
"Columbus NCORP RFA-CA-18-016 Since its founding in 1983, the Columbus CCOP, now known as the Columbus NCORP, has been dedicated to providing high quality cancer care options in Central and Southeast Ohio as well as advancing cancer research through cancer research trials. The Columbus NCORP has grown in that time to encompass 20 affiliates and sub-affiliates, with 100 doctors serving as investigators. The NCORP serves a wide variety of populations, from urban areas to rural Appalachia. Over the six years comprising the next grant period, the NCORP plans to continue to grow in that capacity, improving its ability to participate in, assist with the design of, and successfully implement a wide range of cancer research trials, including treatment, cancer control, screening/surveillance, side effect prevention/management, and cancer care delivery research studies. In all areas the NCORP has been successful and plans to continue to grow in its ability to investigate health disparities in its region and increase participation in cancer research by underserved communities including minority populations, rural communities and those in Appalachian areas. Cancer care delivery research has been and continues to be a key component of this goal, as is continuing to improve care practices throughout the consortium. Close collaboration between NCORP affiliate institutions, non-oncology specialists, primary care physicians and community organizations is key to this goal. The Columbus NCORP plans to continue to pursue the cutting edge of cancer research through targeted and genomic therapies, while simultaneously seeking out and implementing trials that are directly applicable to those cancers with the highest incidence rate in our region: breast, colon and lung cancers. Over the past five years as an NCORP, and over the preceding 30 years as the Columbus CCOP, these areas have been a high priority and will continue to be as we aggressively pursue treatments that will advance the science of cancer care and best serve our local communities. The unique challenges facing Central and Southeast Ohio in these areas position the Columbus NCORP to make real and lasting contributions to cancer research, and the lessons learned here are widely applicable to regions across the country. The Columbus Community Clinical Oncology Program has been serving Central Ohio for 35 years and has been participating in the NCI Community Oncology Research Program since its inception. During that time, the Columbus CCOP has excelled in delivering cancer care and access to clinical studies to a wide variety of populations – from major urban areas to rural Appalachia.

"The Pacific Cancer Research Consortium (PCRC), an NCORP Community Site PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In 2013, the Pacific Cancer Research Consortium (PCRC) was created to bring clinical trials and cancer care delivery research to community cancer treatment centers in the Western United States as an NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Community Site. Under a multiple PI/PD structure, the 3 primary component sites—Swedish Cancer Institute in Seattle, Providence Portland Medical Center in Portland, and Mountain States Tumor Institute in Boise—have facilitated the conduct of NCORP-sponsored trials at more than 40 affiliate sites in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and California. Over the past 5 years, the PCRC built on its collective experience in clinical research, its shared organizational structure, and its diverse community demographics to achieve the research and accrual goals of the initial round of funding. As an established NCORP Community Site, for the next round of funding, the PCRC will continue to “bring cancer clinical research studies to individuals in their own communities” by (1) developing clinically important trials and achieving robust accruals that focus on underrepresented populations, (2) participating in cancer treatment, cancer control and prevention, cancer care delivery research, screening, and imaging trials proposed by the NCORP Research Bases, (3) optimizing and streamlining procedures to ensure timely and accurate data submission and specimen collection, (4) enhancing the participation of minorities and underserved populations by involving patient advocates, and (5) mentoring the next generation of community-based cancer clinical trialists. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The NCORP Community Site outlined in this continuation application comes from our experience building a multicenter infrastructure in the Western United States that excels in patient accrual and fosters new and close collaboration between investigators. We believe that our structure will accelerate the translation of knowledge gained from trials in cancer treatment, cancer control and prevention, cancer care delivery research, screening, and imaging into clinical practice and thereby enhance the science, the treatments, and the delivery of care to patients with cancer in community settings.","The Pacific Cancer Research Consortium (PCRC), an NCORP Community Site",9771761,UG1CA189953,"['Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Alaska ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Credentialing ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Idaho ', ' Institutes ', ' Mentors ', ' Montana ', ' Oregon ', ' Patients ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' Agreement ', ' research study ', ' organizational structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' Prevention ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Improve Access ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Collection ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Process ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' treatment center ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' next generation ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' demographics ', ' tumor ', ' knowledge translation ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' screening ', ' trial design ', ' Minority Participation ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' feasibility trial ', ' data submission ', ' data deposition ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,"SWEDISH MEDICAL CENTER, FIRST HILL",UG1,2019,2253975,0.07844303193250561
"New Mexico Clinical Trials Node: Clinical research and practice to address substance use in diverse, rural and underserved populations ABSTRACT NM is an epicenter of the opioid crisis in the US, with one of the highest overdose mortality rates since 1990. Both heroin-attributable opioid deaths and deaths from prescription opioids have increased, especially in Hispanic and American Indian/Alaska Native groups. Many challenging social determinants, including poverty and unemployment contribute to high rates of OUD in NM. Our group is ideally suited to lead a NIDA CTN Node because of the breadth and depth of our involvement in OUD research, extensive clinical trials experience, intimate connection with the ECHO Institute and its use for expanding access to SUD treatments, links with AI/AN researchers and clinicians, our proven ability to recruit diverse rural populations to participate in research, as well as informatics and data science capacity. The Aims of the NM Node are to: 1) develop and maintain a highly efficient platform to conduct clinical trials that will inform evidence-based prevention and treatment of OUD; 2) collaborate on and lead research that addresses and improves outcomes across the OUD Cascade of Care (CoC); 3) promote uptake of best-practices in OUD prevention and care in NM and nationwide through effective dissemination of evidence-based innovations. The expected impacts will be expanded research in diverse, rural and underserved populations impacted by the opioid crisis, and increased capacity of providers and researchers to collaborate on, lead, and propose impactful research. NM Node research will ensure the development of robust and generalizable methods for prevention, identification, and treatment of OUD including evaluation and modification of the CoC expanding the local and national knowledge base. Our dissemination aim will ensure a productive cycle of engagement and translation of evidence-based practices and promote a sustained positive impact on the OUD CoC in communities in NM and nationwide. Our proposal builds on multiple assets: 1) a strong alliance with the primary care health providers in (i) an existing PBRN (RIOS Net) that extends into rural NM, (ii) UNM community-based primary care clinics; (iii) and providers of SUD/ and OUD treatment at multiple rural and urban sites across NM including over 400 that have engaged with ECHO learning networks; 2) 15 years of prior CTN and protocol management experience; 3) expertise conducting research including clinical trials with patients with SUD and OUD; 4) leadership in health services including Project ECHO, informatics, and implementation research; 5) access to unique and diverse communities and patient populations, including medically underserved, rural, Hispanic and American Indian; 6) strong clinical and educational expertise in MOUD and 7) our strength in behavioral interventions for SUD, centered in CASAA . PROJECT NARRATIVE The New Mexico Node will leverage the strong research alliance that has been forged between University of New Mexico researchers and providers of clinical care across the state, working in primary care, behavioral health, maternal/child health, adolescent, public health, and criminal justice settings. By extending the reach of the NIDA CTN to the “majority minority” population of NM, we will play an integral role in establishing best practices for treatment of OUD/SUDs in uniquely diverse, rural populations. Our team’s extensive SUD/OUD expertise in implementation of clinical trials, behavioral health interventions informatics, workforce development, education/knowledge dissemination, and harm reduction will allow us to make an outsized contribution to improvement of public health via prevention and treatment of OUD.","New Mexico Clinical Trials Node: Clinical research and practice to address substance use in diverse, rural and underserved populations",9839338,UG1DA049468,"['American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Heroin ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Tetraethylthiuram Disulfide ', ' Antabuse ', ' Disulfiram ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Epidemic ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Services ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Cancer Center Support Grant P30 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC), a consortium with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), is a matrix organization under the aegis of the UC Davis Health System and University of California, Davis. Two hundred and four members are organized into six programs, supported by eight shared resources, and led by Senior Leadership in order to use transdisciplinary, translational, and transformative research to address the following problems: With a rapidly aging population, 40 million Americans over the age of 65 are alive today and 390,000 will die from cancer this year. In 15 years, approximately, 74 million Americans of this age will be alive and cancer mortality will be ~730,000/year. The present methods by which new cancer therapies have been developed have met with a disappointing failure rate; therefore, improved translational methods are needed. So too are integrated programs that combine physical sciences, biomedical technology, and functional imaging to develop new therapies and delivery modalities as well as methods for functional evaluation and enhanced detection to determine, in a non-toxic fashion, if therapies will work. Two main foci are used to address these problems:  1) Reducing disparities in the cancer burden  2) Tackling advanced cancer by adapting molecularly targeted therapy through our patient derived  xenograft program (PDX) and canine patients to truly develop personalized medicine. Each of these uses a multi-disciplinary approach, combining expertise from across programs (Molecular Oncology, Comparative Oncology, Cancer Therapeutics, Population Sciences and Health Disparities, Prostate Urothelial Cancer, and Biomedical Technology), leveraging the UC Davis expertise (e.g., School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Biological Sciences, Department of Biomedical Technology), and with external partners (the Jackson Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Foundation Medicine). Seven Innovation Groups enhance collaborative interactions and proposals with focus on translating basic and technological findings into grants and investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Beyond that, the UCDCCC’s robust clinical trials program enables these discoveries to be translated into patient benefits. The portfolio consist of NCI awards to fund Phase I, II, and III trials, COG and NCI Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium trials, and a strong portfolio of IITs. These are implemented by a cadre of clinical scientists (11 of whom were recruited in the past funding period) who function as the interface of translational and clinical research. The catchment area (13 counties surrounding Sacramento county) is benefited through, among other activities, a city-wide early phase clinical trials program and the UCDCCC Cancer Care Network, through which the resources and expertise of a comprehensive cancer center are brought to disadvantaged and rural areas while keeping patients in their home communities. Finally, in this world of ever-changing cancer care delivery models, combined with an increasing numbers of patients seeking help and increasing complexities of treatments available, we are building a robust cancer supportive/psycho oncology program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer and its effects are an ever-increasing problem at the population and individual levels. The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center's research is aimed at reducing this burden through cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment that is truly precision and personalized. Unique research strategies include the use of patient-derived xenografts, canine clinical trials, and state-of-the-art imaging, all of which is focused on translating discoveries into innovative clinical trials that ultimately improve the lives of patients and families with cancer.",Cancer Center Support Grant P30,9996868,P30CA093373,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' domestic dog ', ' canine ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' Dogs ', ' Canine Species ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Patients ', ' physical science ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Veterinary Schools ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Talents ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Veterinary Medicine ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Generations ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' Transcend ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' molecular oncology ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' member ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Modality ', ' Biomedical Technology ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Genomic Stability ', ' Genome Stability ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Detection ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' CCSG ', ' Cancer Grant Supplements (P30) ', ' P30 Grant ', ' P30 Award ', ' Cancer Grant Supplements ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Molecular ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Oncogenic ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' comparative ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' population health ', ' oncology program ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' improved outcome ', ' molecular targeted therapies ', ' molecular targeted treatment ', ' molecular targeted therapeutics ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' recruit ', ' Service delivery model ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' health care delivery model ', ' care delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' oncology trial ', ' investigator-initiated trial ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P30,2019,200000,0.015294446579397119

Prevention trials embrace the NCI's broad definition of prevention to include primary prevention, cancer screening, and secondary prevention and aim to identify high risk groups for precision prevention strategies. Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) examines the complex interactions between patient, provider, and system factors that influence care, and adapts and evaluates interventions in heterogenous community oncology practices. Health equity research permeates EA science through embedding disparities-related research questions that span EA activities, adopting a broad view of underserved populations including adolescents and young adults, the elderly, racial and ethnic minorities, sexual and gender minorities and rural residents. Key collaborations with community-based oncology programs will ensure access to EA NCTN and NCORP trials in communities where patients receive their care. EA provides access to existing NCI-funded resources and a network of >10000 physicians, scientists, nurses, research associates (RAs), statisticians, biomedical information technologists, and patient advocates across approximately 600 institutions and organizations. EA has provided scientific leadership in the NCORP community through advancing rigorous, practice-changing clinical trials and translational research in cancer control, prevention and care delivery and is well poised to continue to support the NCI's mission to engage community-based diverse populations in cancer research. Project Narrative The primary goals of the ECOG-ACRIN NCORP Research Base are: 1) to advance our understanding of approaches to prevent cancer and cancer-related physical and psychological symptoms, and 2) to develop and evaluate strategies to translate advances in high quality cancer care delivery into community oncology settings, with the aim of reducing the burden of cancer.",ECOG-ACRIN NCORP

"The Hawaii Minority/Underserved NCORP The overall goal of the Hawaiʻi Minority/Underserved NCORP is to provide access and facilitate enrollment of Hawaii’s diverse, multiethnic population to NCI sponsored trials. Thus we will enhance accrual of underrepresented populations including Native Hawaiians, other Pacific Islanders, Asian-Americans (Chinese, Japanese, Filipino and Korean), adolescents and young adults (AYA), the elderly and sexual and gender minorities (LGBTQ). Our NCORP is the primary provider of NCI clinical trials and cancer care delivery research (CCDR) in the State of Hawaiʻi where nearly 75% of the population is comprised of multiple minority racial/ethnic groups. The Hawaiʻi M/U NCORP supports an integrated network of affiliates and sub-affiliates with the extensive menu of cancer studies, research infrastructure and data management. Our NCORP has successfully extended CCDR studies from the originally designated sites to other hospital affiliate sites with plans to further extend them to physician office sites. We solicit community input from Native Hawaiian and LGBTQ advocates to review the suitability of trials as well as to address their healthcare needs. Non medical oncology community investigators and staff have leadership responsibility in imaging, prevention and CCDR studies. Our NCORP leaders have extensive experience in cancer clinical trials, health care delivery and disparities. They have served on multiple NCI committees. Participation in NCI’s personalized medicine, cancer control, prevention, treatment and CCDR research will further reduce cancer health care disparities and the cancer burden for the people of Hawaiʻi and beyond. The Hawaiʻi Minority/Underserved NCORP aims to: 1) conduct cancer clinical trials and cancer care delivery research, 2) continue contributing to NCORP research bases and NCI priorities, and 3) enhance participation of Hawaii‘s diverse multiethnic and at risk population in NCI sponsored trials in order to reduce health care disparities and the burden of cancer for the people of Hawai‘i and elsewhere. !",The Hawaii Minority/Underserved NCORP,9774578,UG1CA189804,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Guam ', ' Hawaii ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Hospitals ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Japanese ', ' Japanese Population ', ' Leadership ', ' Patients ', "" Physicians' Offices "", ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' survivorship ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Decision Aid ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Filipino ', ' Rural ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Oncologist ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Koreans ', ' Guideline Adherence ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' cultural competence ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Clinical Oncology ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Advocate ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Community Oncology ', ' CCOP ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' screening ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' underserved minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' racial minority ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' Native Hawaiian ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer ', ' LGBTQ ', ' financial toxicity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,UG1,2019,1433499,0.10371194823454301
"Kaiser Permanente NCI National Community Oncology Research Program, NCORP ASTRACT The Kaiser Permanente (KP) NCORP Community Site is committed to the principle that including community providers and a diverse patient population is essential to advancing oncology research. The KP NCORP Community Site has decades of experience conducting cancer clinical trial, care delivery, and disparities research. During the first funding cycle, the KP NCORP Community Site brought the benefits of our racially and ethnically diverse membership, increased access/accrual to clinical trials, and conducted cancer care delivery research. The KP NCORP Community Site was exceptionally successful with both total and specific trial enrollment to studies with our affiliated research bases. In 2017, for example, the KP NCORP Community Site was the second-highest enrolling member of SWOG for total accrual and the highest for CTEP-funded, SWOG-credited trials. In addition, KP NCORP Community Site clinicians and population scientists served on numerous NCI and Research Base Steering, Scientific, and Working Group Committees, making important contributions to the NCORP research agenda. In the next funding cycle, we will continue to participate in this integrated national network of community organizations to increase the involvement of community oncologists, other medical specialists, and our patients. Continued participation in multi-institutional cancer control, prevention, and care delivery research, as well as quality-of-life studies embedded within treatment and imaging studies conducted under the NCORP and NCTN, will benefit the community at large. Our clinician and population scientists will continue to serve on NCI and Research Base committees and provide insight into clinical significance, identifying care disparities, and provide input on feasibility during protocol development.

"Cancer Research of Wisconsin and Northern Michigan (CROWN) Consortium The Cancer Research of Wisconsin and Northern Michigan (CROWN) Consortium is a collaboration between three of the largest cancer centers in Wisconsin: St. Vincent Hospital of the Hospital Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis (St. Vincent Hospital through the Saint Vincent Hospital Cancer Centers (SVHCC)), Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare - Southeast Wisconsin, Inc., Columbia St. Mary’s, Inc., and Ministry Health Care, Inc. (Ascension Wisconsin (AW)), and Aspirus, Inc. (Aspirus). With SVHCC as the project/performance primary site, the three main institutions and their cooperating affiliates provide access to National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored clinical trials to community members throughout Wisconsin and northern Michigan. The consortium covers an extensive catchment area that includes both rural and urban counties, as well as minority and underserved communities. The CROWN Consortium looks to broaden recruitment capabilities, regularly share best practices through established consortium committees, reach a more diversified patient portfolio, and implement cancer care delivery research (CCDR) at multiple affiliate locations. In addition, the consortium will actively participate and engage in NCORP Research Base trials beyond accrual by serving on committees, contributing to protocol development, and developing young investigators to be engaged with clinical research. The CROWN Consortium brings together an experienced research infrastructure with a multidisciplinary team of qualified investigators across many areas of clinical research including medical and radiation oncology, palliative care and pediatric oncology. The consortium provides a vast portfolio of cancer control, prevention, and care delivery, biospecimen, screening/post-treatment surveillance trials, as well as treatment and imaging clinical studies to the community setting. As a result, the CROWN Consortium will address gaps in clinical research in rural, urban, minority, and underserved populations. The CROWN Consortium will address this by the following specific aims: 1) Broaden CROWN Consortium participation in NCI-sponsored clinical trials by expanding recruitment, clinical capabilities, and sharing of resources; 2) Expand recruitment and retention of urban, rural, racial and ethnic minorities, and other underrepresented patient populations; 3) Execute high- quality Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) throughout the CROWN Consortium; and 4) Increase investigator engagement in NCORP initiatives by contributing to best practices and research findings.

"National Capital Area (NCA) Minority/Underserved NCORP Abstract The National Capital Area (NCA) Minority/Underserved NCORP will be based at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC), comprising Medstar Georgetown University Hospital (MGUH) and MedStar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC) as the primary affiliate, with a catchment area comprising 48.3% non-Latino Blacks (NLB) and 10.6% Hispanics/Latinos (H/L) that includes Washington, D.C. and adjacent counties in Maryland and Virginia. MWHC serves predominantly, i.e., > 85% minority and underserved populations; and treats more than 2,000 predominantly minority cancer patients and 48,000 outpatients, annually. The cancer burden and disparities are greatest among NLB population in the catchment area as evident by some of the highest mortality rates in the nation for breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers. Among the H/L population, cancer is the leading cause of death with H/L patients typically presenting at a later stage compared to Non-Latino White (NLW) patients. High rates of preventable cancer risk factors such as obesity, physical inactivity, and smoking, coupled with much lower screening rates for certain cancers, such as colorectal and cervical cancers in minorities contribute to the cancer disparities seen in the catchment area. The NCA NCORP proposes to address one of the most significant factors associated with these cancer disparities - limited access to optimal and cutting edge prevention, cancer control, and cancer care delivery by increasing awareness and providing access to cancer clinical trials among NLB and H/L in the catchment area. LCCC’s Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities Research (OMH), represents the community outreach arm that is led by Dr. Adams-Campbell, that has established viable academic-community partnerships that enable the NCA NCORP to conduct clinical research in areas of prevention, control, screening, health disparities, and cancer care delivery among the minority populations of interest. In light of an aging population and the increasing number of cancer survivors, this NCORP has the expertise and leadership as evident by demonstrable research in these areas that address cancer control and patient centered cancer care delivery. Furthermore, the ability to address cancer prevention and control among adolescents and young adults (AYA) is also a key strength of our team. The NCA NCORP will address the needs of our catchment area via cancer prevention, control, screening as well as treatment and imaging studies. The specific aims of the proposed National Capital Area NCORP are to: (1) Design and participate in clinical trials in cancer clinical research that improves the quality of care and the health outcomes of the US population in our catchment area; (2) Increase the participation of the greater DC area’s community oncologists and medical specialists and their patients in NCORP-led clinical research; and (3) Expand health disparities research focused on clinical research participation via community outreach, engagement, and education. Project Narrative The National Capital Area (NCA) Minority/Underserved NCORP, based at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) and comprises MedStar Georgetown University Hospital (MGUH) and MedStar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC), will conduct cancer clinical research towards efforts to reduce cancer-related disparities and health care outcomes.

"Implementing Palliative Care: Learning Collaborative vs. Technical Assistance Project Summary    The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommends “…combined standard oncology care and  palliative care…early in the course of illness for any patient with metastatic cancer and/or high symptom  burden”. Unfortunately, early palliative care is not routinely incorporated into treatment plans at the onset of  advanced diagnosis, thereby depriving patients of potential quality of life benefits, especially low access  populations including minorities and rural-­dwellers. The problem is that we do not know how to best assist  health systems wanting to integrate early palliative care services into their usual oncology care. Virtual  Learning Collaboratives (VLCs), comprised of multiple health systems that work together virtually to implement  an evidence-­based practice, offer a solution. VLC features include the formation of quality improvement teams,  group problem solving, and data reporting/feedback. Despite widespread use of VLCs in healthcare, few  studies have evaluated their effectiveness. To address this gap, we propose to test the effectiveness of a VLC  implementation strategy on integration of an evidenced-­based model of early concurrent oncology palliative  care called ENABLE (Educate, Nurture, Advise, Before Life Ends). ENABLE is the only evidence-­based,  scalable early palliative care model promoted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Research Tested  Intervention Program. Guided by the RE-­AIM framework and using Proctor’s Outcomes for Implementation  Research model, we propose a cluster-­randomized trial with 48 NCI Community Oncology Research Program  (NCORP) practices implementing ENABLE to evaluate the effectiveness of a Virtual Learning Collaborative  (VLC) compared to typical implementation consisting of limited technical assistance (TA). In this hybrid type III  design implementation effectiveness trial, we will compare two implementation strategies in real world  oncology practices to determine Implementation (ENABLE uptake), Service, and Patient outcomes. Study aims  are: 1) Compare the effectiveness of VLC vs. TA on ENABLE program uptake, measured as the proportion of  patients at participating NCORP practices who complete the ENABLE program;? 2) Compare the effectiveness  of VLC vs. TA on NCORP practices implementation teams’ fidelity to ENABLE and assigned implementation  strategy;? 3) Compare NCORP practices randomized to VLC or TA on patient and caregiver quality of life (QOL)  and mood outcomes;? and 4) Determine the relationship between ENABLE program uptake and fidelity and  patients’ QOL and mood across the two strategies. This research will impact public health by addressing a  knowledge gap on appropriate strategies to implement scalable evidence-­based palliative care practices while  reducing the disparity of sub-­optimal cancer care for advanced cancer patients.   Project Narrative    The proposed research is relevant to public health in two ways. First, the ENABLE (Educate, Nurture, Advise,  Before Life Ends) early palliative care telehealth model seeks to improve outcomes (i.e., quality of life,

"Cancer Center Support Grant P30 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC), a consortium with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), is a matrix organization under the aegis of the UC Davis Health System and University of California, Davis. Two hundred and four members are organized into six programs, supported by eight shared resources, and led by Senior Leadership in order to use transdisciplinary, translational, and transformative research to address the following problems: With a rapidly aging population, 40 million Americans over the age of 65 are alive today and 390,000 will die from cancer this year. In 15 years, approximately, 74 million Americans of this age will be alive and cancer mortality will be ~730,000/year. The present methods by which new cancer therapies have been developed have met with a disappointing failure rate; therefore, improved translational methods are needed. So too are integrated programs that combine physical sciences, biomedical technology, and functional imaging to develop new therapies and delivery modalities as well as methods for functional evaluation and enhanced detection to determine, in a non-toxic fashion, if therapies will work. Two main foci are used to address these problems:  1) Reducing disparities in the cancer burden  2) Tackling advanced cancer by adapting molecularly targeted therapy through our patient derived  xenograft program (PDX) and canine patients to truly develop personalized medicine. Each of these uses a multi-disciplinary approach, combining expertise from across programs (Molecular Oncology, Comparative Oncology, Cancer Therapeutics, Population Sciences and Health Disparities, Prostate Urothelial Cancer, and Biomedical Technology), leveraging the UC Davis expertise (e.g., School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Biological Sciences, Department of Biomedical Technology), and with external partners (the Jackson Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Foundation Medicine). Seven Innovation Groups enhance collaborative interactions and proposals with focus on translating basic and technological findings into grants and investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Beyond that, the UCDCCC’s robust clinical trials program enables these discoveries to be translated into patient benefits. The portfolio consist of NCI awards to fund Phase I, II, and III trials, COG and NCI Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium trials, and a strong portfolio of IITs. These are implemented by a cadre of clinical scientists (11 of whom were recruited in the past funding period) who function as the interface of translational and clinical research. The catchment area (13 counties surrounding Sacramento county) is benefited through, among other activities, a city-wide early phase clinical trials program and the UCDCCC Cancer Care Network, through which the resources and expertise of a comprehensive cancer center are brought to disadvantaged and rural areas while keeping patients in their home communities. Finally, in this world of ever-changing cancer care delivery models, combined with an increasing numbers of patients seeking help and increasing complexities of treatments available, we are building a robust cancer supportive/psycho oncology program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer and its effects are an ever-increasing problem at the population and individual levels. The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center's research is aimed at reducing this burden through cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment that is truly precision and personalized.

"Sanford Community Cancer Program of the North Central Plains (NCORP) PROJECT SUMMARY The Sanford Community Cancer Program (SCCP) remains committed to its original goals and aims as stated in our 2013 application. The SCCP continues to increase patient participation in cancer control, prevention, care delivery, treatment, and imaging studies across its expanding network. The rural communities of the upper Midwest and Central Plains represent a large underserved population for cancer treatment, care delivery and clinical trials (PMID:24097196 PMID:22046848 PMID:19621978). The reasons for this disparity are multi- factorial but a main obstacle is access to services in rural regional areas. Sanford Health has developed a network of hospitals, cancer centers and clinics to provide high-quality, multi-disciplinary cancer treatment, clinical trials, and cancer care delivery to this underserved area. Sanford Health has designated cancer care as a Center of Excellence; elevating cancer care as a top priority to the patients it serves. The SCCP has expanded from five to seven components in the past five years, adding two new components to improve trial access in rural and underserved areas. It is hypothesized that this disparity in care for this rural population can be improved by utilizing the organized SCCP network community. This proposal describes how the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) partnership will help deliver clinical care and offer clinical trials across the rural area served by the SCCP. This will be accomplished through the following aims:  1. Maintain and enhance robust accrual to NCI Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) supported  clinical trials through seven components.  2. Address disparities in clinical trial accrual in underserved and underrepresented populations to  increase participation.  3. Cultivate innovative access points to address barriers to clinical trial accrual through outreach  and telemedicine.  4. Expand Cancer Care Delivery Research infrastructure. Through these four aims the Sanford Community Cancer Program will continue to offer NCI clinical trials and provide state-of-the-art cancer treatment and cancer care delivery to millions of people across six states in rural America. The SCCP's ability to provide clinical trials through outreach and telemedicine to this underserved rural population of patients increases their opportunity for participation in a trial as a treatment option. Telemedicine services are currently provided in existing Sanford Clinics in rural communities to deliver oncology consultations, surveillance exams and chemotherapy oversight. As a community based health care organization, the SCCP will participate in the development and implementation of cancer care delivery research to better understand and improve patient outcomes. The SCCP will design and develop additional community based investigator-initiated Cancer Care Delivery pilot projects with the goal to collaborate with the SCCP's primary Research Bases. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Sanford Community Cancer Program (SCCP) covers rural communities of the upper Midwest and Central Plains representing a large underserved population for cancer treatment, care delivery and clinical trials.

"Children's Oncology Group NCORP Research Base Project Summary The prognosis for children with cancer has improved dramatically over the past decades with an overall 5-year survival rate now at 84%. However, the late effects of cancer treatment, including permanent organ and tissue damage, hormonal and reproductive dysfunction and second cancers, are of special concern, with more than 40% of the estimated 360,000 survivors of childhood cancer experiencing a significant health-related quality of life complication from childhood cancer and its treatment. In addition, progress for a number of childhood cancers remains limited with approximately 50% of children with acute myelogenous leukemia, 50% of children with high-risk neuroblastoma, and more than 90% of children with brainstem glioma, still succumbing to their disease. The Children’s Oncology Group (COG), the world’s largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and adolescent cancer research, and its multidisciplinary research teams comprised of more than 9,000 members, conducts research at more than 220 leading children’s hospitals, universities, and cancer centers. This proposal is for the COG NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base to continue its collaborative research work for our 26 community and 16 minority/underserved NCORP sites. With COG’s significant scientific, statistical, data management and information technology infrastructure, we seek to conduct pediatric clinical trials to define optimal treatments, and conduct laboratory research that will translate into more effective treatments with reduced side effects. The COG directly addresses the NCORP goals of providing access to state-of-the-art cancer treatment at community sites while conducting research in cancer control, including post-treatment surveillance/survivorship, and cancer care delivery. We promote the participation of community-based investigators in all of COG’s research, governance and administration and in NCORP Network activities. The COG’s research goals are to reduce overall mortality and morbidity, decrease acute and delayed treatment-related toxicities, and develop more effective ways of delivering care to children, adolescents and young adults. The COG NCORP Research Base is uniquely positioned to elucidate the impact of different health care delivery characteristics on outcomes, to identify determinants of poorer outcomes in underserved groups including adolescents and young adults, and to develop targeted strategies aimed at eliminating disparities and improving efficiencies for the delivery of cancer care in young persons with cancer. Project Narrative The Children’s Oncology Group (COG) is the world’s largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and adolescent cancer research with more than 9,000 members at over 220 leading children’s hospitals, universities, and cancer centers across the U.S., Canada and other countries.

These are implemented by a cadre of clinical scientists (11 of whom were recruited in the past funding period) who function as the interface of translational and clinical research. The catchment area (13 counties surrounding Sacramento county) is benefited through, among other activities, a city-wide early phase clinical trials program and the UCDCCC Cancer Care Network, through which the resources and expertise of a comprehensive cancer center are brought to disadvantaged and rural areas while keeping patients in their home communities. Finally, in this world of ever-changing cancer care delivery models, combined with an increasing numbers of patients seeking help and increasing complexities of treatments available, we are building a robust cancer supportive/psycho oncology program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer and its effects are an ever-increasing problem at the population and individual levels. The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center's research is aimed at reducing this burden through cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment that is truly precision and personalized. Unique research strategies include the use of patient-derived xenografts, canine clinical trials, and state-of-the-art imaging, all of which is focused on translating discoveries into innovative clinical trials that ultimately improve the lives of patients and families with cancer.",Cancer Center Support Grant P30,9906329,P30CA093373,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' domestic dog ', ' canine ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' Dogs ', ' Canine Species ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Patients ', ' physical science ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Veterinary Schools ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Talents ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Veterinary Medicine ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Generations ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Heterograft ', ' Transcend ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' molecular oncology ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' member ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Modality ', ' Biomedical Technology ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Genomic Stability ', ' Genome Stability ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Detection ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' CCSG ', ' Cancer Grant Supplements (P30) ', ' P30 Grant ', ' P30 Award ', ' Cancer Grant Supplements ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Molecular ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Oncogenic ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' comparative ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' population health ', ' oncology program ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' improved outcome ', ' molecular targeted therapies ', ' molecular targeted treatment ', ' molecular targeted therapeutics ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' recruit ', ' Service delivery model ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' health care delivery model ', ' care delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' oncology trial ', ' investigator-initiated trial ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P30,2019,89478,0.015294446579397119
"SPORE in Brain Cancer SUMMARY: OVERALL The overarching goal of this Brain Cancer SPORE renewal application is to improve the notoriously poor outcome of patients with glioblastoma (GBM). This goal will be achieved through the development of a multidisciplinary and highly translational research program that seeks to discover and rapidly translate novel and mechanistically diverse treatment strategies, including biological, immunological and targeted strategies, and by developing prognostic and predictive biomarkers that inform individualized approaches to GBM treatment, while also exploring pathogenesis and risk through genetic-based epidemiological studies in minority populations. By pursuing the strategies of this research program, all projects in the current funding period (2013-18) have successfully transitioned from the bench to clinical trials, including testing of a novel oncolytic virus, Delta-24- RGD, in multiple clinical trials; completing a biological-endpoint Phase II clinical trial of a PI3K-targeted agent, BKM-120; meeting IND requirements for a first-in-human trial of a new immune-modulatory p-STAT-3 inhibitor, WP1066; and validating prognostic biomarkers in clinical trial datasets, while also testing a molecular predictor of radiation sensitivity. In this renewal application we propose three translational research projects that organically evolved from the successes of our current SPORE, and which are supported by four mission-critical Cores (Administrative, Pathology/Biorepository, Biostatistics/ Bioinformatics, Animal). Our Developmental Research Program (DRP) and Career Enhancement Program (CEP) continue as incubators of new projects and portals for new investigators. The aims of our projects are: Project 1: Exploit the capacity of Delta-24-RGD to activate anti-glioma immunity by completing a clinical trial combining Delta-24-RGD with Pembrolizumab, and by testing next-generation Delta-24-RGD viruses that are armed with immune stimulatory molecules: OX40L, GITRL, and 4-1BBL, while analyzing anti-Ad5 antibodies as a biomarker in response to therapy. Project 2: Attack metabolic vulnerabilities of GBMs through the development and clinical testing of a novel inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), IACS-010759, that efficiently kills GBMs harboring genetic or epigenetic mutations that impair glycolysis (e.g. ENO1 deletions), and by evaluating a new hypoxia-responsive PET probe, 18F-FAZA, as a readout of OxPhos inhibition and target engagement of IACS-010759. Project 3: Decipher germline and somatic genomic landscape of gliomas in Black and Hispanic minority populations, whose prognosis and survival differ than GBM patients of White European descent. Germline SNP data will be combined with extensive molecular profiling in case-matched tumors. A detailed analysis will be performed to determine ancestry composition and how it influences risk for gliomas and clinical outcome in minorities. NARRATIVE: OVERALL Over the past 20 years, advances in the treatment of glioblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor, have been only incremental. If successful, the research proposed in this Brain Cancer SPORE renewal application will legitimize novel, mechanistically unique therapies and decipher the genomic landscape of gliomas in minority populations, thereby changing the standards of care for all patients with human gliomas, including underserved minorities.",SPORE in Brain Cancer,9702984,P50CA127001,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult

"A Lead Academic Participating Site in Oklahoma for the Design and Conduct of NCTN Clinical Trials Abstract The Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC) at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) plays a crucial role in providing Oklahomans with access to National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and other clinical trials, thereby helping to raise the standard of care in the State and region. At the national level, the SCC has provided significant leadership in the design and conduct of NCTN clinical trials. In 2014, the SCC was designated a Lead Academic Participating Site (LAPS) in the NCTN. Since that time, it has worked to advance the following Specific Aims: (1) providing scientific leadership and coordination with NCTN components to design and conduct NCTN clinical trials for newly developed therapies, including multi-modality treatments, combinations of novel agents, molecularly based treatments, Precision Medicine screening, and advanced imaging approaches; (2) effectively integrating scientific expertise and clinical trials management capabilities at the SCC in order to activate, conduct and complete NCTN clinical trials in an efficient, timely and compliant manner; and (3) accomplishing Aims 1 and 2 within the context of providing high-quality cancer care and access to NCTN clinical trials for all Oklahomans, with a special emphasis on the State's underserved populations which experience disproportionately high rates of cancer health disparities. To advance Aim 3, the SCC utilizes patient navigators, social workers and targeted educational information to address barriers to enrolling patients on NCTN and other clinical trials. Specifically, the SCC has implemented an innovative American Indian (AI) Patient Navigation program to serve the Oklahoma's large AI population and promote enrollment to NCTN and other clinical trials for this population under-represented in clinical research. Clinical research activities at the SCC are overseen by a well-defined governance structure and supported by a centralized Clinical Trials Office (CTO) that manages regulatory, data management, study coordination, informatics, quality assurance, and biospecimen acquisition for all cancer clinical trials. The CTO functions as a core resource and receives funding from a variety of sources in addition to clinical trial direct cost dollars, allowing it to be proactive in faculty and staff education and career development, and leading to enhanced expertise and support capabilities. The collective knowledge base and cross-training within the CTO allows for adequate staffing and knowledge at all levels of research activity and ensures a coordinated research team approach for clinical research. The SCC is a Main Voting Member for NRG Oncology and the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, and it is a Full Member of SWOG and ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group. It has worked efficiently and expeditiously with the respective Network Group operations, data management, and statistical centers to accomplish the Specific Aims of the grant. Relevance Statement This proposal is directly relevant to public health. As a Lead Academic Participating Site in the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN), the Stephenson Cancer Center will directly contribute to the design and conduct of NCTN clinical trials for newly developed therapies, including multi-modality treatments, combinations of novel agents, Precision Medicine screening, and advanced imaging approaches.

"New Mexico Clinical Trials Node: Clinical research and practice to address substance use in diverse, rural and underserved populations ABSTRACT NM is an epicenter of the opioid crisis in the US, with one of the highest overdose mortality rates since 1990. Both heroin-attributable opioid deaths and deaths from prescription opioids have increased, especially in Hispanic and American Indian/Alaska Native groups. Many challenging social determinants, including poverty and unemployment contribute to high rates of OUD in NM. Our group is ideally suited to lead a NIDA CTN Node because of the breadth and depth of our involvement in OUD research, extensive clinical trials experience, intimate connection with the ECHO Institute and its use for expanding access to SUD treatments, links with AI/AN researchers and clinicians, our proven ability to recruit diverse rural populations to participate in research, as well as informatics and data science capacity. The Aims of the NM Node are to: 1) develop and maintain a highly efficient platform to conduct clinical trials that will inform evidence-based prevention and treatment of OUD; 2) collaborate on and lead research that addresses and improves outcomes across the OUD Cascade of Care (CoC); 3) promote uptake of best-practices in OUD prevention and care in NM and nationwide through effective dissemination of evidence-based innovations. The expected impacts will be expanded research in diverse, rural and underserved populations impacted by the opioid crisis, and increased capacity of providers and researchers to collaborate on, lead, and propose impactful research. NM Node research will ensure the development of robust and generalizable methods for prevention, identification, and treatment of OUD including evaluation and modification of the CoC expanding the local and national knowledge base. Our dissemination aim will ensure a productive cycle of engagement and translation of evidence-based practices and promote a sustained positive impact on the OUD CoC in communities in NM and nationwide. Our proposal builds on multiple assets: 1) a strong alliance with the primary care health providers in (i) an existing PBRN (RIOS Net) that extends into rural NM, (ii) UNM community-based primary care clinics; (iii) and providers of SUD/ and OUD treatment at multiple rural and urban sites across NM including over 400 that have engaged with ECHO learning networks; 2) 15 years of prior CTN and protocol management experience; 3) expertise conducting research including clinical trials with patients with SUD and OUD; 4) leadership in health services including Project ECHO, informatics, and implementation research; 5) access to unique and diverse communities and patient populations, including medically underserved, rural, Hispanic and American Indian; 6) strong clinical and educational expertise in MOUD and 7) our strength in behavioral interventions for SUD, centered in CASAA . PROJECT NARRATIVE The New Mexico Node will leverage the strong research alliance that has been forged between University of New Mexico researchers and providers of clinical care across the state, working in primary care, behavioral health, maternal/child health, adolescent, public health, and criminal justice settings. By extending the reach of the NIDA CTN to the “majority minority” population of NM, we will play an integral role in establishing best practices for treatment of OUD/SUDs in uniquely diverse, rural populations. Our team’s extensive SUD/OUD expertise in implementation of clinical trials, behavioral health interventions informatics, workforce development, education/knowledge dissemination, and harm reduction will allow us to make an outsized contribution to improvement of public health via prevention and treatment of OUD.","New Mexico Clinical Trials Node: Clinical research and practice to address substance use in diverse, rural and underserved populations",9938535,UG1DA049468,"['American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Heroin ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disulfiram ', ' Antabuse ', ' Tetraethylthiuram Disulfide ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemic ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Understanding the effects of the Oncology Care Model on cancer care for dual eligible patients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Lindsey Herrel, MD, MS is a urologic oncologist and junior health services researcher focused on improving cancer care for vulnerable populations through health policy reform. Dr. Herrel's long-term career goal is to become an independent surgeon-scientist evaluating healthcare policies that impact vulnerable populations with cancer, with the ability to translate research findings through healthcare policy reform. Research Context: Nearly 900,000 Medicare beneficiaries are diagnosed with cancer annually, with costs exceeding $34 billion. The Oncology Care Model, which is the first alternative payment model in cancer, incentivizes physicians to provide higher quality care at a lower cost. For dual eligible beneficiaries who qualify for Medicare due to elderly status and Medicaid due to low income, programs such as OCM that reward improvements in quality and reductions spending through care coordination, may offer a unique opportunity to improve cancer care for these vulnerable populations. However, this program may also lead to adverse selection and limited access if financial incentives are not properly aligned. Specific Aims: 1) To better understand practice level variation in OCM participation for dual eligible beneficiaries. 2) To examine the effect of OCM participation on quality of cancer care and spending for duals. 3) To evaluate the impact of alternative payment strategies on cancer care for dual eligible beneficiaries. Research Plan: Dr. Herrel will use Medicare claims and methodology consistent with current policy to characterize practices participating in OCM, in particular where duals are receiving cancer care. She will then use advanced econometric methods to evaluate the effect of the OCM policy on improving quality and reducing spending for duals. Finally, she will determine if current financial incentives are properly aligned with caring for duals and will assess if alternate payment strategies may provide greater motivation to care for duals. Career Development Plan: In parallel with this research plan and under the guidance of well- established mentors, Dr. Herrel will develop expertise in: 1) health equity for vulnerable populations and dual eligible beneficiaries; 2) legislative and regulatory aspects of health policy; 3) advanced econometric analyses for policy evaluation and simulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Oncology Care Model is the first alternative payment model in cancer care and is designed to improve quality of cancer care and reduce overall spending. Dual eligible beneficiaries, with their complex medical and social care needs, may significantly benefit from the increased care coordination and resources offered through this policy, or may have limited access to care if financial incentives are improperly aligned.

"SPeCTRE 2.0: The Sunflower Pediatric Clinical Trials Research Extension Project Summary/Abstract Children living in rural and underserved communities experience poorer health and worse health outcomes than children living in other areas. Our state, Kansas, exemplifies this problem, with rural children having lower immunization rates, higher infant mortality rates, and higher rates of obesity than their urban and suburban counterparts. Also, children and families from rural and underserved areas are much less likely to participate in clinical trials, which could study these and other health conditions and ultimately lead to improvement in health for these rural and underserved children and families. The purpose of the current application is to propose that the state of Kansas, a largely rural state, renew its status as a Clinical Site of the Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN). Our goals with this application are: 1) to assure that rural and underserved children in Kansas participate in multicenter clinical trials research, and 2) to improve the infrastructure for pediatric clinical trials in our state. The current application, Sunflower Pediatric Clinical Trials Research Extension (SPeCTRE 2.0), has three primary aims focused on improving research capacity through professional skills development of clinicians and researchers in our state, expanding clinical trials to rural and underserved children in our state, and evaluating and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of clinical trials in the network. We propose a strong administrative team and detailed administrative plan to support this work and have an extensive network throughout our state to support our activities as planned. Our site was very productive during the initial funding cycle and will expand on these activities during SPeCTRE 2.0. We propose a very strong Clinical Skills Development Plan focused on implementation science and individualized training plans that capitalizes upon our strong existing campus resources and our Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) in Kansas called Frontiers. As noted in our Rural Engagement Plan, we plan to engage both communities and providers through our Primary Clinical Sites and our Stakeholder Advisory Committee Sites. We also note that Kansas is a highly rural state with a high volume of pediatric patients who are rural and underserved who we will bring to the network. Finally, our application includes a Clinical Trial Proposal of the CoVER (The Collaboration for Vaccine Education and Research) curriculum, which is a trial that may be considered by the network for potential future dissemination. The results of the current work could lead to improvement in the health of rural and underserved children in the state of Kansas and improvements in the infrastructure in our IDeA state to support future pediatric clinical trials. Project Narrative In this application we are renewing our commitment to the ECHO ISPCTN by creating SPeCTRE 2.0 a Clinical Site for the network from the state of Kansas. Our main goal is to enhance the health of children by providing answers to relevant research questions regarding the health of children living in rural and underserved areas in Kansas. We are expanding on the previous success of our site by the addition of new sites, expanding our training capacity of researchers and adding more experienced NIH funded mentors to this application.",SPeCTRE 2.0: The Sunflower Pediatric Clinical Trials Research Extension,10064519,UG1OD024943,"['Affect ', ' Area Health Education Centers ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Clinical Skills ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Immunization ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Kansas ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mentors ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rural Health ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Rural Community ', ' Specialist ', ' Sunflowers ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Telemedicine ', ' suburban ', ' suburbia ', ' suburb ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' programs ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Prevention Research ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' telehealth ', ' Address ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Pediatric Research ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' rural disparities ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' skill development ', ' skill acquisition ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' implementation science ', ' social health determinants ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' child patients ', ' pediatric patients ', ' education research ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' rural families ', ' rural Hispanic ', ' rural America ', ' rural underserved ', ' recruit ', ' Child Health ', ' Infrastructure ', ' treatment research ', ' ']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,UG1,2020,425502,0.07354086620590962
"Montana Pediatric Clinical Trials Site PROJECT SUMMARY During the first four years of the ECHO IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ECHO ISPCTN), the Montana Pediatric Clinical Trials Site (MPCTS) has been successful in building the necessary infrastructure, team, and partnerships to participate effectively in multi-center clinical trials. The newly formed infrastructure includes clinical and research offices, dedicated exam and consultation rooms for participants, database and computer facilities and clinical research expertise from several centers through the University of Montana. The research team is comprised of a pediatric clinician/scientist as principal investigator, two research nurses, an epidemiologist and a recently added second pediatrician. Each team member has gained experience through multiple professional development opportunities, which have included ECHO ISPCTN Data Coordinating and Operations Center-offered didactic presentations, manuscript writing team membership and leadership, clinical trial protocol development leadership, and most importantly the invaluable growth that occurs with participation in three ECHO ISPCTN clinical studies. The team is now well positioned to gain further from a robust clinical research skills development plan designed by a new Senior Faculty Development Leader, who has extensive expertise in both clinical trials and mentorship. We are ready to participate in the next phase of ongoing ECHO ISPCTN trials as well as clinical trials in development. To facilitate continued and successful pediatric clinical trial participation, we have established relationships with the major pediatric inpatient facilities in the state, including their healthcare providers and research institutions, as well as with outpatient pediatric practice groups and care providers throughout western Montana, including the Family Practice Medicine Residency and Partnership Health Center, a Federally Qualified Health Center. We have also gained support from a newly formed innovative rural outreach organization, Ahana, a telemedicine collaborative for afterhours care in rural communities. Our established and active engagement with two IDeA program-supported Clinical and Translational Research Centers in Montana has and will continue to serve as valuable resources in professional development, research design and biostatistics, and community and stakeholder engagement, the last of which is critical as we extend our ECHO ISPCTN activities into more rural areas of the state. The ECHO ISPCTN has provided a pathway for including sites in clinical trial research that have not historically done so. As we look toward the future, the overall goal is to build on the ECHO ISPCTN’s and MPCTS’s successes and leverage existing infrastructure to expand the reach of ECHO ISPCTN clinical trials into rural and underserved areas in Montana. More inclusive and generalizable pediatric clinical trials will improve both the quality of clinical trial research and the health of children across the ECHO ISPCTN. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Montana Pediatric Clinical Trials Site (MPCTS) at the University of Montana has been an effective member of the ECHO IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN). Prior to MPCTS, few pediatric clinical trials and even fewer in ECHO priority areas had been conducted in the state of Montana.

"NRG Oncology NCORP Research Base The objective of this proposal is to establish and maintain the NCORP (National Community Oncology Research Program) for the NRG Oncology research base. The NRG NCORP is the result of aligning the legacy CCOPs (Community Clinical Oncology Programs) from three NCI Cancer Cooperative Groups: NSABP, RTOG and GOG. These groups together have over almost 100 years of combined experience serving as CCOP Research Bases. NRG NCORP, comprised of a multi-disciplinary team of investigators and patient advocates, is poised to carry out the objectives of: 1) designing and conducting cancer prevention, control and screening clinical trials; 2) designing and embedding patient reported outcomes in both primary NCOPR trials as well as NRG therapeutic trials 3) designing and conducting cancer care delivery research; 4) enhancing community access to treatment and imaging trials conducted under the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and 5) conducting primary intervention trials and integrating health disparity research questions into cancer care delivery research and treatment trials. To allow NRG NCORP to meet these goals, the group will: participate fully in NRG Oncology leadership and will determine the scientific direction and prioritization of the NRG NCORP activities and resources and oversee the translational research, clinical trial activities, and correlative studies related to the aims of NRG NCORP. With the NRG Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC), this team will provide efficient, methodologically up-to-date trial design with a focus on NCORP specific needs such as patient-reported repeated longitudinal assessments and cluster-randomized designs. NRG NCORP will provide study monitoring, reporting, and analysis; build an infrastructure to support our cancer care delivery research agenda; provide comprehensive data management quality control and quality assurance programs to ensure high data integrity and timely data for analysis; leverage cutting edge information technology emphasizing security, timeliness, and efficiency of data collection and management; providing RT credentialing and quality assurance; and provide education and training for institutional Clinical Research Associates, Study Chairs, local Principal Investigators and others involved in the NRG NCORP research agenda. Further, to accomplish these aims NRG NCORP will engage fully with NCI-designated NCORP community physicians and patient advocates as well as the NCI and other NCI-sponsored entities (cooperative groups, cancer centers, SPOREs) to collaborate across the NCTN to improve cancer prevention and control, cancer care and outcomes, and quality of life for patients affected by cancer. NRG Oncology NCORP research will significantly impact cancer prevention, screening, control and care delivery, and bring state-of-the-art treatment trials to community centers where most cancer treatments are delivered. NRG NCORP will conduct high impact studies for patients with many types of solid tumors with a particular unique focus in both women's health and cancer control issues related to radiation therapy.

"Nephrotic Syndrome Rare Disease Clinical Research Network III ABSTRACT Focal and Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), Minimal Change Disease (MCD) and Membranous Nephropathy (MN), presenting as Nephrotic Syndrome (NS), are rare diseases causing catastrophic complications and end stage kidney disease, generating enormous individual, societal and economic burdens. The clinical, histopathology-based taxonomy of NS is inadequate and fails to capture the molecular bases of these diseases and does not adequately predict their natural history or response to therapy. A Precision Medicine (PM) approach is necessary to define NS in molecular terms, to identify therapeutic targets and match patients to treatments. NEPTUNE was applied an innovative, investigational strategy to improve the diagnosis, management and treatment of NS. In the first two project periods, a translational and clinical research infrastructure has been established, participants enrolled, biosamples collected, key collaborations forged and an outreach strategy deployed. NEPTUNE has established a robust investigative infrastructure encompassing 26 academic centers and two patient interest groups, has recruited more than 750 rigorously phenotyped NS participants with detailed clinical, histological, genetic, transcriptomic and proteomic data sets. This comprehensive information has been integrated in the NEPTUNE Knowledge Network for easy access by the NS research community. With substantial support from the patient interest group NephCure Kidney International, NEPTUNE has established robust training and ancillary study programs with 112 ancillary studies ranging from methods development to successful Phase II clinical trials. These critical advances have resulted in a significant interest in NS clinical trials, with more than 15 trials now in the advanced planning or enrollment phase. In this renewal application, we propose to leverage the NEPTUNE resources to catalyze discovery, training and outreach as we strive to improve health outcomes for individuals affected by NS. The overarching goal is to apply a PM approach to NS, leveraging the extensive NEPTUNE Knowledge Network established over the past 9 years. NEPTUNE will implement this PM strategy to permit discovery of novel therapeutic targets and deploy the patient stratification approach developed in the current funding cycle to help identify the right trial for the right patient at the right time: Patient stratification approaches will be utilized for targeted enrollment into clinical trials. Patients will undergo intense profiling at the time of disease presentation or at follow-up renal biopsy in order to match the disease mechanism active with ongoing clinical trials in a precompetitive, public private partnership with leading companies in the field. Training, pilot and ancillary study programs will continue with significant funding support from NKI. NEPTUNE will maintain its engagement with lay communities, clinicians, scientists, regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical industry to identify and move therapeutic targets to our patients through an effective translational research pipeline for NS. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Nephrotic Syndrome Network (NEPTUNE) has established a rich translational and clinical research infrastructure for more than 750 rigorously phenotyped study participants with detailed clinical, histological, genetic, transcriptomic and proteomic data sets used by 112 approved ancillary studies to-date. In the next funding cycle, NEPTUNE will intensify the mechanistic disease definition in the biopsy and pediatric cohorts and will offer a precision medicine approach to 425 study participants, matching the disease mechanism active in the individual patients' kidneys to the targeted clinical trials pursued by our private partners with the goal to deliver the right therapy for the right

"ECOG-ACRIN NCORP Research Base Project Summary The ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (EA) is dedicated to decreasing the burden of cancer. EA is a vibrant member of the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), focused on practice-changing clinical and translational research across the cancer care continuum from prevention and early detection, through the management of advanced disease and its impact. As an NCORP Research Base, EA has engaged community providers and researchers to develop a robust research portfolio that spans Cancer Prevention, Cancer Control, and Cancer Care Delivery, aligned with the overall scientific themes of precision oncology, immuno-oncology, reducing overdiagnosis and overtreatment, and leveraging novel biomarker platforms. Cancer control trials examine and intervene on challenges associated with cancer and treatment-related symptoms and concerns. EA's portfolio of therapeutic trials yield opportunities to apply patient-reported outcomes measurement science to quantify health-related quality of life, symptoms, and domains most relevant to patients in the context of evolving treatment paradigms. Behavioral and biomarker-driven symptom interventions aim to improve quality of life and cancer survivorship. Cardiotoxicity research aims to mitigate risk through quantifying cardiotoxicity associated with treatment, identifying groups at risk, and advancing interventions to reduce risk. Prevention trials embrace the NCI's broad definition of prevention to include primary prevention, cancer screening, and secondary prevention and aim to identify high risk groups for precision prevention strategies. Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) examines the complex interactions between patient, provider, and system factors that influence care, and adapts and evaluates interventions in heterogenous community oncology practices. Health equity research permeates EA science through embedding disparities-related research questions that span EA activities, adopting a broad view of underserved populations including adolescents and young adults, the elderly, racial and ethnic minorities, sexual and gender minorities and rural residents. Key collaborations with community-based oncology programs will ensure access to EA NCTN and NCORP trials in communities where patients receive their care. EA provides access to existing NCI-funded resources and a network of >10000 physicians, scientists, nurses, research associates (RAs), statisticians, biomedical information technologists, and patient advocates across approximately 600 institutions and organizations. EA has provided scientific leadership in the NCORP community through advancing rigorous, practice-changing clinical trials and translational research in cancer control, prevention and care delivery and is well poised to continue to support the NCI's mission to engage community-based diverse populations in cancer research. Project Narrative The primary goals of the ECOG-ACRIN NCORP Research Base are: 1) to advance our understanding of approaches to prevent cancer and cancer-related physical and psychological symptoms, and 2) to develop and evaluate strategies to translate advances in high quality cancer care delivery into community oncology settings, with the aim of reducing the burden of cancer.",ECOG-ACRIN NCORP

"Children's Oncology Group NCORP Research Base Project Summary The prognosis for children with cancer has improved dramatically over the past decades with an overall 5-year survival rate now at 84%. However, the late effects of cancer treatment, including permanent organ and tissue damage, hormonal and reproductive dysfunction and second cancers, are of special concern, with more than 40% of the estimated 360,000 survivors of childhood cancer experiencing a significant health-related quality of life complication from childhood cancer and its treatment. In addition, progress for a number of childhood cancers remains limited with approximately 50% of children with acute myelogenous leukemia, 50% of children with high-risk neuroblastoma, and more than 90% of children with brainstem glioma, still succumbing to their disease. The Children’s Oncology Group (COG), the world’s largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and adolescent cancer research, and its multidisciplinary research teams comprised of more than 9,000 members, conducts research at more than 220 leading children’s hospitals, universities, and cancer centers. This proposal is for the COG NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base to continue its collaborative research work for our 26 community and 16 minority/underserved NCORP sites. With COG’s significant scientific, statistical, data management and information technology infrastructure, we seek to conduct pediatric clinical trials to define optimal treatments, and conduct laboratory research that will translate into more effective treatments with reduced side effects. The COG directly addresses the NCORP goals of providing access to state-of-the-art cancer treatment at community sites while conducting research in cancer control, including post-treatment surveillance/survivorship, and cancer care delivery. We promote the participation of community-based investigators in all of COG’s research, governance and administration and in NCORP Network activities. The COG’s research goals are to reduce overall mortality and morbidity, decrease acute and delayed treatment-related toxicities, and develop more effective ways of delivering care to children, adolescents and young adults. The COG NCORP Research Base is uniquely positioned to elucidate the impact of different health care delivery characteristics on outcomes, to identify determinants of poorer outcomes in underserved groups including adolescents and young adults, and to develop targeted strategies aimed at eliminating disparities and improving efficiencies for the delivery of cancer care in young persons with cancer.

"Southern Consortium Node of the Clinical Trials Network Abstract  The Southern Consortium Node (SCN) has been an integral part of the NIDA-funded Clinical Trials Network (CTN) consortium since 2000, evolving to meet changing CTN needs and leading and contributing to a portfolio of compelling addiction science and treatment research projects with outstanding performance metrics. We have expanded our network throughout the Southeast and established close and collaborative working relationships with a diverse and geographically dispersed group of programs including primary care and medical specialty practices. We have a cost-effective system for accessing specialized expertise for specific CTN trials. We have solid collaborative relationships with community substance use disorder (SUD) treatment programs, primary care providers and governmental agencies that facilitate research, implementation and dissemination efforts. Our CTN efforts are complemented and enhanced by our statewide CTSA infrastructure, creating a research capacity that extends far beyond our academic home.  For this renewal, we propose to further expand our network to include six rural states in the Southeast with a research agenda focused on best practices for bringing evidence-based care to underserved rural populations across the full continuum of care. We will develop a Health Technology Core to facilitate exploration of the use of technology to address health disparities in SUD treatment. We will develop an Implementation Science Core and employ Learning Health System principles to move positive findings into our partnering practice systems, fulfilling the core CTN mission of moving evidence-based treatment beyond academic settings.  In sum, the SCN has demonstrated remarkable flexibility, creativity and the collaborative and innovative spirit required to meet new challenges and take advantage of growing CTN opportunities. We have gathered a multidisciplinary team with expertise in addiction psychiatry, clinical research, informatics, analytics, healthcare technology, dissemination and implementation science. We will employ our resources and expertise in innovative areas to address identified gaps in access, engagement and retention in treatment for individuals with SUDs. The SCN team looks forward to continued participation in the CTN consortium. Project Narrative The Clinical Trials Network (CTN) is a cooperative agreement between NIDA, treatment providers, and researchers throughout the nation in which science is being utilized as a vehicle to improve the treatment of substance use disorders.

"Cancer Research of Wisconsin and Northern Michigan (CROWN) Consortium The Cancer Research of Wisconsin and Northern Michigan (CROWN) Consortium is a collaboration between three of the largest cancer centers in Wisconsin: St. Vincent Hospital of the Hospital Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis (St. Vincent Hospital through the Saint Vincent Hospital Cancer Centers (SVHCC)), Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare - Southeast Wisconsin, Inc., Columbia St. Mary’s, Inc., and Ministry Health Care, Inc. (Ascension Wisconsin (AW)), and Aspirus, Inc. (Aspirus). With SVHCC as the project/performance primary site, the three main institutions and their cooperating affiliates provide access to National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored clinical trials to community members throughout Wisconsin and northern Michigan. The consortium covers an extensive catchment area that includes both rural and urban counties, as well as minority and underserved communities. The CROWN Consortium looks to broaden recruitment capabilities, regularly share best practices through established consortium committees, reach a more diversified patient portfolio, and implement cancer care delivery research (CCDR) at multiple affiliate locations. In addition, the consortium will actively participate and engage in NCORP Research Base trials beyond accrual by serving on committees, contributing to protocol development, and developing young investigators to be engaged with clinical research. The CROWN Consortium brings together an experienced research infrastructure with a multidisciplinary team of qualified investigators across many areas of clinical research including medical and radiation oncology, palliative care and pediatric oncology. The consortium provides a vast portfolio of cancer control, prevention, and care delivery, biospecimen, screening/post-treatment surveillance trials, as well as treatment and imaging clinical studies to the community setting. As a result, the CROWN Consortium will address gaps in clinical research in rural, urban, minority, and underserved populations. The CROWN Consortium will address this by the following specific aims: 1) Broaden CROWN Consortium participation in NCI-sponsored clinical trials by expanding recruitment, clinical capabilities, and sharing of resources; 2) Expand recruitment and retention of urban, rural, racial and ethnic minorities, and other underrepresented patient populations; 3) Execute high- quality Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) throughout the CROWN Consortium; and 4) Increase investigator engagement in NCORP initiatives by contributing to best practices and research findings. The CROWN Consortium represents a proven, high-performing addition to the NCORP network. The consortium will expand NCORP’s access to populations in Wisconsin and northern Michigan. The consortium will further NCORP Research Bases’ programs by providing a more representative population for studies, and by providing feedback on study design feasibility for community sites and for appropriateness for diverse participants. CROWN Consortium’s emphasis on understudied subgroups further underscores the value of CROWN Consortium to the NCORP network. Project Narrative Currently, cancer clinical research is predominantly performed at academic medical centers, partially due to the operational challenges and limitations of resources at community sites. A core premise of the NCORP network is expanding the reach and execution of cancer control, prevention and cancer care delivery research deeper into community settings which will diversify trial participants and accelerate promising treatments through clinical trials and into broader use. The CROWN Consortium supports the NCORP mission by leveraging a network of community sites throughout Wisconsin and northern Michigan with a shared mission, training, procedures, and clinical resources, and will be able to provide the necessary clinical support to offer improved enrollment numbers and diversity, enhancing study outcomes and reducing disparities.",Cancer Research of Wisconsin and Northern Michigan (CROWN) Consortium,10001479,UG1CA239769,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Feedback ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Hospitals ', ' Cancer Hospital ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medical Oncology ', ' Medically Underserved Area ', ' Mentors ', ' Michigan ', ' Mission ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' comfort care ', ' Patient Representative ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Wisconsin ', ' County ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Amish ', ' Rural ', ' Saints ', ' Radiation Oncology ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' Sister ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Location ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' protocol development ', ' cancer care ', ' Institution ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' patient cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' treatment compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Catchment Area ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Pediatric Oncology ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community setting ', ' patient population ', ' screening ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' clinical imaging ', ' recruit ', ' Healthcare Provider Shortage Areas ', ' health care professional shortage areas ', ' health professional shortage areas ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Rural Minority ', ' ']",NCI,ST.

"NRG Oncology NCORP Research Base The objective of this proposal is to establish and maintain the NCORP (National Community Oncology Research Program) for the NRG Oncology research base. The NRG NCORP is the result of aligning the legacy CCOPs (Community Clinical Oncology Programs) from three NCI Cancer Cooperative Groups: NSABP, RTOG and GOG. These groups together have over almost 100 years of combined experience serving as CCOP Research Bases. NRG NCORP, comprised of a multi-disciplinary team of investigators and patient advocates, is poised to carry out the objectives of: 1) designing and conducting cancer prevention, control and screening clinical trials; 2) designing and embedding patient reported outcomes in both primary NCOPR trials as well as NRG therapeutic trials 3) designing and conducting cancer care delivery research; 4) enhancing community access to treatment and imaging trials conducted under the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and 5) conducting primary intervention trials and integrating health disparity research questions into cancer care delivery research and treatment trials. To allow NRG NCORP to meet these goals, the group will: participate fully in NRG Oncology leadership and will determine the scientific direction and prioritization of the NRG NCORP activities and resources and oversee the translational research, clinical trial activities, and correlative studies related to the aims of NRG NCORP. With the NRG Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC), this team will provide efficient, methodologically up-to-date trial design with a focus on NCORP specific needs such as patient-reported repeated longitudinal assessments and cluster-randomized designs. NRG NCORP will provide study monitoring, reporting, and analysis; build an infrastructure to support our cancer care delivery research agenda; provide comprehensive data management quality control and quality assurance programs to ensure high data integrity and timely data for analysis; leverage cutting edge information technology emphasizing security, timeliness, and efficiency of data collection and management; providing RT credentialing and quality assurance; and provide education and training for institutional Clinical Research Associates, Study Chairs, local Principal Investigators and others involved in the NRG NCORP research agenda. Further, to accomplish these aims NRG NCORP will engage fully with NCI-designated NCORP community physicians and patient advocates as well as the NCI and other NCI-sponsored entities (cooperative groups, cancer centers, SPOREs) to collaborate across the NCTN to improve cancer prevention and control, cancer care and outcomes, and quality of life for patients affected by cancer. NRG Oncology NCORP research will significantly impact cancer prevention, screening, control and care delivery, and bring state-of-the-art treatment trials to community centers where most cancer treatments are delivered. NRG NCORP will conduct high impact studies for patients with many types of solid tumors with a particular unique focus in both women's health and cancer control issues related to radiation therapy.

Support of the NCTN includes formation of one of the founding organizations (North Central Cancer Treatment Group, now Alliance), Sustained leadership roles in the NCTN and in clinical trials, as well as active supporters of clinical trials. Multiple Mayo Clinic staff continue in current leadership roles within the NCTN or NCI sponsored activities related to the NCTN. Mayo Clinic remains committed to making NCTN trials a prominent part of its portfolio of clinical trials for cancer patients or patients at-risk for cancer. This commitment is reflected in the prioritization of NCTN trials over many other trials, the level of accrual to NCTN trials, further refinements to the activation and monitoring of progress of NCTN trials to ensure their success, the continued leadership role of Mayo Clinic physicians in the NCTN member organizations, and an on-going commitment of the MCCC to support this activity. Mayo Clinic physicians and researchers continue to have an active role in not only patient accrual to NCTN clinical trials, but to leadership in developing and leading trials. Mayo Clinic researchers also continue to be active in presenting the results of these trials at national and international meetings and high-impact journals, as described within the current grant application. Mayo Clinic researchers have continued to be active in performing subsequent analyses of the collected data, and meaningful use of the biospecimens collected from the trials to transform the science of cancer care. Mayo Clinic has also continued to focus on the development of junior investigators in the NCTN to ensure the continued active support of NCTN member organizations and the success of NCTN clinical research. Finally, Mayo Clinic is committed to making clinical trials available to all patients, regardless of their racial, ethnicity, or socioeconomic background. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mayo Clinic has a long tradition of clinical research and has been a supporter and active participant in the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). With over 1.3 million unique patients seen each year (of which over 120,000 are patients with cancer), Mayo Clinic is committed to making clinical trials available to all patients regardless of their racial, ethnicity, or socioeconomic background. A major factor in allowing this to occur is through Mayo Clinic's commitment to making NCTN trials a prominent part of its portfolio of clinical trials for cancer patients or patients at-risk for cancer.","NCI, National Clinical Trials Network Lead Academic Participating Site (LAPS) UG1",10062104,UG1CA232760,"['Arizona ', ' Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Florida ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Grant ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rural Population ', ' Universities ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' Site ', ' Ensure ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' Special Population ', ' named group ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' cancer care ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' ECOG ', ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' GOG ', ' Gynecologic Oncology Group ', ' International ', ' Mayo Clinic Cancer Center ', ' NSABP ', ' National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' ACRIN ', ' American College of Radiology Imaging Network ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Science ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' NCCTG ', ' North Central Cancer Treatment Group ', ' Monitor ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' NCI National Clinical Trials Network ', ' National Clinical Trials Network ', ' Minority Enrollment ', ' oncology clinical trial ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' recruit ', ' cognitive computing ', ' clinical trial enrollment ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,UG1,2020,170000,0.05250629854028208
"National Capital Area (NCA) Minority/Underserved NCORP Abstract The National Capital Area (NCA) Minority/Underserved NCORP will be based at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC), comprising Medstar Georgetown University Hospital (MGUH) and MedStar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC) as the primary affiliate, with a catchment area comprising 48.3% non-Latino Blacks (NLB) and 10.6% Hispanics/Latinos (H/L) that includes Washington, D.C. and adjacent counties in Maryland and Virginia. MWHC serves predominantly, i.e., > 85% minority and underserved populations; and treats more than 2,000 predominantly minority cancer patients and 48,000 outpatients, annually. The cancer burden and disparities are greatest among NLB population in the catchment area as evident by some of the highest mortality rates in the nation for breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers. Among the H/L population, cancer is the leading cause of death with H/L patients typically presenting at a later stage compared to Non-Latino White (NLW) patients. High rates of preventable cancer risk factors such as obesity, physical inactivity, and smoking, coupled with much lower screening rates for certain cancers, such as colorectal and cervical cancers in minorities contribute to the cancer disparities seen in the catchment area. The NCA NCORP proposes to address one of the most significant factors associated with these cancer disparities - limited access to optimal and cutting edge prevention, cancer control, and cancer care delivery by increasing awareness and providing access to cancer clinical trials among NLB and H/L in the catchment area. LCCC’s Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities Research (OMH), represents the community outreach arm that is led by Dr. Adams-Campbell, that has established viable academic-community partnerships that enable the NCA NCORP to conduct clinical research in areas of prevention, control, screening, health disparities, and cancer care delivery among the minority populations of interest. In light of an aging population and the increasing number of cancer survivors, this NCORP has the expertise and leadership as evident by demonstrable research in these areas that address cancer control and patient centered cancer care delivery. Furthermore, the ability to address cancer prevention and control among adolescents and young adults (AYA) is also a key strength of our team. The NCA NCORP will address the needs of our catchment area via cancer prevention, control, screening as well as treatment and imaging studies. The specific aims of the proposed National Capital Area NCORP are to: (1) Design and participate in clinical trials in cancer clinical research that improves the quality of care and the health outcomes of the US population in our catchment area; (2) Increase the participation of the greater DC area’s community oncologists and medical specialists and their patients in NCORP-led clinical research; and (3) Expand health disparities research focused on clinical research participation via community outreach, engagement, and education. Project Narrative The National Capital Area (NCA) Minority/Underserved NCORP, based at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) and comprises MedStar Georgetown University Hospital (MGUH) and MedStar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC), will conduct cancer clinical research towards efforts to reduce cancer-related disparities and health care outcomes.

"Expansion of Clinical Trials Access to Rural and Underserved Children of Louisiana Project Summary/Abstract Louisiana's children are some of the most vulnerable in the country and are disproportionately affected by a number of health disparities. Enhancing the ability to implement high quality clinical trials directed toward the five focus areas of the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program (pre-, peri-, and postnatal outcomes; obesity; upper and lower airways; neurodevelopment; and positive health) has the unique potential to improve health outcomes for all children in Louisiana and across the United States. With the establishment of the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN) in 2016, the Louisiana site consisting of researchers from Pennington Biomedical Research Center (PBRC) in Baton Rouge and Tulane University in New Orleans successfully enhanced pediatric research capacity and infrastructure to conduct clinical trials, trained new pediatric researchers, and participated in clinical trials implemented by the Network in the first cycle. This renewal will allow our Louisiana site to expand the reach of the ECHO ISPCTN to additional sites across the state (Children's Hospital New Orleans and Our Lady of the Lake Children's Hospital), to train additional pediatric researchers, and to conduct additional important clinical trials. Moreover, continuing to work with the established infrastructure and modeling the processes of inter-institutional collaboration created by the Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science Center (LA CaTS) Center (PI: John Kirwan; U54 GM104940; IDeA CTR) will allow for further dissemination and conduct of clinical trials across Louisiana. The ECHO ISPCTN with the assistance of NIH Project Scientists will identify research protocols of high priority appropriate to the Network's goals and objectives. Our local study team will ensure that study protocols proceed efficiently through regulatory and budgeting processes, are implemented effectively, and meet recruitment goals and timelines. We will ensure mentoring of our two junior faculty and appropriate training of our research staff. Moreover, the Senior Faculty Development Leader will work with the entire research team to implement a clinical research skills development program. By building and expanding the research infrastructure in Louisiana, developing uniform study protocols, and synergizing with other ECHO ISPCTN sites across the United States, the Louisiana ECHO ISPCTN site will continue to bring new discoveries to the children of Louisiana while addressing the health disparities that disproportionately affect the State. Project Narrative Louisiana's children are affected by many health problems at a higher rate compared to other states. This is especially true in rural areas and areas that have less access to healthcare. The goals of this proposal are to expand access to cutting-edge research for more children in Louisiana, to train future pediatric researchers, and to address the specific health needs of children locally and nationally. We will accomplish these goals by combining resources and a team of researchers from Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Tulane University, LSU Health Sciences Center, and the state's only 2

"Nephrotic Syndrome Rare Disease Clinical Research Network III ABSTRACT Focal and Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), Minimal Change Disease (MCD) and Membranous Nephropathy (MN), presenting as Nephrotic Syndrome (NS), are rare diseases causing catastrophic complications and end stage kidney disease, generating enormous individual, societal and economic burdens. The clinical, histopathology-based taxonomy of NS is inadequate and fails to capture the molecular bases of these diseases and does not adequately predict their natural history or response to therapy. A Precision Medicine (PM) approach is necessary to define NS in molecular terms, to identify therapeutic targets and match patients to treatments. NEPTUNE was applied an innovative, investigational strategy to improve the diagnosis, management and treatment of NS. In the first two project periods, a translational and clinical research infrastructure has been established, participants enrolled, biosamples collected, key collaborations forged and an outreach strategy deployed. NEPTUNE has established a robust investigative infrastructure encompassing 26 academic centers and two patient interest groups, has recruited more than 750 rigorously phenotyped NS participants with detailed clinical, histological, genetic, transcriptomic and proteomic data sets. This comprehensive information has been integrated in the NEPTUNE Knowledge Network for easy access by the NS research community. With substantial support from the patient interest group NephCure Kidney International, NEPTUNE has established robust training and ancillary study programs with 112 ancillary studies ranging from methods development to successful Phase II clinical trials. These critical advances have resulted in a significant interest in NS clinical trials, with more than 15 trials now in the advanced planning or enrollment phase. In this renewal application, we propose to leverage the NEPTUNE resources to catalyze discovery, training and outreach as we strive to improve health outcomes for individuals affected by NS. The overarching goal is to apply a PM approach to NS, leveraging the extensive NEPTUNE Knowledge Network established over the past 9 years. NEPTUNE will implement this PM strategy to permit discovery of novel therapeutic targets and deploy the patient stratification approach developed in the current funding cycle to help identify the right trial for the right patient at the right time: Patient stratification approaches will be utilized for targeted enrollment into clinical trials. Patients will undergo intense profiling at the time of disease presentation or at follow-up renal biopsy in order to match the disease mechanism active with ongoing clinical trials in a precompetitive, public private partnership with leading companies in the field. Training, pilot and ancillary study programs will continue with significant funding support from NKI. NEPTUNE will maintain its engagement with lay communities, clinicians, scientists, regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical industry to identify and move therapeutic targets to our patients through an effective translational research pipeline for NS. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Nephrotic Syndrome Network (NEPTUNE) has established a rich translational and clinical research infrastructure for more than 750 rigorously phenotyped study participants with detailed clinical, histological, genetic, transcriptomic and proteomic data sets used by 112 approved ancillary studies to-date. In the next funding cycle, NEPTUNE will intensify the mechanistic disease definition in the biopsy and pediatric cohorts and will offer a precision medicine approach to 425 study participants, matching the disease mechanism active in the individual patients' kidneys to the targeted clinical trials pursued by our private partners with the goal to deliver the right therapy for the right patient at the right time.",Nephrotic Syndrome Rare Disease Clinical Research Network III,10017205,U54DK083912,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Africa South

"Cancer Center Support Grant P30 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC), a consortium with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), is a matrix organization under the aegis of the UC Davis Health System and University of California, Davis. Two hundred and four members are organized into six programs, supported by eight shared resources, and led by Senior Leadership in order to use transdisciplinary, translational, and transformative research to address the following problems: With a rapidly aging population, 40 million Americans over the age of 65 are alive today and 390,000 will die from cancer this year. In 15 years, approximately, 74 million Americans of this age will be alive and cancer mortality will be ~730,000/year. The present methods by which new cancer therapies have been developed have met with a disappointing failure rate; therefore, improved translational methods are needed. So too are integrated programs that combine physical sciences, biomedical technology, and functional imaging to develop new therapies and delivery modalities as well as methods for functional evaluation and enhanced detection to determine, in a non-toxic fashion, if therapies will work. Two main foci are used to address these problems:  1) Reducing disparities in the cancer burden  2) Tackling advanced cancer by adapting molecularly targeted therapy through our patient derived  xenograft program (PDX) and canine patients to truly develop personalized medicine. Each of these uses a multi-disciplinary approach, combining expertise from across programs (Molecular Oncology, Comparative Oncology, Cancer Therapeutics, Population Sciences and Health Disparities, Prostate Urothelial Cancer, and Biomedical Technology), leveraging the UC Davis expertise (e.g., School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Biological Sciences, Department of Biomedical Technology), and with external partners (the Jackson Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Foundation Medicine). Seven Innovation Groups enhance collaborative interactions and proposals with focus on translating basic and technological findings into grants and investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Beyond that, the UCDCCC’s robust clinical trials program enables these discoveries to be translated into patient benefits. The portfolio consist of NCI awards to fund Phase I, II, and III trials, COG and NCI Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium trials, and a strong portfolio of IITs. These are implemented by a cadre of clinical scientists (11 of whom were recruited in the past funding period) who function as the interface of translational and clinical research. The catchment area (13 counties surrounding Sacramento county) is benefited through, among other activities, a city-wide early phase clinical trials program and the UCDCCC Cancer Care Network, through which the resources and expertise of a comprehensive cancer center are brought to disadvantaged and rural areas while keeping patients in their home communities. Finally, in this world of ever-changing cancer care delivery models, combined with an increasing numbers of patients seeking help and increasing complexities of treatments available, we are building a robust cancer supportive/psycho oncology program.

"The Hawaii Minority/Underserved NCORP The overall goal of the Hawaiʻi Minority/Underserved NCORP is to provide access and facilitate enrollment of Hawaii’s diverse, multiethnic population to NCI sponsored trials. Thus we will enhance accrual of underrepresented populations including Native Hawaiians, other Pacific Islanders, Asian-Americans (Chinese, Japanese, Filipino and Korean), adolescents and young adults (AYA), the elderly and sexual and gender minorities (LGBTQ). Our NCORP is the primary provider of NCI clinical trials and cancer care delivery research (CCDR) in the State of Hawaiʻi where nearly 75% of the population is comprised of multiple minority racial/ethnic groups. The Hawaiʻi M/U NCORP supports an integrated network of affiliates and sub-affiliates with the extensive menu of cancer studies, research infrastructure and data management. Our NCORP has successfully extended CCDR studies from the originally designated sites to other hospital affiliate sites with plans to further extend them to physician office sites. We solicit community input from Native Hawaiian and LGBTQ advocates to review the suitability of trials as well as to address their healthcare needs. Non medical oncology community investigators and staff have leadership responsibility in imaging, prevention and CCDR studies. Our NCORP leaders have extensive experience in cancer clinical trials, health care delivery and disparities. They have served on multiple NCI committees. Participation in NCI’s personalized medicine, cancer control, prevention, treatment and CCDR research will further reduce cancer health care disparities and the cancer burden for the people of Hawaiʻi and beyond. The Hawaiʻi Minority/Underserved NCORP aims to: 1) conduct cancer clinical trials and cancer care delivery research, 2) continue contributing to NCORP research bases and NCI priorities, and 3) enhance participation of Hawaii‘s diverse multiethnic and at risk population in NCI sponsored trials in order to reduce health care disparities and the burden of cancer for the people of Hawai‘i and elsewhere. !",The Hawaii Minority/Underserved NCORP,9993281,UG1CA189804,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Guam ', ' Hawaii ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitals ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Japanese Population ', ' Japanese ', ' Leadership ', ' Patients ', "" Physicians' Offices "", ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' survivorship ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Decision Aid ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Filipino ', ' Rural ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Oncologist ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Koreans ', ' Guideline Adherence ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' cultural competence ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Clinical Oncology ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Advocate ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Oncology ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' screening ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' oncology clinical trial ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' underserved minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' Native Hawaiian ', ' Infrastructure ', ' LGBTQ ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer ', ' financial toxicity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,UG1,2020,1334188,0.10371194823454301
"Cancer Center Support Grant P30 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC), a consortium with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), is a matrix organization under the aegis of the UC Davis Health System and University of California, Davis. Two hundred and four members are organized into six programs, supported by eight shared resources, and led by Senior Leadership in order to use transdisciplinary, translational, and transformative research to address the following problems: With a rapidly aging population, 40 million Americans over the age of 65 are alive today and 390,000 will die from cancer this year. In 15 years, approximately, 74 million Americans of this age will be alive and cancer mortality will be ~730,000/year. The present methods by which new cancer therapies have been developed have met with a disappointing failure rate; therefore, improved translational methods are needed. So too are integrated programs that combine physical sciences, biomedical technology, and functional imaging to develop new therapies and delivery modalities as well as methods for functional evaluation and enhanced detection to determine, in a non-toxic fashion, if therapies will work. Two main foci are used to address these problems:  1) Reducing disparities in the cancer burden  2) Tackling advanced cancer by adapting molecularly targeted therapy through our patient derived  xenograft program (PDX) and canine patients to truly develop personalized medicine. Each of these uses a multi-disciplinary approach, combining expertise from across programs (Molecular Oncology, Comparative Oncology, Cancer Therapeutics, Population Sciences and Health Disparities, Prostate Urothelial Cancer, and Biomedical Technology), leveraging the UC Davis expertise (e.g., School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Biological Sciences, Department of Biomedical Technology), and with external partners (the Jackson Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Foundation Medicine). Seven Innovation Groups enhance collaborative interactions and proposals with focus on translating basic and technological findings into grants and investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Beyond that, the UCDCCC’s robust clinical trials program enables these discoveries to be translated into patient benefits. The portfolio consist of NCI awards to fund Phase I, II, and III trials, COG and NCI Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium trials, and a strong portfolio of IITs. These are implemented by a cadre of clinical scientists (11 of whom were recruited in the past funding period) who function as the interface of translational and clinical research. The catchment area (13 counties surrounding Sacramento county) is benefited through, among other activities, a city-wide early phase clinical trials program and the UCDCCC Cancer Care Network, through which the resources and expertise of a comprehensive cancer center are brought to disadvantaged and rural areas while keeping patients in their home communities. Finally, in this world of ever-changing cancer care delivery models, combined with an increasing numbers of patients seeking help and increasing complexities of treatments available, we are building a robust cancer supportive/psycho oncology program.

"Children's Oncology Group NCORP Research Base Project Summary The prognosis for children with cancer has improved dramatically over the past decades with an overall 5-year survival rate now at 84%. However, the late effects of cancer treatment, including permanent organ and tissue damage, hormonal and reproductive dysfunction and second cancers, are of special concern, with more than 40% of the estimated 360,000 survivors of childhood cancer experiencing a significant health-related quality of life complication from childhood cancer and its treatment. In addition, progress for a number of childhood cancers remains limited with approximately 50% of children with acute myelogenous leukemia, 50% of children with high-risk neuroblastoma, and more than 90% of children with brainstem glioma, still succumbing to their disease. The Children’s Oncology Group (COG), the world’s largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and adolescent cancer research, and its multidisciplinary research teams comprised of more than 9,000 members, conducts research at more than 220 leading children’s hospitals, universities, and cancer centers. This proposal is for the COG NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base to continue its collaborative research work for our 26 community and 16 minority/underserved NCORP sites. With COG’s significant scientific, statistical, data management and information technology infrastructure, we seek to conduct pediatric clinical trials to define optimal treatments, and conduct laboratory research that will translate into more effective treatments with reduced side effects. The COG directly addresses the NCORP goals of providing access to state-of-the-art cancer treatment at community sites while conducting research in cancer control, including post-treatment surveillance/survivorship, and cancer care delivery. We promote the participation of community-based investigators in all of COG’s research, governance and administration and in NCORP Network activities. The COG’s research goals are to reduce overall mortality and morbidity, decrease acute and delayed treatment-related toxicities, and develop more effective ways of delivering care to children, adolescents and young adults. The COG NCORP Research Base is uniquely positioned to elucidate the impact of different health care delivery characteristics on outcomes, to identify determinants of poorer outcomes in underserved groups including adolescents and young adults, and to develop targeted strategies aimed at eliminating disparities and improving efficiencies for the delivery of cancer care in young persons with cancer. Project Narrative The Children’s Oncology Group (COG) is the world’s largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and adolescent cancer research with more than 9,000 members at over 220 leading children’s hospitals, universities, and cancer centers across the U.S., Canada and other countries.

"Linking population-based data sources to examine health disparities in clinical trial participation and outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  We propose a feasibility study to support the creation of a population-based data resource that has the potential for detailed, insightful studies about the practice and impact of cancer clinical trials. In 2000, the U.S. National Library of Medicine resource ClinicalTrials.gov was made publicly available. This resource contains details of clinical trials sponsored by the NIH, other Federal agencies, and non-profit and private organizations, including cancer clinical trials. In September 2008, Medicare claims were modified to include an identifier for the clinical trial to which a patient is enrolled, the National Clinical Trial (NCT) identifier. This is the same identifier used by ClinicalTrials.gov. In 2014, reporting of the NCT identifier became mandatory for all claims submitted to Medicare for clinical trial related services. Thus, from 2014 onwards, it is theoretically possible to identify nearly all Fee-for-Service (FFS) Medicare patients who are registered on a cancer clinical trial. It should also be possible to link these patients with detailed clinical trial information from ClinicalTrials.gov using the NCT identifier. These Medicare claims have been linked to other data sources such as the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program cancer registry and databases with information on hospitals and physicians. Therefore, it should be possible to create a resource that tracks Medicare participants on clinical trials for outcomes such as survival, hospitalizations, and costs. It would also link individual patients and their treating physicians and hospitals with details of the clinical trial.  If this resource proves as successful as hypothesized, it would have immense opportunity for providing population-based information about clinical trials in the U.S., specifically covering questions related to disparities. However, its potential value extends far beyond the study of cancer disparities. The kinds of population-based questions that could be addressed include: What are the institutional and provider characteristics associated with trial enrollment overall and among underrepresented groups? Is the lower enrollment of black and Hispanic patients on cancer trials due to these patients being treated at institutions with limited or no availability of trials? What is the distance from participant home to the nearest available trial site and how does this differ by patient characteristics? These and other pressing research questions are only possible to address if the record linkage is successful and the data quality is adequate. Thus, the purpose of this proposal is to assess the feasibility of creating this linked data resource. In Aim 1, we will create the record linkages and assemble details about the trials, patients, providers, and outcomes. In Aim 2, we will examine carefully the validity of the crucial linkages that define the proposed new resource. In Aim 3, we will generate data to address three exemplar questions regarding disparities, and map out a more exhaustive set of feasible research questions that would shed light on important aspects of the U.S. clinical trials enterprise. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this proposal is to create a national database that will tell us about older adult patients who have participated in clinical trials. This will allow us to answer questions about what kinds of people participate in these trials, where they are treated, what doctors treat them, and the benefits and risks of such participation, which can influence the future of clinical trials research.",Linking population-based data sources to examine health disparities in clinical trial participation and outcomes,9939490,R21CA235154,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Future ', ' Gold ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Hospitals ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Oncology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' United States National Library of Medicine ', ' National Library of Medicine ', ' National Medical Library ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Privatization ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Work ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' data quality ', ' SEER-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ', ' Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results ', ' Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program ', ' SEER Program ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' exhaustion ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Services ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Policy Research ', ' Qualifying ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Medicare claim ', ' population based ', ' NCI National Clinical Trials Network ', ' National Clinical Trials Network ', ' Minority Enrollment ', ' individual patient ', ' oncology clinical trial ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' data resource ', ' insurance claims ', ' clinical trial enrollment ', ' clinical trial participant ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R21,2020,195315,0.07879068814634263

"Enhancing Cancer Care Of Rural Dwellers Through Telehealth and Engagement (ENCORE) The proposed project is submitted in response to RFA-CA-18-026, providing an “IT-enabled, team-based care delivery models … to deliver comprehensive, coordinated, high-quality cancer-related care to rural low-income and/or underserved populations.” There are widening mortality disparities among rural cancer patients, particularly those who live in counties with persistent poverty, making it critical to develop interventions to improve outcomes for these patients. Therefore, the proposed study is based at seven rural hospitals in Tennessee and Mississippi, states with large rural populations encompassing a third and a half of the population, respectively. With barriers at the health system, provider and patient level, multi-level remotely-delivered interventions that enable rural patients and providers to access expertise housed at a comprehensive cancer center hold tremendous promise. Through the proposed study, we will employ a Type 1 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation design, which includes a traditional clinical effectiveness trial along with a process evaluation of the intervention delivery and implementation. Specifically, we will evaluate the 1) clinical effectiveness of a multi-level telehealthbased intervention for rural hospitals consisting of provider-level access to a molecular tumor board and patientlevel access to supportive care; and 2) facilitators and barriers to future larger scale dissemination and implementation of this multilevel intervention, designed to enhance quality of rural cancer care delivery. The intervention consists of non-randomized provider-level access to a tumor board which incorporates disease, patient and molecular tumor characteristics to enhance treatment options, together with randomized patient-level access to a self-management intervention versus attention control. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research will be used to identify barriers and facilitators. These efforts are possible due to existing community partnerships already in place, which will be leveraged to bring comprehensive care available at our cancer center to rural cancer patients and providers through telehealth. To further underscore the importance of our efforts, the Southern United States in which our academic cancer center is based has amongst the highest cancer mortality rates, and is the region of focus for this application. Our short-term goals are to explore means by which to enhance cancer care among rural cancer patients through broadly and remotely sharing expertise available at our cancer center with rural underserved communities in our region. Our long-term goals are to disseminate evidence-based strategies to improve outcomes among rural cancer patients. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT The goal of this proposal is to improve delivery of comprehensive cancer care delivery to rural communities with persistent poverty, where cancer incidence and mortality are high. Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we will test a multi-level telehealth-based intervention that offers oncologists access to a Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center-based molecular tumor board to expand treatment options, and offers their patients a supportive care intervention to help manage cancer therapy. This type of study is needed to develop evidence-based strategies to remotely make comprehensive cancer care available to rural patients residing in counties with persistent poverty to ultimately reduce the disparities in outcomes.",Enhancing Cancer Care Of Rural Dwellers Through Telehealth and Engagement (ENCORE),10165375,R01CA240093,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers

"Enhancing Cancer Care Of Rural Dwellers Through Telehealth and Engagement (ENCORE) The proposed project is submitted in response to RFA-CA-18-026, providing an “IT-enabled, team-based care delivery models … to deliver comprehensive, coordinated, high-quality cancer-related care to rural low-income and/or underserved populations.” There are widening mortality disparities among rural cancer patients, particularly those who live in counties with persistent poverty, making it critical to develop interventions to improve outcomes for these patients. Therefore, the proposed study is based at seven rural hospitals in Tennessee and Mississippi, states with large rural populations encompassing a third and a half of the population, respectively. With barriers at the health system, provider and patient level, multi-level remotely-delivered interventions that enable rural patients and providers to access expertise housed at a comprehensive cancer center hold tremendous promise. Through the proposed study, we will employ a Type 1 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation design, which includes a traditional clinical effectiveness trial along with a process evaluation of the intervention delivery and implementation. Specifically, we will evaluate the 1) clinical effectiveness of a multi-level telehealthbased intervention for rural hospitals consisting of provider-level access to a molecular tumor board and patientlevel access to supportive care; and 2) facilitators and barriers to future larger scale dissemination and implementation of this multilevel intervention, designed to enhance quality of rural cancer care delivery. The intervention consists of non-randomized provider-level access to a tumor board which incorporates disease, patient and molecular tumor characteristics to enhance treatment options, together with randomized patient-level access to a self-management intervention versus attention control. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research will be used to identify barriers and facilitators. These efforts are possible due to existing community partnerships already in place, which will be leveraged to bring comprehensive care available at our cancer center to rural cancer patients and providers through telehealth. To further underscore the importance of our efforts, the Southern United States in which our academic cancer center is based has amongst the highest cancer mortality rates, and is the region of focus for this application. Our short-term goals are to explore means by which to enhance cancer care among rural cancer patients through broadly and remotely sharing expertise available at our cancer center with rural underserved communities in our region. Our long-term goals are to disseminate evidence-based strategies to improve outcomes among rural cancer patients. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT The goal of this proposal is to improve delivery of comprehensive cancer care delivery to rural communities with persistent poverty, where cancer incidence and mortality are high. Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we will test a multi-level telehealth-based intervention that offers oncologists access to a Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center-based molecular tumor board to expand treatment options, and offers their patients a supportive care intervention to help manage cancer therapy. This type of study is needed to develop evidence-based strategies to remotely make comprehensive cancer care available to rural patients residing in counties with persistent poverty to ultimately reduce the disparities in outcomes.",Enhancing Cancer Care Of Rural Dwellers Through Telehealth and Engagement (ENCORE),9986714,R01CA240093,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers

"Sanford Community Cancer Program of the North Central Plains (NCORP) PROJECT SUMMARY The Sanford Community Cancer Program (SCCP) remains committed to its original goals and aims as stated in our 2013 application. The SCCP continues to increase patient participation in cancer control, prevention, care delivery, treatment, and imaging studies across its expanding network. The rural communities of the upper Midwest and Central Plains represent a large underserved population for cancer treatment, care delivery and clinical trials (PMID:24097196 PMID:22046848 PMID:19621978). The reasons for this disparity are multi- factorial but a main obstacle is access to services in rural regional areas. Sanford Health has developed a network of hospitals, cancer centers and clinics to provide high-quality, multi-disciplinary cancer treatment, clinical trials, and cancer care delivery to this underserved area. Sanford Health has designated cancer care as a Center of Excellence; elevating cancer care as a top priority to the patients it serves. The SCCP has expanded from five to seven components in the past five years, adding two new components to improve trial access in rural and underserved areas. It is hypothesized that this disparity in care for this rural population can be improved by utilizing the organized SCCP network community. This proposal describes how the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) partnership will help deliver clinical care and offer clinical trials across the rural area served by the SCCP. This will be accomplished through the following aims:  1. Maintain and enhance robust accrual to NCI Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) supported  clinical trials through seven components.  2. Address disparities in clinical trial accrual in underserved and underrepresented populations to  increase participation.  3. Cultivate innovative access points to address barriers to clinical trial accrual through outreach  and telemedicine.  4. Expand Cancer Care Delivery Research infrastructure. Through these four aims the Sanford Community Cancer Program will continue to offer NCI clinical trials and provide state-of-the-art cancer treatment and cancer care delivery to millions of people across six states in rural America. The SCCP's ability to provide clinical trials through outreach and telemedicine to this underserved rural population of patients increases their opportunity for participation in a trial as a treatment option. Telemedicine services are currently provided in existing Sanford Clinics in rural communities to deliver oncology consultations, surveillance exams and chemotherapy oversight. As a community based health care organization, the SCCP will participate in the development and implementation of cancer care delivery research to better understand and improve patient outcomes. The SCCP will design and develop additional community based investigator-initiated Cancer Care Delivery pilot projects with the goal to collaborate with the SCCP's primary Research Bases.

"Columbus NCORP RFA-CA-18-016 Since its founding in 1983, the Columbus CCOP, now known as the Columbus NCORP, has been dedicated to providing high quality cancer care options in Central and Southeast Ohio as well as advancing cancer research through cancer research trials. The Columbus NCORP has grown in that time to encompass 20 affiliates and sub-affiliates, with 100 doctors serving as investigators. The NCORP serves a wide variety of populations, from urban areas to rural Appalachia. Over the six years comprising the next grant period, the NCORP plans to continue to grow in that capacity, improving its ability to participate in, assist with the design of, and successfully implement a wide range of cancer research trials, including treatment, cancer control, screening/surveillance, side effect prevention/management, and cancer care delivery research studies. In all areas the NCORP has been successful and plans to continue to grow in its ability to investigate health disparities in its region and increase participation in cancer research by underserved communities including minority populations, rural communities and those in Appalachian areas. Cancer care delivery research has been and continues to be a key component of this goal, as is continuing to improve care practices throughout the consortium. Close collaboration between NCORP affiliate institutions, non-oncology specialists, primary care physicians and community organizations is key to this goal. The Columbus NCORP plans to continue to pursue the cutting edge of cancer research through targeted and genomic therapies, while simultaneously seeking out and implementing trials that are directly applicable to those cancers with the highest incidence rate in our region: breast, colon and lung cancers. Over the past five years as an NCORP, and over the preceding 30 years as the Columbus CCOP, these areas have been a high priority and will continue to be as we aggressively pursue treatments that will advance the science of cancer care and best serve our local communities. The unique challenges facing Central and Southeast Ohio in these areas position the Columbus NCORP to make real and lasting contributions to cancer research, and the lessons learned here are widely applicable to regions across the country. The Columbus Community Clinical Oncology Program has been serving Central Ohio for 35 years and has been participating in the NCI Community Oncology Research Program since its inception. During that time, the Columbus CCOP has excelled in delivering cancer care and access to clinical studies to a wide variety of populations – from major urban areas to rural Appalachia.

"The Pacific Cancer Research Consortium (PCRC), an NCORP Community Site PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In 2013, the Pacific Cancer Research Consortium (PCRC) was created to bring clinical trials and cancer care delivery research to community cancer treatment centers in the Western United States as an NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Community Site. Under a multiple PI/PD structure, the 3 primary component sites—Swedish Cancer Institute in Seattle, Providence Portland Medical Center in Portland, and Mountain States Tumor Institute in Boise—have facilitated the conduct of NCORP-sponsored trials at more than 40 affiliate sites in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and California. Over the past 5 years, the PCRC built on its collective experience in clinical research, its shared organizational structure, and its diverse community demographics to achieve the research and accrual goals of the initial round of funding. As an established NCORP Community Site, for the next round of funding, the PCRC will continue to “bring cancer clinical research studies to individuals in their own communities” by (1) developing clinically important trials and achieving robust accruals that focus on underrepresented populations, (2) participating in cancer treatment, cancer control and prevention, cancer care delivery research, screening, and imaging trials proposed by the NCORP Research Bases, (3) optimizing and streamlining procedures to ensure timely and accurate data submission and specimen collection, (4) enhancing the participation of minorities and underserved populations by involving patient advocates, and (5) mentoring the next generation of community-based cancer clinical trialists. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The NCORP Community Site outlined in this continuation application comes from our experience building a multicenter infrastructure in the Western United States that excels in patient accrual and fosters new and close collaboration between investigators. We believe that our structure will accelerate the translation of knowledge gained from trials in cancer treatment, cancer control and prevention, cancer care delivery research, screening, and imaging into clinical practice and thereby enhance the science, the treatments, and the delivery of care to patients with cancer in community settings.","The Pacific Cancer Research Consortium (PCRC), an NCORP Community Site",9993366,UG1CA189953,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Alaska ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Credentialing ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Idaho ', ' Institutes ', ' Mentors ', ' Montana ', ' Oregon ', ' Patients ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' Agreement ', ' research study ', ' Organization Charts ', ' organizational structure ', ' Prevention ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Improve Access ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Collection ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Oncology ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' treatment center ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' next generation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' demographics ', ' tumor ', ' knowledge translation ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' screening ', ' trial design ', ' Minority Participation ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' feasibility trial ', ' data deposition ', ' data submission ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,"SWEDISH MEDICAL CENTER, FIRST HILL",UG1,2020,2443725,0.07844303193250561
"Medical University of South Carolina NCORP Minority/Underserved Community Site PROJECT SUMMARY The Medical University of South Carolina/Hollings Cancer Center (MUSC/HCC) was established as a Minority Underserved site in 2014 to expand and enhance the NCORP trial portfolio by accruing racially/ethnically diverse patients and those from other medically underserved groups into NCORP studies, share expertise and experience on minority recruitment and retention and cultural diversity within the NCORP community, and contribute to the development and implementation of cancer care and cancer delivery research. During the current project period, the MUSC NCORP-MU, which is comprised of two MUSC/HCC sub-affiliates and five community oncology primary affiliates, has made significant contributions to the NCORP program through the effective and efficient accrual of diverse patient populations and leadership that has shaped the scientific agenda for clinical trials, cancer health disparities, and cancer care delivery research. These accomplishments were made possible through a highly invested and transdisciplinary investigative team consisting of Chanita Hughes-Halbert, PhD (Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences), Marvella E. Ford, PhD (Public Health Sciences), Carolyn D. Britten, MD (Medical Oncology), and David T. Marshall, MD (Radiation Oncology) that has worked hand-in- hand with the clinical research operational leaders at the MUSC/HCC to establish and manage a robust clinical research operation to add value to NCORP.

"Georgia NCI Community Oncology Research Program (GA NCORP) Project Summary This renewal application is for the statewide Georgia National Cancer Institute (NCI) Community Oncology Research Program (GA NCORP) Community Site, which represents a collaboration between the two largest community oncology clinical trial programs in Georgia, Northside Hospital Cancer Institute in Atlanta and the Nancy N. and J.C. Lewis Cancer & Research Pavilion at St. Joseph's/Candler in Savannah, and the Georgia Center for Oncology Research and Education (Georgia CORE) in Atlanta. Georgia CORE provides network affiliation for five contracted healthcare organizations across Georgia. In 2016, GA NCORP Affiliates together provided care to approximately 17,000 newly diagnosed patients with cancer and enrolled 1,198 patients to NCI-sponsored trials since August 2014. Through an integrated organizational and leadership structure, leading cancer researchers of GA NCORP are poised to build on a 29-year history of collaboration to further enhance the quality of cancer care in Georgia through improved access to NCI-sponsored trials and through the implementation of the goals of GA NCORP. The overall goal of GA NCORP is to bring cancer clinical research studies to individuals in their own communities through a statewide network utilizing shared infrastructure. This approach generates a broadly applicable evidence base that contributes to improved patient outcomes and a reduction in cancer disparities. Four specific aims are proposed to achieve the overall goal of GA NCORP: 1) to increase the number of eligible patients at risk for, or diagnosed with, cancer and who are provided access to, and enroll in, cancer clinical trials within their community; 2) to enroll participants from underrepresented populations across all study types and settings to reduce cancer disparities (populations include racial/ethnic minorities, sexual and gender minorities, adolescents, young adults, elderly, and rural residents); 3) to create a balanced trial portfolio between treatment trials and cancer control and prevention trials; and 4) to increase accrual and expand network-wide participation in cancer care delivery research. Achieving these aims will improve the quality of care in Georgia through increasing cancer research in local communities, identifying best practices for research accruals, and maximizing capacity and expertise for cancer research statewide. Project Narrative GA NCORP Community Site addresses two important challenges in US public health: expanding cancer research to a broader population and including underserved populations in cancer research. Advances in clinical care and scientific discovery are not currently equally available to all races and ethnic groups.

"Wisconsin NCI Community Oncology Research Program (WiNCORP) PROJECT SUMMARY The Wisconsin NCORP (WiNCORP) is a consortium of three established healthcare systems in the state of Wisconsin with a long-standing history of excellence in oncology care – Marshfield Clinic Health System, Gundersen Health System, and ThedaCare. Through a network of hospitals, clinics, and other facilities spanning most of the state of Wisconsin, upper Michigan and adjacent counties in Northern Iowa and Southeastern Minnesota, WiNCORP institutions collectively provide care and access to oncology clinical trials to a predominantly rural population. Member sites participate in numerous NCI-sponsored clinical trials and are active in NCORP research base committees, NCI task forces and steering committees, research networks, and organizations with a focus on improving cancer care. Investigators from each system are consistently recognized by the NCI and/or the research bases for their accrual totals, and WiNCORP has been designated as a high-performing site over the previous grant cycle. Through the work of multidisciplinary care teams and research staff, WiNCORP will continue to leverage its collective expertise to open numerous cancer care delivery research (CCDR) trials. With a shared mission to provide patient access to NCI-sponsored clinical trials, WiNCORP members are well-positioned to increase patient accruals from historically underrepresented populations in clinical trials such as rural, elderly, and low-income individuals, enhance cancer care delivery, and reduce disparities in cancer burden across the region. To achieve this goal, WiNCORP leadership has outlined four specific aims for the consortium: 1) Conduct NCI Phase I/II, II and III cancer screening, prevention, symptom management, treatment, post-treatment, imaging and quality of life trials across the entire WiNCORP service area. 2) Facilitate conduct of Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) across our integrated health care systems through establishment of an expanded research infrastructure. 3) Facilitate accrual to molecular target driven trials. 4) Incorporate a new patient population and provider group in the WiNCORP consortium that currently has no access to CCDR studies. These specific aims will be accomplished by expanding communication channels between patients and WiNCORP members, streamlining the process of site opening for various clinical trials, enhancing resource sharing among member sites, enhancing community engagement in clinical trial participation, and continual enhancements and developments in infrastructure and personnel to open and accrue patients to a variety of clinical trial types. It is anticipated that WiNCORP-wide efforts in staff education, clinical trial feasibility assessment, harmonized internal processes, synchronized regulatory support, development of system and trial-specific standard operating procedures, and collaboration among investigators from the three consortium sites will create a synergy that will further enhance clinical trial conduct, efficiency, and quality. PROJECT NARRATIVE WiNCORP represents a collaborative effort among three healthcare systems that provide oncology care to a predominantly rural population in Wisconsin, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Northeastern Iowa, and Southeastern Minnesota. Member sites have developed multidisciplinary care teams and research staff to accrue numerous patients to NCI-sponsored trials and encourage collaboration through participation in regional research networks and affiliations with academic medical centers.

"South Dakota Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (SoDakPCTN) SoDakPCTN Project Summary / Abstract  The purpose of the South Dakota Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (SoDakPCTN) is to leverage the enthusiasm and growth in pediatric research over the last decade to build capacity and skills in clinical trials. This momentum was developed through active collaborations over the past two decades in community-based research with tribal nations, health clinics and hospitals to help improve the health of children in South Dakota. While South Dakota has been a regional leader in large scale longitudinal multi-site observational studies (e.g., Safe Passage Study, ECHO pediatric cohort), opportunities to participate in pediatric clinical research have been limited. SoDakPCTN will be housed within the Avera Health system, a large health system comprised of 300 locations in 100 communities throughout South Dakota and areas of the four surrounding states. The Avera Health system includes 35 hospitals and 34 community and critical access hospitals. The Avera health system and partners are ideally suited to conduct high quality pediatric clinical trials that specifically reach rural, frontier, and American Indian (AI) populations across South Dakota. The Center for Pediatric and Community Research (CPCR) at Avera has worked to establish a robust pediatric research infrastructure that allows for large - scale longitudinal studies that already occur within clinics, hospitals and communities across the state, with offices in Sioux Falls, Rapid City and Pine Ridge.  SoDakPCTN will be built around three specific aims. First, build upon existing pediatric research infrastructure to create a collaborative environment that supports state -of-the-art pediatric clinical trials in inpatient, outpatient, and community-based settings. Second, support career development for junior investigators and research staff in conducting pediatric clinical trials through mentorship, professional development opportunities, and introduction to potential hospital, clinic, and community partners. Third, using a community engaged approach, develop research dissemination strategies and translate research findings to clinical and community stakeholders to improve knowledge and practice.

"ECOG-ACRIN NCORP Research Base Project Summary The ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (EA) is dedicated to decreasing the burden of cancer. EA is a vibrant member of the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), focused on practice-changing clinical and translational research across the cancer care continuum from prevention and early detection, through the management of advanced disease and its impact. As an NCORP Research Base, EA has engaged community providers and researchers to develop a robust research portfolio that spans Cancer Prevention, Cancer Control, and Cancer Care Delivery, aligned with the overall scientific themes of precision oncology, immuno-oncology, reducing overdiagnosis and overtreatment, and leveraging novel biomarker platforms. Cancer control trials examine and intervene on challenges associated with cancer and treatment-related symptoms and concerns. EA's portfolio of therapeutic trials yield opportunities to apply patient-reported outcomes measurement science to quantify health-related quality of life, symptoms, and domains most relevant to patients in the context of evolving treatment paradigms. Behavioral and biomarker-driven symptom interventions aim to improve quality of life and cancer survivorship. Cardiotoxicity research aims to mitigate risk through quantifying cardiotoxicity associated with treatment, identifying groups at risk, and advancing interventions to reduce risk. Prevention trials embrace the NCI's broad definition of prevention to include primary prevention, cancer screening, and secondary prevention and aim to identify high risk groups for precision prevention strategies. Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) examines the complex interactions between patient, provider, and system factors that influence care, and adapts and evaluates interventions in heterogenous community oncology practices. Health equity research permeates EA science through embedding disparities-related research questions that span EA activities, adopting a broad view of underserved populations including adolescents and young adults, the elderly, racial and ethnic minorities, sexual and gender minorities and rural residents. Key collaborations with community-based oncology programs will ensure access to EA NCTN and NCORP trials in communities where patients receive their care. EA provides access to existing NCI-funded resources and a network of >10000 physicians, scientists, nurses, research associates (RAs), statisticians, biomedical information technologists, and patient advocates across approximately 600 institutions and organizations. EA has provided scientific leadership in the NCORP community through advancing rigorous, practice-changing clinical trials and translational research in cancer control, prevention and care delivery and is well poised to continue to support the NCI's mission to engage community-based diverse populations in cancer research.

"A multi-level mixed methods examination of treatment non-adherence among rural oncology patients Project Summary. The nearly 3 million US cancer survivors residing in rural areas experience 10% higher cancer mortality compared to their urban counterparts, in part due to poorer cancer treatment adherence. Reasons for rural-urban disparities in cancer treatment adherence are not fully understood. The majority of research to-date has focused on health claims data and small-sample survey data. Moreover, extant data has often neglected the protective and enabling factors that are characteristic of rural communities. A deeper understanding of factors driving cancer treatment non-adherence in rural populations is necessary to design targeted, asset-based interventions to reduce rural health disparities and improve outcomes. The premise of the proposed research is that multi-level factors contribute to the observed rural-urban differences in cancer treatment adherence and outcomes, including sociodemographic inequities and diminished access to healthcare, psychosocial services, and technological advances. Rural cultural factors serve as barriers and facilitators to treatment adherence and may be positively impacted by digitally-mediated interventions. The purpose of the proposed research is to elucidate social and behavioral factors encompassing rural culture as it relates to oncology treatment non-adherence and delineate factors amenable to targeted, tailored approaches to improve rural oncology outcomes. These goals will be accomplished by a rigorous mixed methods approach utilizing population-based surveys, semi-structured interviews, and ecological momentary assessment, supported by community engagement across study phases to capitalize on strengths of rural culture while minimizing barriers. A highly qualified multi-disciplinary team has been assembled to support my research and training goals in mixed methodology and rural community engagement. The proposed F99/K00 application targets the NCI's emerging priority of rural cancer control and aligns with current NCI funding initiatives in rural oncology and implementation science. Completion of this unique pre to post-doctoral fellowship transition award will provide me with the skills and experience necessary to be a highly trained cancer control researcher with specific expertise in 1) rural populations, 2) health disparities, 3) patterns of care, and 4) care coordination and delivery - four of the seven NCI Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences areas of research emphasis, thus expertly preparing me to advance the field of rural cancer control through the development of innovative and scalable interventions addressing the self-management support needs of this underserved population.

"A Lead Academic Participating Site in Oklahoma for the Design and Conduct of NCTN Clinical Trials Abstract The Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC) at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) plays a crucial role in providing Oklahomans with access to National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and other clinical trials, thereby helping to raise the standard of care in the State and region. At the national level, the SCC has provided significant leadership in the design and conduct of NCTN clinical trials. In 2014, the SCC was designated a Lead Academic Participating Site (LAPS) in the NCTN. Since that time, it has worked to advance the following Specific Aims: (1) providing scientific leadership and coordination with NCTN components to design and conduct NCTN clinical trials for newly developed therapies, including multi-modality treatments, combinations of novel agents, molecularly based treatments, Precision Medicine screening, and advanced imaging approaches; (2) effectively integrating scientific expertise and clinical trials management capabilities at the SCC in order to activate, conduct and complete NCTN clinical trials in an efficient, timely and compliant manner; and (3) accomplishing Aims 1 and 2 within the context of providing high-quality cancer care and access to NCTN clinical trials for all Oklahomans, with a special emphasis on the State's underserved populations which experience disproportionately high rates of cancer health disparities. To advance Aim 3, the SCC utilizes patient navigators, social workers and targeted educational information to address barriers to enrolling patients on NCTN and other clinical trials. Specifically, the SCC has implemented an innovative American Indian (AI) Patient Navigation program to serve the Oklahoma's large AI population and promote enrollment to NCTN and other clinical trials for this population under-represented in clinical research. Clinical research activities at the SCC are overseen by a well-defined governance structure and supported by a centralized Clinical Trials Office (CTO) that manages regulatory, data management, study coordination, informatics, quality assurance, and biospecimen acquisition for all cancer clinical trials. The CTO functions as a core resource and receives funding from a variety of sources in addition to clinical trial direct cost dollars, allowing it to be proactive in faculty and staff education and career development, and leading to enhanced expertise and support capabilities. The collective knowledge base and cross-training within the CTO allows for adequate staffing and knowledge at all levels of research activity and ensures a coordinated research team approach for clinical research. The SCC is a Main Voting Member for NRG Oncology and the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, and it is a Full Member of SWOG and ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group. It has worked efficiently and expeditiously with the respective Network Group operations, data management, and statistical centers to accomplish the Specific Aims of the grant. Relevance Statement This proposal is directly relevant to public health. As a Lead Academic Participating Site in the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN), the Stephenson Cancer Center will directly contribute to the design and conduct of NCTN clinical trials for newly developed therapies, including multi-modality treatments, combinations of novel agents, Precision Medicine screening, and advanced imaging approaches.

"Cancer Center Support Grant P30 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCDCCC), a consortium with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL), is a matrix organization under the aegis of the UC Davis Health System and University of California, Davis. Two hundred and four members are organized into six programs, supported by eight shared resources, and led by Senior Leadership in order to use transdisciplinary, translational, and transformative research to address the following problems: With a rapidly aging population, 40 million Americans over the age of 65 are alive today and 390,000 will die from cancer this year. In 15 years, approximately, 74 million Americans of this age will be alive and cancer mortality will be ~730,000/year. The present methods by which new cancer therapies have been developed have met with a disappointing failure rate; therefore, improved translational methods are needed. So too are integrated programs that combine physical sciences, biomedical technology, and functional imaging to develop new therapies and delivery modalities as well as methods for functional evaluation and enhanced detection to determine, in a non-toxic fashion, if therapies will work. Two main foci are used to address these problems:  1) Reducing disparities in the cancer burden  2) Tackling advanced cancer by adapting molecularly targeted therapy through our patient derived  xenograft program (PDX) and canine patients to truly develop personalized medicine. Each of these uses a multi-disciplinary approach, combining expertise from across programs (Molecular Oncology, Comparative Oncology, Cancer Therapeutics, Population Sciences and Health Disparities, Prostate Urothelial Cancer, and Biomedical Technology), leveraging the UC Davis expertise (e.g., School of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Biological Sciences, Department of Biomedical Technology), and with external partners (the Jackson Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Foundation Medicine). Seven Innovation Groups enhance collaborative interactions and proposals with focus on translating basic and technological findings into grants and investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Beyond that, the UCDCCC’s robust clinical trials program enables these discoveries to be translated into patient benefits. The portfolio consist of NCI awards to fund Phase I, II, and III trials, COG and NCI Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium trials, and a strong portfolio of IITs. These are implemented by a cadre of clinical scientists (11 of whom were recruited in the past funding period) who function as the interface of translational and clinical research. The catchment area (13 counties surrounding Sacramento county) is benefited through, among other activities, a city-wide early phase clinical trials program and the UCDCCC Cancer Care Network, through which the resources and expertise of a comprehensive cancer center are brought to disadvantaged and rural areas while keeping patients in their home communities. Finally, in this world of ever-changing cancer care delivery models, combined with an increasing numbers of patients seeking help and increasing complexities of treatments available, we are building a robust cancer supportive/psycho oncology program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer and its effects are an ever-increasing problem at the population and individual levels. The UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center's research is aimed at reducing this burden through cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment that is truly precision and personalized. Unique research strategies include the use of patient-derived xenografts, canine clinical trials, and state-of-the-art imaging, all of which is focused on translating discoveries into innovative clinical trials that ultimately improve the lives of patients and families with cancer.",Cancer Center Support Grant P30,10063282,P30CA093373,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Canine Species ', ' Dogs ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' canine ', ' domestic dog ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Patients ', ' physical science ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Veterinary Schools ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Talents ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Veterinary Medicine ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Generations ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Heterograft ', ' Heterologous Transplantation ', ' Xenograft ', ' Xenotransplantation ', ' xeno-transplant ', ' xeno-transplantation ', ' Xenograft procedure ', ' Transcend ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' molecular oncology ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' member ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' Modality ', ' Biomedical Technology ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Genomic Stability ', ' Genome Stability ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Detection ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' CCSG ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' Cancer Grant Supplements ', ' P30 Award ', ' P30 Grant ', ' Cancer Grant Supplements (P30) ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' physiological imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Molecular ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Oncogenic ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' comparative ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' population health ', ' oncology program ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' improved outcome ', ' molecular targeted therapeutics ', ' molecular targeted treatment ', ' molecular targeted therapies ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' recruit ', ' Service model ', ' care delivery model ', ' health care delivery model ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' Service delivery model ', ' oncology trial ', ' investigator-initiated trial ', ' prostate urothelial cancer ', ' early clinical trial ', ' early phase clinical trial ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P30,2020,89478,0.015294446579397119
"SARS-COV-2 Environmental Constraint Effects on Cancer Prevention and Management Outcomes The Univ. of Colorado Cancer Center (UCCC) will participate in a consortium with other NCI-designated cancer centers to conduct a cross-sectional study within their respective regional catchment area populations. The consortium is led by the Univ. of Alabama (UAB), Birmingham’s O'Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center. The first aim of the consortium is to investigate whether the SARS-COV-2 pandemic has impacted individuals’ behaviors known to be associated with the development or prevention of cancer malignancies such as tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. We are interested in investigating whether constraints due to the pandemic such as social distancing, loss of employment, and mental health challenges have affected individuals’ health behaviors differently due to their age, race/ethnicity, rural/urban residency, or socio-economic status. UCCC will survey 1,500 individuals who experience cancer disparities in our catchment (Colorado), including individuals of Hispanic descent, who live in poverty, and reside in rural or frontier counties. We will use the Univ. of Colo. Health Survey Registry (Registry) to draw a sub-sample of individuals from these populations in Colorado. The Registry is enrolled from respondents to the statewide Tobacco Attitudes and Behavior Survey (TABS) on Health, a crosssectional population survey conducted in Colorado. The second aim of the consortium is to investigate whether constraints associated with the pandemic impacted cancer patients and survivors’ ability to receive cancer treatment, follow-up or surveillance procedures, treatment regimens as prescribed, participation clinical trials, and interventions to manage pain and treatment side-effects. We will investigate if the pandemic impacted these outcomes differently for patients based on differences in their demographic characteristics, type of cancer diagnosed and stage of diagnosis, as well as their treatment status (active treatment, posttreatment survivorship). Moreover, we are also interested in investigating whether the SARS-COV-2 pandemic negatively affected outcomes that are important to cancer patients (patient-centered outcomes) such as their social and emotional functioning, quality of life, coping, social support/connectedness, and financial hardship due to loss of employment or health insurance associated with the pandemic’s constraints. In Colorado, we will leverage our collaboration with UCCC’s Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN)/Total Cancer Care study platform to field a survey to 1,000 cancer patients and survivors who have been previously consented at UCCC to be contacted for research purposes. Constructs measured will be examined using descriptive statistics, with focus on how specific groups differ. Geospatial information will be used to compare area-based measures (e.g., socioeconomic indicators) to individual-level measures. Multilevel modeling will be conducted to understand the relationship between demographic variables and cancer preventive and cancer management outcomes and how the relationship is moderated by the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE The University of Colorado Cancer Center (UCCC) is an NCI-designated matrix consortium of six academic institutions and clinical affiliates encompassing the State of Colorado as its catchment area. Bringing together nearly all NCI-funded investigators in the State, the UCCC has established a multidisciplinary nexus of research excellence in the fight against cancer with a mission to discover, develop, and deliver breakthroughs in cancer science. Skillful management and key recruitments over the past 5 years led to impactful innovations in cancer biology that translated into prevention, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in clinical trials and commercialization. The UCCC also addresses needs of underserved populations by providing targeted, culturally appropriate behavioral interventions, colorectal cancer screenings and shaping state tobacco control legislation. CCSG renewal and new institutional commitments of $65M and 20K sf of space will continue our upward trajectory and enhance our fight against cancer for Colorado and the world.",SARS-COV-2

"Winship National Clinical Trials Network Lead Academic Participating Site Project Summary/Abstract Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University (Winship) is the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in the state of Georgia, despite Georgia being the eighth most populous state in the nation. Within Georgia, cancer is the second leading cause of death, with 48,850 new cancer cases diagnosed each year1. Since March 1, 2014, when Winship became a NCI National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) Lead Academic Participating Site (LAPS), Winship has played a unique role in leading research in the NCTN groups in the four most important measures of success: 1) Winship has exceeded its enrollment target for NCTN trials; 2) Winship has provided significant leadership to both the NRG and the ECOG-ACRIN groups; 3) Winship has been active in designing and supporting clinical trials in all NCTN network groups; and 4) Winship leadership has been successful in mentoring the next generation of cancer researchers. Winship members are well represented in the NCI's NCTN steering committees and task forces. Approximately 30% of Winship patients enrolled to NCTN trials are of African descent. Additionally, Winship has been among the top three centers for the past four years and the highest in 2016 to enroll children and adolescents with cancer to the Children's Oncology Group (COG) indicating Winship's leadership in the NCTN. The Atlanta VA Medical Center, currently an affiliate of our LAPS, was the top enroller to NCTN trials nationally among VA hospitals for the first two years of the award period. Winship has also leveraged its statewide partnerships with the Georgia National Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) and the Georgia minority underserved NCORP to enhance accruals to NCTN trials throughout Georgia. With an enthusiastic institutional commitment to its role in the NCTN, Winship proposes the following specific aims for this application: 1) Expand its many leadership roles within the NCTN and the network groups; 2) Enroll Winship patients onto a wide spectrum of NCTN trials, emphasizing enrollment of historically under-represented minority patients; 3) Provide mentorship and guidance to early career investigators for participation in the NCTN; and 4) Develop novel clinical trials in the NCTN based on research ideas generated at Winship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University has made outstanding contributions to the NCTN in multiple ways, including providing scientific leadership, service to the network groups, robust patient enrollment, participation in important NCI steering committees and task forces, and providing mentorship to the next generation of researchers.

"Improving rural cancer care delivery Project Summary/Abstract Although advances in cancer treatment have improved patient survival overall, cancer mortality rates in rural populations remain disproportionately higher than urban populations. Rural-urban disparities in cancer mortality rates are thought to, in part, reflect suboptimal care coordination in rural areas. Cancer patients residing in rural areas experience greater care coordination challenges including limited or lack of access to medical care, travel burdens, shortages of specialists, and delays in receiving diagnosis and post-diagnosis intervention. Delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation have been shown to adversely impact patient survival; such delays have been associated with a three-fold cancer mortality risk. However, little is known about rural cancer patients’ perception of care coordination, rural-urban differences in specific cancer care coordination processes, and the impact of rural cancer care coordination on specific care delivery outcomes. The proposed research will address these knowledge gaps and accomplish the following aims: Aim 1) To compare rural and urban cancer patients’ perception of care coordination and Aim 2) To examine the associations between rural cancer patients’ perception of care coordination and specific care delivery outcomes (time from first symptoms to diagnosis, time from diagnosis to treatment initiation). These aims will inform specific care coordination processes that disproportionately impact rural cancer patients and ways to improve rural cancer care delivery. Findings will guide the development of future interventions focused on improving rural cancer care delivery and may contribute to improved quality and value of cancer care, reduce burdens related to care delivery for rural cancer patients, and address rural cancer health disparities. The proposed research advances the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)’s focus on research and evaluation of health care delivery in a priority population residing in rural areas. The proposed fellowship is designed to enhance the applicant’s knowledge and skills in health services research under expert mentorship and a mentoring committee, and includes a larger training plan developed to prepare the applicant for the next step in her career toward becoming an independent investigator. Training and research will be conducted at one of the 70 National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers. Upon completion of the proposed research and training, the applicant will be ideally poised to submit a complete K01 application focused on developing and testing an intervention aimed to improve cancer care coordination in rural areas. Her current and future research aims will advance AHRQ’s mission by focusing on the delivery of health care in a high priority population residing in rural areas. This proposed research is relevant to public health as improving rural cancer care coordination results in better quality and value of care, reduced burdens of cancer, and lower cancer mortality rates specifically in rural areas. To effectively identify specific targets for improvement in cancer care coordination in rural areas, evaluation of rural cancer patients’ perceptions of care coordination is needed. Results will advance patient- centered cancer care delivery research and understanding of rural cancer care coordination to reduce health disparities in rural areas and improve health care delivery in a high priority population residing in rural areas.",Improving rural cancer care delivery,10069261,F32HS027286,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,F32,2020,65310,0.07014296092579603

"MINORITY-BASED COMMUNITY ONCOLOGY PROGRAM The overall goals of the Montefiore-Einstein minority-based NCORP community site are to advance the diagnosis, prevention, and management of early and advanced cancer by participating in NCORP trials as a minority/underserved community site, and contributing scientifically and administratively to the NCORP research bases. This will be accomplished by leveraging the strengths of the Montefiore Health System (MHS), including Montefiore Medical Center (MMC), which brings strengths in integrated patient care and innovative health care delivery systems in an academic medical center serving a largely minority population, and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Cancer Center (Einstein), which brings strength in training and education, and in baslc, translational, and clinical research through its NCI- designated cancer center. The MMC-Einstein program also brings critical leadership to the NCORP Research Bases, including ECOG-ACRIN, Alliance, and NRG, including leadership roles at the level of the group chair's office, scientific committee chair (or co-chair), and protocol chair (or co-chair). Our plans build upon our long-standing involvement in all aspects of cancer research as a main member of ECOG for 45 years and an NCI-designated cancer center for 48 years, and a strong history of minority accrual to cancer treatment trials (about 65%of all patients). MMC serves the Bronx, an urban community of 1.47 million residents, of whom 89% are minorities and 29% live below the federal poverty level. In the prior funding period we had a strong track record scientific contributions to the NCORP research bases, and met our accrual targets with exceptionally strong minority participation. In the next funding period, we will continue our strong leadership in cancer therapeutics (EA2165), expand the spectrum of our activities to include new programs in cancer imaging and screening (TMIST), cancer control/prevention (EAZ171), and cancer care delivery research (CCDR). The MMC-Einstein NCORP program is led by faculty with experience in cancer therapeutics and biomarker research (J. Sparano, MD), precision medicine and immunoncology (B. Halmos, MD), and CCDR and cancer prevention/control (B. Rapkin, PhD), and is supported by a cadre of other investigators with a broad range of expertise, some of whom benefited from NCI- funded K12 training program in clinical cancer research. The goal of the Montefiore-Einstein Minority/Underserved National Community Oncology Research Program (MU NCORP) is to advance the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management of early and advanced cancer. Our goals are to: 1) accrue at least 80 subjects to trials sponsored by the NCORP research bases (including at least 40 to therapeutic trials), 2) provide scientific and administrative leadership to the ECOG-ACRIN, NRG and Alliance research bases; 3) expand our capacity for cancer care delivery research (CCDR) to include at least 3 active CCDR protocols; 4) train and mentor young investigators in all areas of NCORP research; and 5) contribute expertise in novel methodology to address cancer health disparities, including patient engagement, trial design and outcomes measurement.",MINORITY-BASED COMMUNITY ONCOLOGY PROGRAM,9998867,UG1CA189859,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Black race ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Language ', ' Leadership ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' New York ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Training Programs ', ' Training Support ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' taxane ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Anus Carcinoma ', ' Anal carcinoma ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Hematopoietic Cell Tumor ', ' Hematopoietic Malignancies ', ' Hematopoietic Neoplasms including Lymphomas ', ' Hematopoietic Tumor ', ' Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Cell Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Hematopoietic Neoplasm ', ' blood cancer ', ' Hematopoietic Neoplasms ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' neuropathic ', ' Neuropathy ', ' System ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Medical center ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' post-graduate education ', ' postgraduate education ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' Committee Members ', ' Institution ', ' K12 ', ' SECTM1 ', ' Secreted and Transmembrane 1 ', ' SECTM1 gene ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adjuvant Trials ', ' adjuvant protocol ', ' Adjuvant Study ', ' AECC ', ' Albert Einstein Cancer Center ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' ECOG ', ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' ACRIN ', ' American College of Radiology Imaging Network ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Oncology ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Adjuvant ', ' treatment trial ', ' health related quality of life ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' cancer imaging ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' federal poverty level ', ' minority subjects ', ' population based ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' oncology program ', ' screening ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' Therapeutic Trials ', ' trial design ', ' Minority Participation ', ' institutional capacity ', ' oncology clinical trial ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' underserved minority ', ' patient engagement ', ' marker validation ', ' biomarker validation ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Opdivo ', ' Nivolumab ', ' financial toxicity ', ' ']",NCI,"MONTEFIORE MEDICAL CENTER (BRONX, NY)",UG1,2020,1180289,0.0037436940613637796
"Addressing Cancer-Related Financial Toxicity In Rural Oncology Care Settings PROJECT SUMMARY & ABSTRACT Financial toxicity (FT), a term used to describe the high cost and cost-related psychosocial burden that cancer care places on patients and their families, is a major and underappreciated problem affecting at least 20% of all cancer patients, with potentially devastating effects on outcomes. FT disproportionately affects patients in rural settings due to multiple socioeconomic, access, and clinical factors. A recent review of cancer-related financial hardship characterized the burden of FT as belonging to one of three domains: (1) material hardship, including high out-of-pocket expenses and lost wages; (2) psychological burden from distress and anxiety caused by high cancer costs; and (3) behavioral changes resulting from high cancer care costs, including changes in both medical and non-medical spending. Across cancer sites and stages, the considerable material hardship caused by cancer has been linked consistently to negative psychological and behavioral outcomes, including lower health-related quality of life, higher emotional distress, treatment delay/discontinuation, and filing for bankruptcy. Importantly, FT is also associated with increased mortality. Harmful psychological effects and care-altering behavioral responses, such as delaying or foregoing treatment, are more common in rural patients who also face considerable geographic barriers to care and greater financial vulnerability (e.g., lack of health insurance), likely contributing to widely-observed rural/urban disparities in cancer mortality. Interventions are urgently needed to prevent and mitigate high FT for cancer patients living in rural areas. Our prior work with patients, cancer care professionals, and a regional network of rural oncology practices argues strongly for intervening with financial navigation (FN), due to the complex material, structural, and psychological needs in this setting, fragmentation of existing financial support resources, and complicated assistance eligibility requirements. FN is one type of evidence-based intervention implemented at the practice or system level that can identify patients at high risk for FT, assess eligibility for existing federal, nonprofit, manufacturer, and local financial support resources, clarify treatment cost expectations, and develop strategies to cope with high costs of care. Our long-term goal is to improve cancer care delivery, reduce FT, and improve outcomes in underserved, rural populations through sustainable, scalable interventions. The objectives of this application are to: (1) understand the rural oncology practice context to optimize tailored strategies to support FN implementation; (2) assess FN intervention implementation in rural oncology practices; and (3) evaluate the effects of FN implementation on patient outcomes, including FT and health-related quality of life, in rural oncology practices. Our proposal is directly responsive to RFA-CA-18-026, which seeks to “improve the reach and quality of cancer care in rural populations”. Expected outcomes are the development and refinement of the operational and logistical processes needed to deliver effective FN in rural settings and reduction in FT, with potential to reduce rural outcome disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The financial toxicity (FT) of cancer care is a serious and growing problem, particularly for rural patients, who face disproportionate hardship due to multiple socioeconomic, access, and clinical factors; as a result, interventions are urgently needed to address FT among rural patients, who experience higher cancer-related morbidity and mortality than their non-rural counterparts, due, in part, to financially-motivated, care-altering behaviors, such as delaying or skipping life-prolonging treatments. The sustainability of interventions such as evidence-based financial navigation (FN) to prevent and mitigate FT in rural settings requires an understanding of: (1) the rural oncology practice context to guide the tailoring of strategies to support FN implementation, (2) the process of implementation in rural oncology practices, and (3) whether FN implementation in rural settings leads to improvement in FT and other patient-reported outcomes, such as health-related quality of life. The objective of this application, therefore, is to systematically assess the implementation and effectiveness of a FN intervention delivered in 5 rural oncology practices to 500 patients, with a goal of reducing FT and improving care quality, access, and outcomes in rural cancer patients.",Addressing Cancer-Related Financial Toxicity In Rural Oncology Care Settings,9996627,R01CA240092,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Coping Behavior ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Financial Support ', ' financial assistance ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Interview ', ' Maps ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Shock ', ' Circulatory Collapse ', ' circulatory shock ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Work ', ' Bankruptcy ', ' Financial Insolvency ', ' Rural Community ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Caring ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' Out-of-Pocket Expense ', ' Uncovered Medical Expenses ', ' Uncovered Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' medical expenses not covered by insurance ', ' total medical expenditure ', ' Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' Rural ', ' Logistics ', ' satisfaction ', ' uptake ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' feeling distress ', ' feeling upset ', ' emotional distress ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically underserved population ', ' cancer location ', ' cancer site ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer care ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', "" President's Cancer Panel "", ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Oncology ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' prescription drug costs ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' implementation research ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' arm ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' improved outcome ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' urban disparity ', ' rural patients ', ' rural locality ', ' rural place ', ' rural setting ', ' recruit ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' care costs ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' implementation strategy ', ' rural cancer care ', ' financial toxicity ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' Rural Minority ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,488485,0.07945702553699077
"Montana Cancer Consortium: An Inclusive and Collaborative Approach to Clinical Trial Accrual and Cancer Care Delivery Research across Montana, Idaho and Wyoming PROJECT SUMMARY The Montana Cancer Consortium (MCC) is an independent, nonprofit organization whose mission is to bring state-of-the-art cancer care to Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming through National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored clinical research. MCC coordinates, supports and improves the activities of physicians and other cancer care professionals, cancer centers and hospitals across the service area to maximize patient access to the highest levels of cancer care with a focus on access to clinical trials. In addition, MCC helps to design and influence cancer care delivery research through continued participation that informs and speeds validated care innovations into clinical practice. The region has been characterized as `mega-rural' with limited access to care due to the vastness of the geography, lack of university-based treatment and research facilities, and lack of primary care providers. Montana, Idaho and Wyoming are home to seven, five, and one American Indian Reservations respectively, where issues of poverty, distance, and cultural taboos surrounding cancer care discussion and treatment create unique disparities to prevention, early diagnosis, treatment and survivorship of cancer. The overall goal of MCC is to increase access to clinical trials in the service area while improving the delivery of cancer care through research. This is accomplished through inclusiveness of membership, communication, education, a commitment to quality, and participation in national clinical trial initiatives. The MCC NCORP Community Site consists of 10 primary affiliate sites and nine sub-affiliates that collectively serve nearly two million residents in an area covering over 200,000 square miles. Membership includes 60 oncology investigators representing all cancer care specialty areas. MCC is a member in good standing with the four adult research bases, and is poised to provide and support expanded access to state-of-the-art cancer treatment, control, prevention, screening, surveillance and care delivery through NCI-sponsored clinical trials. Strong leadership, an involved network of member physicians and dedicated affiliate sites strengthens MCC as an NCORP Community Site. PROJECT NARRATIVE Montana Cancer Consortium exists to maximize access to clinical trials and research through centralized services and support for member physicians and affiliate sites that might not otherwise offer access to these critical opportunities. The uniquely rural and medically underserved population of Montana, Northern Idaho and Northern Wyoming offers stimulating challenges for implementing NCI-sponsored clinical trials and care delivery research. The collective experience of the affiliate sites in successful clinical trial enrollment and care delivery research in the vastly rural area will benefit NCORP's diversity and disparity goals.","Montana Cancer Consortium: An Inclusive and Collaborative Approach to Clinical Trial Accrual and Cancer Care Delivery Research across Montana, Idaho and Wyoming",9993364,UG1CA189872,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Health Service Area ', ' Health Catchment Area ', ' Service area ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Cancer Hospital ', ' Idaho ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Montana ', ' Nonprofit Organizations ', ' Non-Profit Organizations ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Taboo ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Wyoming ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' Medical Oncologist ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' research facility ', ' care delivery ', ' Speed ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' American Indian reservation ', ' nation reservation ', ' native american reservation ', ' reservation community ', ' tribal reservation ', ' Indian reservation ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' response ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically underserved population ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' Address ', ' Gynecologic Oncologist ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Radiation Oncologist ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Oncology ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical care ', ' clinical practice ', ' oncology program ', ' screening ', ' collaborative approach ', ' rurality ', ' rural environment ', ' rural Americans ', ' rural resident ', ' rural dwellers ', ' rural underserved ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' clinical trial enrollment ', ' treatment research ', ' ']",NCI,MONTANA CANCER CONSORTIUM,UG1,2020,940023,0.14432159514442464

"The University of Kansas Cancer Center's- MCA Rural NCORP Abstract The overarching goal for The University of Kansas Cancer Center – Midwest Cancer Alliance Rural NCORP (KUCC-MCA Rural NCORP) is to enhance capacity for increasing clinical trials accrual and participation of rural populations in cancer control, prevention, treatment, and care delivery clinical trials, as well as in other human research developed and conducted by NCORP Research Bases. While cancer affects all population groups, certain subgroups, including those living in rural communities, are more at risk than others.[1, 2] Contributing risk factors include older age, inadequate insurance coverage, lower socio-economic status, minority race, and more isolated geography—all of which can be barriers to receiving specialty healthcare. Inaccessibility of clinical trials due to geographical barriers clearly disadvantages rural patients and is their most frequently cited reason for not enrolling in studies.[5] Patients living in suburban areas have the highest accrual rates to clinical trials, while those by patients living in rural areas is quite low[6, 7]. The University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC) is strongly positioned to enhance clinical trial accrual and participation of rural populations through its leadership of the Midwest Cancer Alliance (MCA) and its cadre of accomplished investigators with extensive experience working with rural communities and practices. As the outreach network of the KUCC, the MCA has partnered with hospitals, cancer centers, and health care providers across the state of Kansas for over a decade. The goal of these MCA partnerships has always been to extend the reach of clinical research into under-represented communities, with a focus on rural and low-income communities. MCA recently expanded to include our state-wide rural primary care practice based research network, Kansas Patients and Providers Engaged in Prevention Research (KPPEPR), a network of over 75 primary care providers from across Kansas with a longstanding history of supporting cancer prevention and control research initiatives. KUCC-MCA Rural NCORP will leverage our over 45-year experience as a SWOG-member, 20-year experience providing oncology care via telemedicine, 15-year history of successfully conducting research in rural primary care settings, and 10-year experience opening and running clinical trials within rural health care networks—all supported by KUCC expertise in partnering with rural oncology and primary care practices to accomplish our goals. Specifically for the KUCC-MCA Rural NCORP, we will assess institutional, provider, clinical trial, and patient barriers to trial accrual, and implement processes to: 1) Enhance the infrastructure of local cancer centers and primary care offices to support clinical trials accrual in rural communities; 2) Expand access to clinical trials across the MCA network by offering available NCORP clinical trials in local rural communities; 3) Decrease barriers to clinical trial participation for rural and low-income patients across Kansas and western Missouri by providing trial participation opportunities in their home communities; and 4) Leverage KUCC/MCA expertise for addressing rural cancer disparities to clinical trial participation with NCORP grantees. Project Narrative Cancer affects all populations; certain groups, including those in rural communities, are more at risk than others.[1, 2] Rural patients face disadvantages in accessing specialty care and cite geographic barriers as a frequent reason for not enrolling in studies.[5] The University of Kansas Cancer Center – Midwest Cancer Alliance Rural NCORP (KUCC-MCA Rural NCORP) will decrease barriers, expand access to trials, and enhance infrastructure in the local rural community.",The University of Kansas Cancer Center's- MCA Rural NCORP,9994959,UG1CA239767,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Kansas ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest US ', ' Missouri ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Running ', ' Rural Population ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Rural Community ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' suburban ', ' suburbia ', ' suburb ', ' urban area ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' data quality ', ' Funding ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention Research ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Local Cancer ', ' Localized Cancer ', ' Localized Malignancy ', ' Localized Malignant Neoplasm ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' Population Group ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Oncology ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' SWOG ', ' Southwest Oncology Group ', ' Process ', ' practice-based research network ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' high standard ', ' primary care setting ', ' health equity ', ' underserved minority ', ' rural health care ', ' rural healthcare ', ' rural resident ', ' rural dwellers ', ' rural patients ', ' rural underserved ', ' rural locality ', ' rural place ', ' rural setting ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' patient barriers ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,UG1,2020,1637397,0.05008812582131997

Specifically, UAB was a founding member of the GOG, and has been a member of RTOG, ECOG, ACRIN. CALGB, NSABP, and SWOG. UAB CCC is a current member of the ALLIANCE, ECOG-ACRIN, NRG and SWOG cooperative groups. The UAB NCTN Deep South Research Consortium (DSRC) is currently a Lead Academic Participating Site in the NCI's National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) Program, and now submits this proposal to continue to serve the NCI in this capacity. It is our intention to continue as a leading contributor of scientific leaders and clinical trial participants to the NCTN Program in the U.S. and particularly in the Southeast. To accomplish this overall vision, we propose the following specific aims: 1) To further enhance the involvement of existing UAB CCC scientific leadership in NCTN Cooperative Group related clinical and translational research and to develop the next generation of NCTN Cooperative group scientific leaders within the UAB CCC, and 2) To further refine a clinical trials process within the DSRC that optimizes accrual of potentially eligible cancer patients and patients at risk for cancer to NCTN Cooperative Group clinical trials, and 3) To further increase minority accrual to NCTN Cooperative Group trials. We include in this proposal a detailed description of our DSRC cooperative group scientific and patient accrual contributions and accomplishments, a leadership and organizational structure for our Consortium, and how we intend to utilize existing DSRC infrastructure to achieve our aims. Further, we also include a detailed description of our Junior Investigator Recruitment and Mentoring Program. This proposal will ensure that the NCTN Program is provided access to UAB CCC clinical and translational investigators with a broad interest in cancer biology and experimental therapeutics.

The main goals of this application are to sustain and grow our NCORP Community Site, focusing on improving patient outcomes and reducing health disparities in M/U populations throughout the State of Georgia and beyond. Georgia has some of the nation's worst cancer disparities. The cancer experience for African Americans in Georgia varies widely from that of Caucasians and is especially evident in the disproportionate and astounding mortality rates from several common cancers (e.g., colorectal and breast cancers). Our original program was aptly named Georgia CaRes (Georgia Cancer Research) and represents our shared commitment to cancer research, including studies in cancer control, cancer prevention, and cancer care delivery, as well as clinical trials from NCI's National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). The renewal of Georgia CaRes will allow us to continue to serve large regions of the state with high concentrations of minority and medically underserved populations. We will accomplish this through the following Specific Aims: 1) Georgia CaRes will facilitate participation and enrollment of patients and healthcare providers into cancer control, prevention, and cancer care delivery research (CCDR) studies developed by NCI's Research Bases and in human research trials of the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN); 2) Georgia CaRes will support and strengthen NCORP goals by improving the scope of our activities as an NCORP M/U Community Site; and 3) Georgia CaRes will increase collaboration across our NCORP M/U Community network and with the Research Bases. Renewal of Georgia CaRes will have a significant and far-reaching impact on the health of minority and underserved populations within the State of Georgia and beyond. The State of Georgia experiences significant cancer incidence and mortality disparities within its minority and underserved communities. Our Georgia CaRes NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Minority/Underserved Site addresses these disparities by focusing on providing clinical trials, cancer control and prevention trials, and cancer care delivery research to Georgia's minority and underserved communities (rural, inner city). Renewal of Georgia CaRes will greatly impact the public health (especially with respect to cancer) of minority and underserved communities within the State of Georgia and beyond.",Georgia CaRes,9999472,UG1CA189851,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Leadership ', ' Mississippi ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Names ', ' Patient Participation ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rural Population ', ' Universities ', ' Urban Population ', ' Caucasians ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Occidental ', ' white race ', ' Gender ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Discipline ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Rural ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' Childhood Cancers ', ' Malignant Childhood Tumor ', ' Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Pediatric Tumor ', ' Malignant childhood cancer ', ' cancer in a child ', ' cancer in children ', ' child with cancer ', ' childhood malignancy ', ' children with cancer ', ' pediatric cancer ', ' pediatric malignancy ', ' Malignant Childhood Neoplasm ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' Committee Membership ', ' Hematopoietic Cell Tumor ', ' Hematopoietic Malignancies ', ' Hematopoietic Neoplasms including Lymphomas ', ' Hematopoietic Tumor ', ' Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Cell Neoplasm ', ' Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Hematopoietic Neoplasm ', ' blood cancer ', ' Hematopoietic Neoplasms ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' inner city ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically underserved population ', ' Documentation ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Collection ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Oncology ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' minority health ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' control trial ', ' Morehouse Sch of Medicine ', ' Morehouse School of Med ', ' Morehouse School of Medicine ', ' screening ', ' Prevention trial ', ' NCI National Clinical Trials Network ', ' National Clinical Trials Network ', ' underserved minority ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' mortality disparity ', ' imaging study ', ' clinical trial enrollment ', ' ']",NCI,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,UG1,2020,1146596,0.11126694603007599
"NRG Oncology NCORP Research Base The objective of this proposal is to establish and maintain the NCORP (National Community Oncology Research Program) for the NRG Oncology research base. The NRG NCORP is the result of aligning the legacy CCOPs (Community Clinical Oncology Programs) from three NCI Cancer Cooperative Groups: NSABP, RTOG and GOG. These groups together have over almost 100 years of combined experience serving as CCOP Research Bases. NRG NCORP, comprised of a multi-disciplinary team of investigators and patient advocates, is poised to carry out the objectives of: 1) designing and conducting cancer prevention, control and screening clinical trials; 2) designing and embedding patient reported outcomes in both primary NCOPR trials as well as NRG therapeutic trials 3) designing and conducting cancer care delivery research; 4) enhancing community access to treatment and imaging trials conducted under the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and 5) conducting primary intervention trials and integrating health disparity research questions into cancer care delivery research and treatment trials. To allow NRG NCORP to meet these goals, the group will: participate fully in NRG Oncology leadership and will determine the scientific direction and prioritization of the NRG NCORP activities and resources and oversee the translational research, clinical trial activities, and correlative studies related to the aims of NRG NCORP. With the NRG Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC), this team will provide efficient, methodologically up-to-date trial design with a focus on NCORP specific needs such as patient-reported repeated longitudinal assessments and cluster-randomized designs. NRG NCORP will provide study monitoring, reporting, and analysis; build an infrastructure to support our cancer care delivery research agenda; provide comprehensive data management quality control and quality assurance programs to ensure high data integrity and timely data for analysis; leverage cutting edge information technology emphasizing security, timeliness, and efficiency of data collection and management; providing RT credentialing and quality assurance; and provide education and training for institutional Clinical Research Associates, Study Chairs, local Principal Investigators and others involved in the NRG NCORP research agenda. Further, to accomplish these aims NRG NCORP will engage fully with NCI-designated NCORP community physicians and patient advocates as well as the NCI and other NCI-sponsored entities (cooperative groups, cancer centers, SPOREs) to collaborate across the NCTN to improve cancer prevention and control, cancer care and outcomes, and quality of life for patients affected by cancer. NRG Oncology NCORP research will significantly impact cancer prevention, screening, control and care delivery, and bring state-of-the-art treatment trials to community centers where most cancer treatments are delivered. NRG NCORP will conduct high impact studies for patients with many types of solid tumors with a particular unique focus in both women's health and cancer control issues related to radiation therapy. To accomplish these aims NRG NCORP will engage fully with community physicians and patient advocates as well as the NCI and NCI- designated cancer centers to collaborate to improve cancer prevention and control, cancer care and outcomes, and quality of life for patients affected by cancer.",NRG Oncology NCORP Research Base,9999464,UG1CA189867,"['Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', '

"Baptist Memorial Health Care/Mid South NCORP Minority Underserved Consortium The Baptist Memorial Health Care/Mid-South Minority Underserved NCORP is part of Baptist Memorial Healthcare Corporation (BMHCC), a non-for-profit faith-based healthcare system with 22 hospitals, 21 outpatient oncology clinics, 8 radiation facilities, and 19 outpatient infusion centers, providing care for approximately 8000 new cancer patients each year. BMHCC’s service area covers 111 counties, 4.3 million people. This is 44% of the 252 counties and parishes in the Delta Regional Authority, congressionally acknowledged as the most indigent population in the US. BMHCC provides 25% of cancer care in this racially, socioeconomically and culturally diverse region, which has some of the highest volumes of cancer and the most fragile public health infrastructure in the US. Before our NCORP, these patients had no access to clinical trials. In the 4 years since our NCORP began in August 2014, more than 90 patients per year have been enrolled into trials, including 168 patients in 2017/18; 39% of our enrolled patients are racial minorities, 17% reside in rural areas, 13% are uninsured, 21% have Medicaid. Members of our NCORP serve on multiple NCORP taskforces and NCI Steering Committees, including the Cancer Prevention Steering Committee. We have used our unique expertise in establishing Multidisciplinary Care Delivery programs in Breast, Thoracic, Gastrointestinal and Hematologic Oncology to develop Disease-Specific Research Groups that link our NCORP research closely to our clinical oncology care programs. This strategy has accelerated our progress in the past 2 years. Our system-wide implementation of the Electronic Health Record system, EPIC, has enhanced our research ability, especially in Cancer Care Delivery Research. For the new funding cycle, we propose to expand our NCORP research infrastructure across the full extent of BMHCC, with special emphasis on increasing patient recruitment across the state of Mississippi. Using Implementation and Team Science principles and a data-driven approach, our overarching goal is to increase the proportion of BMHCC oncology patients who participate in clinical trials from <3% in 2018 to 10% by 2025. With almost 8000 annual new cancer cases, this would significantly exceed the minimum requirements of the NCORP, to the benefit of our patients, communities and healthcare system, because we believe that ‘the best treatment is a clinical trial.’ Our specific aims are to increase the: 1.) number of active sites from 5 to 16 by 2025, by expanding to all our Mississippi institutions; 2.) proportion of oncology-related providers accruing patients to >90%; 3.) clinical trials activity in urogenital and gynecologic oncology; 4.) average annual patient-enrollment into NCORP trials from 90 to >250. Achieving our goal will help achieve the NCI’s mission of improving the health of this key US population demographic by narrowing a major recognized health disparity: poor access of the large indigent, racial minority and rural populations within the Mississippi Delta region to high quality oncologic care. The Baptist Memorial Health Care/Mid-South Minority Underserved NCORP is located in the Delta Regional Authority’s catchment area, serving the most indigent population in the US. We have successfully brought clinical trials access to this heavily underserved population, with 39% of our enrolled patients being racial minorities and 17% residing in rural areas, and 34% under-insured. We now seek to expand the reach of our NCORP to cover all of the state of Mississippi, Eastern Arkansas and West Tennessee, thereby providing greater access to the large indigent, racial minority and rural populations within the Mississippi Delta region.",Baptist Memorial Health Care/Mid South NCORP Minority Underserved Consortium,9998887,UG1CA189873,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Arkansas ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Health Service Area ', ' Health Catchment Area ', ' Service area ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heel ', ' Hematology ', ' Hospitals ', ' Indigent ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mission ', ' Mississippi ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Private Practice ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' Science ', ' Tennessee ', ' Genitourinary system ', ' Genitourinary ', ' Urogenital ', ' Urogenital System ', ' County ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' forest ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Underinsured ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' Malignant Thoracic Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Thoracic Tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Thorax ', ' thoracic cancer ', ' thoracic malignancies ', ' Malignant neoplasm of thorax ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Active Sites ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Funding ', ' Oncologist ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Baptists ', ' Baptist Church ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' authority ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Radiation ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Clinical Oncology ', ' Gynecologic Oncology ', ' Data ', ' ECOG ', ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' ACRIN ', ' American College of Radiology Imaging Network ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' CTEP ', ' Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ', ' Catchment Area ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' SWOG ', ' Southwest Oncology Group ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' inpatient care ', ' inpatient service ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' social health determinants ', ' underserved minority ', ' racial minority ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,BAPTIST MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - TIPTON,UG1,2020,1232543,0.11779594658415389
"SPORE in Brain Cancer SUMMARY: OVERALL The overarching goal of this Brain Cancer SPORE renewal application is to improve the notoriously poor outcome of patients with glioblastoma (GBM). This goal will be achieved through the development of a multidisciplinary and highly translational research program that seeks to discover and rapidly translate novel and mechanistically diverse treatment strategies, including biological, immunological and targeted strategies, and by developing prognostic and predictive biomarkers that inform individualized approaches to GBM treatment, while also exploring pathogenesis and risk through genetic-based epidemiological studies in minority populations. By pursuing the strategies of this research program, all projects in the current funding period (2013-18) have successfully transitioned from the bench to clinical trials, including testing of a novel oncolytic virus, Delta-24- RGD, in multiple clinical trials; completing a biological-endpoint Phase II clinical trial of a PI3K-targeted agent, BKM-120; meeting IND requirements for a first-in-human trial of a new immune-modulatory p-STAT-3 inhibitor, WP1066; and validating prognostic biomarkers in clinical trial datasets, while also testing a molecular predictor of radiation sensitivity. In this renewal application we propose three translational research projects that organically evolved from the successes of our current SPORE, and which are supported by four mission-critical Cores (Administrative, Pathology/Biorepository, Biostatistics/ Bioinformatics, Animal). Our Developmental Research Program (DRP) and Career Enhancement Program (CEP) continue as incubators of new projects and portals for new investigators. The aims of our projects are: Project 1: Exploit the capacity of Delta-24-RGD to activate anti-glioma immunity by completing a clinical trial combining Delta-24-RGD with Pembrolizumab, and by testing next-generation Delta-24-RGD viruses that are armed with immune stimulatory molecules: OX40L, GITRL, and 4-1BBL, while analyzing anti-Ad5 antibodies as a biomarker in response to therapy. Project 2: Attack metabolic vulnerabilities of GBMs through the development and clinical testing of a novel inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), IACS-010759, that efficiently kills GBMs harboring genetic or epigenetic mutations that impair glycolysis (e.g. ENO1 deletions), and by evaluating a new hypoxia-responsive PET probe, 18F-FAZA, as a readout of OxPhos inhibition and target engagement of IACS-010759. Project 3: Decipher germline and somatic genomic landscape of gliomas in Black and Hispanic minority populations, whose prognosis and survival differ than GBM patients of White European descent. Germline SNP data will be combined with extensive molecular profiling in case-matched tumors. A detailed analysis will be performed to determine ancestry composition and how it influences risk for gliomas and clinical outcome in minorities. NARRATIVE: OVERALL Over the past 20 years, advances in the treatment of glioblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor, have been only incremental. If successful, the research proposed in this Brain Cancer SPORE renewal application will legitimize novel, mechanistically unique therapies and decipher the genomic landscape of gliomas in minority populations, thereby changing the standards of care for all patients with human gliomas, including underserved minorities.",SPORE in Brain Cancer,10005119,P50CA127001,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', '

"Northwell Health NCORP Project Summary: With 35 years expertise providing vital cancer research, the Northwell Health Cancer Institute is applying to continue as a community site for the National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP). Cancer has been identified as a high priority in our catchment area and, through affiliations with the various NCORP Research bases, our site is able to bring cancer clinical research to the populations in our community. In alignment with NCORP goals, the Northwell Health NCORP will continue to: 1. provide patients access to national cancer control, prevention, treatment, and care delivery studies, 2. engage with underrepresented populations to reduce health disparities and increase health equity, and 3. identify significant concerns raised by our unique local populations. As the program continues, our community site will enhance relationships with all Northwell Health Divisions and strengthen communication between primary and sub- affiliate sites. The Northwell Health Cancer Institute, including 9 NCORP performance site, is a multi-faceted program which treats approximately 14,000 patients with cancer annually. Since the inception of the new NCORP in 2014, over 300 patient have been accrued to NCI sponsored trials adding to the broad evidence base which contributed to improved patient outcomes.

"Arkansas ECHO ISPCTN Site (AREIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Children living in rural regions of the United States have limited opportunities for research participation. The Institutional Development Award (IDeA) Program was launched in 1993 to enhance biomedical research opportunities in states with low rates of National Institutes of Health funding. The Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN) was formed in 2015 to provide clinical trial participation opportunities to children living in IDeA states and to enhance workforce capacity for pediatric clinical trials. The ARkansas ECHO ISPCTN Site (AREIS) based at Arkansas Children’s Research Institute will build upon previous work and continue to expand research participation opportunities for children living in rural regions in Arkansas. To this end, AREIS will continue to work closely with the Data Coordinating and Operations Center, with other ISPCTN sites, and with local experts affiliated with the Clinical and Translational Sciences Award at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. In the next cycle of funding, AREIS will 1) provide research expertise and leadership to the ECHO ISPCTN for the development and implementation of robust clinical trials in high priority ECHO focus areas; 2) increase clinical trials competency and leadership skills among AREIS faculty and staff; and 3) leverage existing resources to implement innovative community engagement and community partnership approaches that will enhance the participation of rural children in clinical trials. Innovations in clinical trials, such as the incorporation of telehealth approaches, will allow AREIS to conduct research in low-resourced settings, such as rural communities. The collective impact of this research with increase the enrollment of rural children in clinical trials in ECHO focus areas and increase clinical trial competencies among faculty and staff affiliated with AREIS. In addition, the continued development of strong partnerships with other ISPCTN sites and the DCOC will enhance the success of future research collaborations in ECHO priority areas. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children living in rural regions of the United States (US) have reduced access to medical care and few chances to participate in research. This project will address this problem by working in collaboration with a group of pediatric researchers to develop and conduct research studies that improve general knowledge of diseases common in children in rural areas, such as asthma, opioid addiction, and obesity. By enhancing the research skills of junior researchers and supporting research interactions with communities, this project will increase research participation and enhance the health of children living in rural regions of the US.",Arkansas ECHO ISPCTN Site (AREIS),10063720,UG1OD024945,"['Abbreviations ', ' Academy ', ' Affect ', ' Arkansas ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Award ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Digestive System Disorders ', ' Digestive Diseases ', ' Digestive System Diseases ', ' GI tract disorder ', ' digestive disorder ', ' digestive tract disease ', ' gastrointestinal tract disease ', ' gastrointestinal tract disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Institutes ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome ', ' Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' Neonatal Substance Withdrawal ', ' Neonatal Withdrawal Syndrome ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Competence ', ' Out-Migrations ', ' Rural Community ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' postnatal ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid dependent ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' pediatric department ', ' experience ', ' pediatric pharmacology ', ' success ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' skills ', ' research study ', ' outreach ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' telehealth ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' COBRE ', ' Center of Biomedical Research Excellence ', ' Centers of Research Excellence ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' 18 years of age ', ' age 18 years ', ' eighteen year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' 18 year old ', ' tertiary care ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' clinical care ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' operation ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' gestational weight gain ', ' community partnership ', ' Supplementation with vitamin D ', ' vitamin D supplement ', ' Vitamin D supplementation ', ' Child Health ', ' pediatric services ', ' child services ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' Airway Disease ', ' ']",OD,ARKANSAS CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL RES INST,UG1,2020,420750,0.0639246754054188
"Southern Consortium Node of the Clinical Trials Network Abstract  The Southern Consortium Node (SCN) has been an integral part of the NIDA-funded Clinical Trials Network (CTN) consortium since 2000, evolving to meet changing CTN needs and leading and contributing to a portfolio of compelling addiction science and treatment research projects with outstanding performance metrics. We have expanded our network throughout the Southeast and established close and collaborative working relationships with a diverse and geographically dispersed group of programs including primary care and medical specialty practices. We have a cost-effective system for accessing specialized expertise for specific CTN trials. We have solid collaborative relationships with community substance use disorder (SUD) treatment programs, primary care providers and governmental agencies that facilitate research, implementation and dissemination efforts. Our CTN efforts are complemented and enhanced by our statewide CTSA infrastructure, creating a research capacity that extends far beyond our academic home.  For this renewal, we propose to further expand our network to include six rural states in the Southeast with a research agenda focused on best practices for bringing evidence-based care to underserved rural populations across the full continuum of care. We will develop a Health Technology Core to facilitate exploration of the use of technology to address health disparities in SUD treatment. We will develop an Implementation Science Core and employ Learning Health System principles to move positive findings into our partnering practice systems, fulfilling the core CTN mission of moving evidence-based treatment beyond academic settings.  In sum, the SCN has demonstrated remarkable flexibility, creativity and the collaborative and innovative spirit required to meet new challenges and take advantage of growing CTN opportunities. We have gathered a multidisciplinary team with expertise in addiction psychiatry, clinical research, informatics, analytics, healthcare technology, dissemination and implementation science. We will employ our resources and expertise in innovative areas to address identified gaps in access, engagement and retention in treatment for individuals with SUDs. The SCN team looks forward to continued participation in the CTN consortium.

"Metro-Minnesota Community Oncology Research Consortium (MMCORC) Project Summary The Metro-Minnesota Community Oncology Research Consortium (MMCORC), formerly known as the Metro- Minnesota Community Clinical Oncology Program (MMCCOP), has a long history of success, as demonstrated by the ongoing commitment of is original members and the consortium's growth from 1979 to 2018. Today, MMCORC is an established community program that began through its National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded Community Hospital Cancer Program Award. This program improved cancer care delivery in the community and was the cornerstone for the Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) initiative. It received the initial NCI CCOP grant in 1983 and has been awarded subsequent CCOP grants in 3- to 5-year increments until the 5-year NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) grant in 2014. In 2010, hospitals, clinics, and oncologists in the MN Community Group Outreach Program joined MMCCOP, resulting in a metro-wide community cancer research program in Minneapolis-St. Paul. In 2014, MMCCOP received funding under the new NCORP grant program. In 2016, MMCCOP was renamed MMCORC to represent the disbanding of the NCI CCOP grant program and show the broad scope of oncology research services available to the community, consistent with a consortium model. MMCORC represents 25 hospital and clinics with a common approach and established mechanisms for identifying, enrolling, and following participants on NCI- sponsored treatment, cancer prevention and control, symptom management, and care delivery research protocols. The state health market remains extremely competitive and is constantly changing due to mergers and healthcare reform initiatives. Despite this environment, MMCORC hospitals and staff continue to collaborate and support the added time and expense of offering clinical research trials to patients in the communities we serve. The consortium incorporates a substantial segment of the oncology community and has provided a basis for communication, partnership, and collaboration among practicing oncologists, their hospital administrators, and other health professionals for 35 years. Combined, the consortium members see, on average, more than 17,170 new analytic cancer patients per year. In the consortium, 165 MD investigators represent medical oncology, hematology, and radiation and surgical oncology, including thoracic surgery, gynecologic oncology, radiology, neuro-oncology, obstetrics and gynecology, palliative care, and primary care, with 57 mid-level clinicians (nurse practitioners and physician assistants) considered associate investigators. MMCORC intends to continue to offer the community the most recent advances in cancer prevention, treatment, symptom management, and care delivery through continued affiliations with NCORP research bases such as Alliance, ECOG-ACRIN, NRG Oncology, SWOG via CTSU, URCC, and CCCWFU. By implementing proactive strategies to improve access and encourage participation from underrepresented and underserved groups, MMCORC is well positioned to achieve the goals of the NCORP set forth by the NCI. Project Narrative Clinical trials are a vital part of the research process. Access to oncology clinical trials remains essential to address the many unmet needs in cancer prevention, control, screening, and treatment. The bulk of cancer care takes place in community settings, so allowing patients from community hospitals to participate in national clinical research allows access to a larger, more diverse patient population to promote increased patient outcomes and reduce disparities. With this funding opportunity, the Metro-Minnesota Community Oncology Research Consortium (MMCORC) will continue to provide people in our community access to the newest therapies available for cancer treatment, symptom management, and cancer prevention, along with the opportunity to participate in trials that examine how the cancer care delivery process influences clinical outcomes and patient well-being.",Metro-Minnesota Community Oncology Research Consortium (MMCORC),9995430,UG1CA189863,"['American Cancer Society ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', '

"Kaiser Permanente NCI National Community Oncology Research Program, NCORP ASTRACT The Kaiser Permanente (KP) NCORP Community Site is committed to the principle that including community providers and a diverse patient population is essential to advancing oncology research. The KP NCORP Community Site has decades of experience conducting cancer clinical trial, care delivery, and disparities research. During the first funding cycle, the KP NCORP Community Site brought the benefits of our racially and ethnically diverse membership, increased access/accrual to clinical trials, and conducted cancer care delivery research. The KP NCORP Community Site was exceptionally successful with both total and specific trial enrollment to studies with our affiliated research bases. In 2017, for example, the KP NCORP Community Site was the second-highest enrolling member of SWOG for total accrual and the highest for CTEP-funded, SWOG-credited trials. In addition, KP NCORP Community Site clinicians and population scientists served on numerous NCI and Research Base Steering, Scientific, and Working Group Committees, making important contributions to the NCORP research agenda. In the next funding cycle, we will continue to participate in this integrated national network of community organizations to increase the involvement of community oncologists, other medical specialists, and our patients. Continued participation in multi-institutional cancer control, prevention, and care delivery research, as well as quality-of-life studies embedded within treatment and imaging studies conducted under the NCORP and NCTN, will benefit the community at large. Our clinician and population scientists will continue to serve on NCI and Research Base committees and provide insight into clinical significance, identifying care disparities, and provide input on feasibility during protocol development. We will continue to recruit patients, including enrolling participants from underrepresented populations. NARRATIVE As a member of NCORP’s integrated network of community organizations and research bases, the Kaiser Permanente (KP) NCORP Community Site will bring medical advances to the community at large by increasing clinical trial access and accrual to cancer control, prevention, symptom management, imaging, treatment, and cancer care delivery research. KP’s integrated health plan presents an ideal platform for accelerating the translation of findings into clinical practice.","Kaiser Permanente NCI National Community Oncology Research Program, NCORP",10001450,UG1CA189821,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Funding ', ' Oncologist ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' Observation in research ', ' Shapes ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' outreach program ', ' protocol development ', ' Genomics ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' medical specialist ', ' cancer care ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Prevention Trial ', ' CTEP ', ' Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Oncology ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' SWOG ', ' Southwest Oncology Group ', ' Training and Infrastructure ', ' Administrative Management ', ' Office of Administrative Management ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' cancer imaging ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' community organizations ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' knowledge translation ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' screening ', ' NCI National Clinical Trials Network ', ' National Clinical Trials Network ', ' Minority Participation ', ' webinar ', ' oncology clinical trial ', ' cancer clinical trial ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' imaging study ', ' recruit ', ' health plans ', ' health plan ', ' community involvement ', ' social factors ', ' data infrastructure ', ' harmonized data ', ' data harmonization ', ' clinical trial enrollment ', ' ']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,UG1,2020,4763899,0.11612435785769247
"NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Minority/Underserved Community Sites PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overarching goal of the New Mexico MU-NCORP is to improve the quality of cancer care throughout our catchment area (the State of New Mexico) and to eliminate the tremendous burden of cancer health disparities in the multiethnic populations that we serve by building innovative statewide outreach programs, founded in community-based participatory research methods and scientific collaborations between community health systems and providers with the primary academic affiliate site, resulting in an increased awareness, acceptance, access, and participation by all New Mexicans in NCI-sponsored cancer screening, post-treatment surveillance, prevention, and therapeutic clinical trials. The University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer (UNMCCC) serves as the primary affiliate with strong scientific programs in cancer population sciences, cancer control, health disparities, and clinical interventions, in partnership with nearly all New Mexico health systems and community cancer care sites that are consortium members of the New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance (NMCCA, secondary affiliate), a joint 501c3 statewide clinical trials research network that provides the major clinical trials infrastructure to support the goals of the NCI NCORP. This NM MU-NCORP organization continues to engage all stakeholders in our cancer health mission and builds upon a well-established 20 year partnership supported in part by prior NCI MB-CCOP and current NCORP grants. This consortium has a proven track record and success in enrolling New Mexico's highly diverse multiethnic, rural, and underserved cancer patients in NCTN trials and has launched several cancer care delivery (CCDR) trials that are of great interest to our community partners. The NM MU-NCORP will continue to be actively engaged in developing research strategies across the NCORP Research Bases and will serve as working partners throughout the NCORP Network. With the highest percentage of Hispanics and American Indians of any state, New Mexico's 2.1 million citizens are 39% non- Hispanic White, 47% Hispanic, 10% American Indian, 2.4% Black, and 1.6% Asian and other ethnic minorities. New Mexico ranks at the bottom (48th) in the U.S. in annual per capita income and a substantial number of New Mexicans, particularly its minority populations, are poor, rural, and underserved. With the nation's highest rate (30%) of childhood poverty, nearly 20% of all New Mexicans live in poverty and 10-13% of New Mexicans, depending on the county, still lack health insurance. Our research strategy is focused on academic/community team partnerships to address all aspects of cancer screening, prevention, cancer control, cancer care delivery, and therapeutic intervention in order to prioritize and optimize trial-based cancer care, while enhancing collaboration with the NCORP Research Bases in order to generate the next generation of trials to address the cancer disparities of the New Mexicans served by the MU-NCORP. Project Narrative The relevance of the New Mexico Minority-Underserved NCORP (MU-NCORP) lies in the deep rooted mission of our longstanding partnership of academic and community cancer providers and other community stakeholders managed through a unique statewide consortium infrastructure (UNM Comprehensive Cancer Center and the New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance) to deliver the highest quality in all aspects of cancer care (cancer screening, prevention control and cancer care delivery) to all New Mexicans with a strong focus on eradicating disparities in access, care delivery and outcomes. Our growth as an NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center with scientific programmatic focus on innovative approaches to cancer delivery and disparities research in our unique New Mexican populations in conjunction with our longstanding community partnerships through nearly 20 years of work as an MB-CCOP and now MU-NCOORP continues to support our progress in meaningful reduction in cancer burden and better understanding of barriers to care for our population. Continued team work with all academic, community oncology and tribal and other community stakeholders while serving as leaders within the NCI NCORP, CTEP and DCP with bidirectional research engagement will continue to strengthen our program and effectiveness in improving quality and length of life for New Mexicans and other minority populations.",NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP)

"MaineHealth Cancer Care Network (MHCCN) and NCORP Activities across the Lifespan Abstract  Maine ranks 12th and 8th in adult cancer incidence and mortality respectively, and pediatric cancer incidence rates are the third highest in the nation, contributing to marked cancer health disparities in our state. In 2018, it is estimated there will be 8,600 new adult cancer cases diagnosed in Maine; cancer is the most common cause of death in our state. Of these adult cases, 6,185 (72%) will receive their care at a MaineHealth Cancer Care Network (MHCCN) hospital or outpatient facility. This patient volume is akin to any major metropolitan cancer center. With only 1.3 million residents, Maine is a small state, is the most rural state, and has the oldest population in the nation. There are significant cancer risk behaviors and exposures, and there are numerous socioeconomic and geographic challenges as well, further compounding our cancer burden. The MHCCN is clearly organized around patient, health provider, and healthcare system multi-tiered strategies and interventions that are prioritized in the NCORP solicitation and defended in this proposal. Our health system embarked upon a comprehensive oncology strategic planning process in 2014 that in a relatively short period has led to the opportunity to submit our response to this FOA. Consensus was reached on the model of cancer care that we would pursue. The singular goal is to ensure that ""the right care, in the right location, as close to home as possible"" will be provided. Cancer patients in our state and their families desire access to state-of-the-art patient-centered care. This NCORP application could not come at a more auspicious time for our organization, coinciding with significant growth and substantive multi- million dollar investment in MH Oncology over the past couple years. With this backdrop, the fundamental goal of our application is to commit and contribute to a robust slate of NCORP activities across the lifespan including pediatric, adolescent and young adults, adults, and elderly cancer patients in our communities and rural care settings. We have assembled a highly interactive and interdisciplinary team across our network to participate in and lead this research endeavor. Our central hypothesis is that developing a highly interactive and interdisciplinary approach to cancer care that is at all times patient-centered throughout MH Oncology will have salutary effects on all aspects of our cancer care across the continuum of prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, end-of-life, and care delivery not only for our patients and their families but for other aspects critical to our mission – including educating the next generation of healthcare providers and expanding our research pursuits especially in rural areas within our care network. We propose 4 aims: To conduct and actively participate in 1) cancer control research, 2) cancer prevention research, and 3) cancer care delivery research studies; and 4) to capitalize upon clinical research opportunities afforded by NCORP and our newly awarded Northern New England Clinical and Translational Research Network grant (1U54 GM115517). We will pursue these aims across the lifespan engaging both children and adults. The MHCNN has every expectation that will we make substantive contributions across the spectrum of the NCORP research portfolio. We will capitalize on our institutional assets, patient resources, and expertise from the vantage point of community and rural settings to add value across the lifespan and provide leadership to the NCORP. We welcome and value the opportunity to join the NCORP network as a new institutional member. Public Health Relevance  The State of Maine faces challenging cancer heath disparities, as it is the most rural and oldest state in the nation. Historically, cancer patients and their families in Maine have had inconsistent access to state-of-the-art federally-sponsored cancer research trials. The MaineHealth Cancer Care Network (MHCCN) Lifespan proposal provides a wonderful opportunity and departure point for our organization to be considered for inclusion in the NCI Community Oncology Program and to provide access for our patients to this vital resource. We value making substantive contributions and providing leadership to NCORP over the next award period.",MaineHealth Cancer Care Network (MHCCN) and NCORP Activities across the Lifespan,9994855,UG1CA239771,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Award ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Denmark ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Evolution ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Investments ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Maine ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -
