"DISPARITIES IN ORAL HEALTH OUTCOMES BETWEEN SES GROUPS The objectives of the proposed research are (1) to study the patterns of  disparities in oral health outcomes (including oral diseases and oral  quality of life) among socioeconomic (SES) groups and (2) to analyze the  impact of the individual's SES constraints, oral health beliefs, and oral  health behavior on the disparities in oral health outcomes among SES  groups and to examine the relationships between the financing and  organization of oral health care systems and the patterns of disparities  in oral health outcomes. Both objectives will involve comparisons across  international study sites. To achieve these objectives, this study  proposes to use the data already collected from the International  Collaborative Study of Oral Health Outcomes (ICS II). ICS II data sets  contain both clinical and social survey data for three age groups (12-13,  35-44, and 65-74) in each of seven study sites. These sites include  Erfurt, former East Germany; Lodz, Poland; New Zealand; Yamanashi, Japan;  and Baltimore, Maryland and Navajo and Sioux Indian Health Service sites  in the U.S. The index of ""excess oral morbidity"" will be used to measure  the extent of the disparity in oral health outcomes between SES  (educational, occupational, and income) groups and to identify the SES  groups with the most disadvantaged oral health outcomes. Standardization  techniques will be used to examine the impact of the selected variables  on oral health disparity. Finally, as the ICS II sites offer a wide range  of general health and oral health care systems, a qualitative and  comparative analysis will be conducted to examine how the characteristics  of these systems relate to oral health disparities.

"UCLA KING DREW RRCMOH The immense racial, ethnic, and cultural richness of the greater Los             Angeles metropolitan area is unparalleled in the United States.                  Correspondingly, however, the social disparity between minority and              majority populations is all too evident--leading, even, to overt civil           unrest in recent years.  It is within this context that the UCLA-King/Drew       Regional Research Center for Minority Oral Health (RRCMOH), Phase I, was         initiated on September 29, 1992.  Its two-fold mission is to train               minority researchers and to improve the oral health of racial and                underrepresented minorities in the single largest population center in the       Western United States.  The present Phase II application seeks                   continuation funding to allow the Center to build upon the substantial           accomplishments of the Phase I program and to achieve the Center's long-         term objectives: (1) To study oral health problems uniquely relevant to          the needs of minority populations. (2) To expand research and research           training opportunities for minority scientists by encouraging their              participation in oral health research. (3) To develop and strengthen the         biomedical and behavioral oral health research capacity of the Charles R.        Drew Medical University/Martin Luther King, Jr. Medical Center.  The Phase       II Center will continue to develop and conduct multidisciplinary research        on three key aspects of oral health-related morbidity, disability, and           mortality among minority populations.  Each corresponds to a major               subproject and each shares the common theme of orofacial injury.                                                                                                  The Phase II Center is based on the unifying conception that minority            populations in the United States suffer disproportionately the                   consequences of orofacial injury.  They are the victims of violence and          bear a disparate share of the short-term and the long-term consequences of       acute and chronic orofacial injury.  African-American and Hispanic               minority populations, in particular, exhibit a familial predisposition           toward abnormal soft tissue repair secondary to injury and they are              disproportionately vulnerable to oral malignancy arising from long-term,         low-grade traumatic injury to oral mucosa.  The Phase II subprojects and         pilot projects therefore address (a) the increased vulnerability of              minority populations to serious orofacial trauma (Subproject 1 and Pilot         Project 1), (b) the increased predisposition of such populations to              abnormal healing after sustaining such injury (Subproject 2 and Pilot            Project 2), and (c) the disproportionate vulnerability of such populations       to overt malignant neoplastic disease consequent to chronic oral injury          (Subproject 3 and Pilot Project 3).  These are not classic dental diseases       in the usual sense, but they are all identified, appropriately, in the           NIH/NIDR Phase II Program Announcement as important areas relevant to            minority oral health needs.

The long-term aim of this      international research consortium is to determine optimum interventions to           reduce dental caries in children in disadvantaged communities and minimize the                                                         effects of exclusion from health care systems, of ethnic diversity, and health       inequalities. Research is lacking in the interactions vertically in the              paradigm between molecular and psychosocial impacts within and between               ethnically diverse and impoverished children. Three specific aims are to be          addressed under this planning grant. First to examine the microflora of              ethnically diverse children with and without dental caries and determine             whether there are differences in the pattern, the virulence and the behavior to      fluoride. Second, to develop, validate and pilot a measure of familial and           cultural perceptions and beliefs that contribute to the development of caries        experience in children from diverse ethnic and socio-economic groups. Third, to      identify the characteristics of children with adverse health service                 utilization rates and the characteristics of those health services which result      in minimum exclusion and more favorable and equitable health outcomes. This          consortium comprises 32 scientists from 10 countries from a range of                 disciplines with data from many research studies, each augmenting any                individual country's efforts.

"NYU Oral Cancer RAAHP Center This proposed NYU Oral Cancer Research for Adolescent and Adult Health Promotion (RAAHP) Center is a P50 Center which was designed in response to the NIDCR request for applications for Centers for Research to Reduce Oral Health Disparities (RFA:DE-99-003). The overall goal of this proposed NY Oral Cancer RAAHP Center is to conduct studies and promote activities that will reduce oral disparities in the United States. While oral cancer occurs in all segments of the U.S. population, oral cancer rates (both incidence and mortality) are highest among minority populations, especially in African Americans and in Hispanics. Specifically, this proposed Center will, as stated in the RFA, support research ""that will lead to an understanding of the factors associated with health disparities as well as to the support and development, testing and evaluation of interventions designed to reduce [oral cancer] disparities"". The Specific Aims of the overall Center are: 1) to conduct a set of five major studies, as fully described in this grant application; 2) to design and conduct a sixth major study on oral cancer in the theme of this Center; 3.) to stimulate and support the design, writing and submission of Developmental 'Spin-Off'; 4.) to stimulate and support the development, selection, funding and implementation of two types of pilot research studies: bioethics and scientific pilot studies; 5.) to maintain three Cores (Administrative, Informatics, and Biostatistics) that will support the scientific activities of all the investigators in this proposed Center; 6) to develop and implement a full set of intra-Center research training and career development activities which focus on creating opportunities for scientists from underrepresented groups within the scientific workforce; 7) to participate fully in inter-Center national research and training networks; 8) to serve as an intellectual and administrative nidus to stimulate oral cancer research interests, discussions, and planning sessions among Center participants as well as among other cancer research colleagues; and 9) to provide information and findings on oral cancer to community involved health service units.

"Oral Health Disparities in the Hispanic Population The purpose of the program is to develop a two and a half day (2 1/2) conference on ""Oral Health Disparities in the Hispanic Population: The Challenge and a Framework for Action "", as part of the Annual Meeting of the Hispanic Dental Association on October 5~', 6th, and 7`"" 2001 in Philadelphia PA. We would like to address the challenge placed by the Surgeon General's report on Oral Health in America as related to the Hispanic population in the United States, and to focus our attention to the objectives presented on the U.S. Department of Public Health and Human Services, ""Healthy People 2010."" The Hispanic Dental Association goal is to provide the necessary leadership among the dental professionals who share a common interest and commitment to improve the oral health of the Hispanic community. A way to achieve this goal is to hold Annual Conferences. The conference will provide the forum to exchange, inform, disseminate, and provide an update in areas concerning diagnosis, prevention and treatment approaches of oral dental diseases. In addition, the HDA Conference attracts senior students, residents, or recently graduated, to which the HDA train and encourage participation in areas concerning the Hispanic population. The conference will consist of four (4) segments that respond to the main challenges that are directly related to the Hispanic community and a keynote speaker presentation, as well as a seminar for Hispanic dental students and residents. I. Keynote speaker: - The Burden of oral disease and the opportunities to enhance oral health among the Hispanic Population. II. Caries - Diagnosis, Prevention and Treatment Approaches. III. Relationship between Systemic Diseases and Oral Health. IV. Oral and Pharyngeal Cancer V.   Building an effective infrastructure to met the oral health needs of Hispanics. VI.  Seminar for Students, Residents and Recent Graduates. The program will have the participation of a distinguished group of scientists that are well known in their respective areas of expertise.

"CHILD ORAL HEALTH QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE  Applicant's Description: Treatment of children with oral and oro-facial              conditions is based on broadly accepted standards tied to the evaluation of          clinical parameters. However, little is known about treatment success - whether      the desired clinical outcomes related to treatment are achieved or whether           patients are satisfied with their treatment outcomes. Research in this area is       limited by a lack of valid, reliable and culturally sensitive instruments to         assess perceived outcomes of care for children and their families. To address        this deficiency, the study will develop a culturally sensitive instrument, the       Child Oral and Oro-Facial Questionnaire (COOFQ) to assess the Oral                   Health-Related Quality of Life (OHROOL) in children across Oral and Oro-Facial       conditions. The instrument will consist of a family of questionnaires; a             Primary Caregiver Perceptions Questionnaire (PCPQ) and age-specific Child            Perceptions Questionnaires (CPQ). The former will tap caregiver (predominantly       parent) perceptions of the child's OHRQOL and the impact of the child's              condition on the family, while the latter will tap the child's perception of         the impact of the condition on his/her well-being and daily life. To address         age-appropriate developmental tasks, age-specific questionnaires are necessary       for children to accommodate age-related changes in children's emotional and          cognitive development. This study is the initial phase of a multi-stage effort       to create three age-appropriate questionnaires for children and will develop a       questionnaire for 10-14 year olds and their caregivers. Because of the greater       complexities associated with the development of questionnaires for younger           children, analogous questionnaires will be developed for children aged 3-5 and       6-9 years at a later date. Children and parents from multiple clinical sites in      two North American locations will be recruited to develop a psychometrically         sound instrument to measure OHRQOL. Specific ethnic groups (African American,        Hispanic, Asians, and Whites) will be recruited to assess the cultural               appropriateness of the questionnaires. This proposal is concerned with the           development of these questionnaires and the assessment of their performance as       discriminatory instruments. Data from this study will provide insight and            preliminary data to develop substantive hypotheses in clinical trials with           pediatric dental patients across a variety of conditions. The ultimate aim of        this instrument is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of services           delivered to pediatric dental patients. The PCPQ and the CPQ will help to            measure the burden of pediatric oral and oro-facial disorders in general             populations, population subgroups and groups of patients, and to evaluate the        effectiveness of pediatric oral care services. Given the disparities in health       status across ethnic groups and SES as well as the thrust to ration health           costs, examining the impact of oral health conditions is essential in                developing health policy.

"A LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF LEAD EXPOSURE AND DENTAL CARIES The long-term goal of our research is to elucidate underlying mechanisms by which the physical and social environments result in health disparities.  Our previous work has shown that the hypothesis that lead exposure is a risk factor for dental caries is plausible and could have significant public health impact, especially for individuals in impoverished circumstances (Watson et al., 1997; Moss et al., 1999). We will study dental caries risk due to environmental lead exposure in a birth cohort of 245 Cincinnati children that have been participants in the Cincinnati Lead Cohort Study since late 1979.  The on-going study of 15-16 year-olds is currently in its third year of funding (R01 ES08158, Early Exposure to Lead and Adolescent Development, P.I.: K. Dietrich).  This group of African-American and white Appalachian children is arguably the most well-described longitudinal cohort ever studied for prenatal and postnatal lead exposure (prenatal maternal blood lead concentration, neonatal blood lead concentration, quarterly assessments of the concentration of lead in blood from birth to 5 years and semi-annually thereafter).  This cohort is unique among the major longitudinal studies of lead and child health in that a substantial number of subjects were exposed to clinically significant levels of lead during early development.  Peak lead exposure in this cohort ranges from 5 to over 80 micrograms/dL. We will collect additional data specifically related to dental caries risk and perform laboratory microanalytic assessments of lead in plaque and enamel.  This will allow us to test a series of hypotheses that relate environmental lead exposure to risk for dental caries development in adolescents. The work of this project will focus on four specific aims related to 1) Demonstrating the strength of the association between environmental lead exposure and risk for dental caries and ruling out alternative explanations; 2) Assessing the utility of permanent tooth enamel, deciduous tooth enamel, deciduous tooth dentin and supragingival plaque as biomarkers for lead exposure using microanalytic techniques; 3) Testing mechanistic hypotheses that show lead exposure a) reduces salivary gland function; b) acts as an effect modifer to reduce the protective effect of salivary fluoride; c) is most strongly linked to caries when measured during enamel formation; 4) Exploring more broadly the basis for oral disease disparities in disadvantaged groups by examining the interplay of lead, nutrition, and social factors.

"Detroit Center for Research on Oral Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant) - The Detroit Center for Research on Oral Health Disparities aims to promote oral health and reduce disparities within the community of low-income African American children (0-5 years) and their main caregivers (14 + years) living in the City of Detroit. The driving theme of the center's research program is to identify determinants and design interventions to answer the following question: why do some low-income African American children and their main caregivers have better oral health than others who live in the same community? The proposed center will focus on studying intra-group disparities in oral health. The community based partners, the City of Detroit Department of Health (DDH) and the Voices of Detroit Initiative (VODI) have strongly supported this theme. The Center will include 3 support cores, 5 research core projects and 1 pilot study. The Center's Methodology Core will select a multistage random sample of African American families living in the poorest 39 Census Tracts in the City of Detroit. A total of 1,529 families will be sampled and interviewed in their homes. It is estimated that 994 families will be examined at community centers in year 2 (2002) funding. Based on extensive data collected by the investigative team (R01 MH58299) in Detroit, the investigators predict that 760 families will be retained by the third examination phase in year 6 (2006). The research teams will investigate the social characteristics of parents, families, and neighborhoods, that are associated with disparities in oral health (dental caries and periodontal diseases) of children and their caregivers; lead levels in saliva of children and saliva and blood (finger prick) of the main caregivers; dietary intake; and genetic, behavioral, social and bacteriologic risk factors of periodontal disease in adults. Using information from 3 core research projects, the investigators propose to develop a tailored multi-media educational intervention (Project #3), based on the transtheoretical model of behavioral change, which will be administered using a randomized controlled design in year 4 of funding, just prior to the second examination phase. Additionally, the center will evaluate the impact on access to dental care of the state-funded experiment on utilization where Medicaid children are managed like privately insured patients (Project #4). The center will support health professionals from the DDH and VODI and the University of Detroit Mercy to receive research training. Doctoral students in three programs targeting minorities in the Schools of Public health and Social Work will be offered stipends to conduct research on health disparities. All families will have access to dental care in a DDH dental clinic (funded by DDH, HRSA, Delta Dental of Michigan and VODI).

The long-term aim of this      international research consortium is to determine optimum interventions to           reduce dental caries in children in disadvantaged communities and minimize the                                                         effects of exclusion from health care systems, of ethnic diversity, and health       inequalities. Research is lacking in the interactions vertically in the              paradigm between molecular and psychosocial impacts within and between               ethnically diverse and impoverished children. Three specific aims are to be          addressed under this planning grant. First to examine the microflora of              ethnically diverse children with and without dental caries and determine             whether there are differences in the pattern, the virulence and the behavior to      fluoride. Second, to develop, validate and pilot a measure of familial and           cultural perceptions and beliefs that contribute to the development of caries        experience in children from diverse ethnic and socio-economic groups. Third, to      identify the characteristics of children with adverse health service                 utilization rates and the characteristics of those health services which result      in minimum exclusion and more favorable and equitable health outcomes. This          consortium comprises 32 scientists from 10 countries from a range of                 disciplines with data from many research studies, each augmenting any                individual country's efforts.

"ORAL HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE DESCRIPTION: The goal of the proposed research training plan for Noelle Huntington is to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to become an independent researcher in children?s oral health. The fulfillment of this goal will occur in two phases. The focus of phase one is the relationship between psychosocial factors and oral health outcomes in adults, and will be investigated through secondary analysis of data from the VA Dental Longitudinal Study (DLS) and Normative Aging Study (NAS). Two sets of questions will be addressed. The first concerns the relationship between three oral health constructs - clinical status, self-report of status, and oral health-related quality of life. The second set of questions concerns the disparity in oral health outcomes by socioeconomic condition. It is hypothesized that factors secondary to socioeconomic condition (e.g., insurance, access) serve as mediators between SES and oral health. Theory-based models of these relationships will be designed and tested using DLS and NAS data, including models of change in oral health status following changes in socioeconomic or mediating variables. The second phase will serve as an orientation to the area of children?s oral health research through the guided development and testing of a measure of oral health-related quality of life in children. This measure will then be used to facilitate future research in oral health-related quality of life, beyond the period covered by this fellowship.

"Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health A Center Addressing Disparities in Children's Oral Health is proposed at the University of California, San Francisco, with two primary institutional partners serving minority populations, the San Francisco Department of Public Health and the San Ysidro Community Health Center, a model health center located near the US-Mexican border, and additional collaborating institutions. The theme for this Center is to understand, prevent, and reduce oral health disparities among young children, with a primary focus on preventing early childhood caries. A secondary theme is to understand the interactions between the oral health and medical delivery systems that can affect children's oral health. These goals will be pursued from two primary directions: retrospective data- based projects to increase our understanding of the etiology of oral health disparities and to identify children most susceptible, and intervention projects to prevent disease. In this center we will 1) Support primarily patient and population-oriented research related to reducing oral health disparities in children; 2) Establish core facilities to provide technical services and resources to Center-affiliated projects; 3) Provide an enriched environment for training future health-care professionals and scientists, especially those from under-represented groups; 4) Establish mechanisms to increase collaboration among investigators in Center- supported projects, across health professions and affiliated collaborating public and private institutions on the west coast. Findings from this project will 1) identify cultural, environmental, workforce, behavioral, and biologic factors associated with health disparities among the ethnic/racial groups in the very diverse California environment; 2) enhance our ability to target children likely to be at risk for dental caries; 3) provide successful interdisciplinary interventions to prevent disease and reduce oral health disparities.

"Northwest/Alaska Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparity This proposal is in response to RFD DE-99-003 to establish the Northwest and Alaska Center for Oral Health Disparity for research to reduce oral health disparities in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska.  It is proposed that the Center develop basic and applied knowledge that addresses the needs of poor, minority, and rural children and their caretakers, utilizing approaches that go beyond the traditional strategies from dental public health that have not found success in these populations. While the research in the proposed center may involve traditional dental personnel, it also stresses the roles of pediatricians, mothers as well as children; and preventive agents beyond fluorides. Participants include Alaska Natives, Native Americans from the Yakima Indian Nation, Hispanics from the agricultural areas of Washington, African Americans and Hispanics from the local military reservations, Hispanics and Pacific Islanders served by urban hospitals as well as rural and low-income Whites. We propose to accomplish this goal through five specific aims: (1) To address the needs of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska by conducting clinical research to evaluate the efficacy of non- traditional interventions to prevent and treat oral disease in children and their caretakers; (2) To develop community-based research that translates existing knowledge and new information regarding children and their caretakers into new technologies and interventions that hold promise for reducing disparities in these high risk populations; (3) To expand health science education and research training opportunities for minority populations in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska by collaborations with key minority educational and health serving institutions in the region; (4) To conduct basic research to further understand the role of host defenses and genetic bases for caries and periodontal disease affect underserved populations as well as to probe the biologic basis for antibacterial that change disease susceptibility; and (5) To increase the impact of the center beyond the projects included in this proposal by recruiting investigators and students from minority institutions in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska and prioritizing and encouraging pilot and center-affiliated studies in which they are involved. The collaborating institutions and partners are Heritage College (Hispanic and Native American-serving institution sited on the Yakima Indian Nation), Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium/Yukon-Kuskokwim Native Health Corporation, Yakima Valley Farm Workers Clinic, Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board/Northwest Tribal Epidemiology Center, Washington Dental Service an Foundation (major private dental insurer); and Medical Assistance Administration (Medicaid agency for Washington State).

"Molecular Epidemiology of Dental Caries Susceptibility  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Dental caries is one of the most common diseases of childhood. It occurs in children of all socioeconomic classes and in every country around the world. In the United States, there is disparity in caries prevalence such that 80% of the caries occur in 20% of the children, primarily minority children or those from low income families. Although there is clear evidence that dental caries is a multifactorial infectious disease with many environmental contributory factors, there is also strong evidence for a host genetic component in the etiology of this disease. Currently, the most reliable predictor of a child's future risk for caries is the presence of one or more carious teeth. Other environmental factors contribute to this risk but do not provide the level of specificity needed for the targeting of effective preventive measures. The objective of this application is to screen candidate genes to identify sequence polymorphisms that occur more frequently in subjects with dental caries than in those without caries. A secondary objective is to initiate the collection of families with multiple affected children to be used for a genome scan in a future application. The central hypothesis of the application is that sequence variations in one or more candidate genes, combined with environmental factors, can be used to predict caries risk prior to the occurrence of disease. Two hundred affected children aged 3 to 4 years and age and race matched controls will be ascertained from Iowa for linkage disequilibrium studies. Families with multiple affected siblings will be ascertained whenever possible. Candidate genes will include genes involved in enamel mineralization and in salivary buffering. Collection of families will be done to facilitate future genome wide scans for caries susceptibility loci. Identification of genetic markers for dental caries will provide us with a better understanding of the caries process on an individual basis, a more reliable method to assess caries risk and will facilitate the development of targeted preventive strategies.

"Examining Disparities in Child Dental Medicaid  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The candidate is currently a fellow in Pediatric Dentistry completing a Ph.D in Health Policy Analysis with additional advanced training in health services research. She has a long established history of commitment and interest in research and academic dentistry.  This application proposes a comprehensive interdisciplinary program wherein the candidate would receive the necessary training and mentorship to develop into an independent investigator. Two phases are described. In the first phase (Scholarly Development) Dr. Lee will work under the mentorship of Dr. R. Gary Rozier and a research advisory committee to complete the first part of the study. In the second phase (Faculty Transition) the candidate will work more independently to complete the second part of the proposal and build upon this research to seek additional funding. This will assist in the transition towards becoming an independent investigator. The research component will examine disparities in access to oral health care for pre-school aged children enrolled in Medicaid.   The current level of oral health service utilization in Medicaid has presented a major public policy challenge as evident by reports from the Office of Technology Assessment, the General Accounting Office and the Office of the Surgeon General. Medicaid is the country's largest investment in improving access and decreasing oral health problems of young low-income children. It has been established that low-income, minority, rural children have a disproportionately higher level of dental disease, but very little is known about their use of and access to oral health services. This research proposal will be the first to systematically study racial and geographic disparities and their interactions with each other and Medicaid enrollment on utilization, treatment outcomes and expenditures among pre-school aged children.   Four large databases will be used: Composite birth records from 1992, Medicaid enrollment and claims files from 1992-97, and the Area Resource File. This longitudinal cohort study treats the child as the unit of analysis. The data set will contain multiple observations per child-that is one observation for each year until the fifth birthday. Panel data techniques, specifically random effects models, will be incorporated into the estimation equations. Complex and hierarchical modeling will be used in the analyses. While controlling for predisposing and enabling characteristics, we will examine disparities on different outcome measures; 1) any oral health utilization 2) extent of utilization 3) type of visit 4) avoidable hospitalizations and source of care 5) dental related Medicaid expenditures. We will also examine quality performance measures as established by the NCQA expert panel.

"The impact of dental education on health disparities Background: Attempts to reduce the startling oral health disparities in the US will only be effective and listing if oral health care providers are deeply committed and adequately prepared to actively participate in this process through effective clinical care as well as community leadership. As members of a profession in the classic sense of that term, dentists and hygienists carry a responsibility toward the public at large to insure effective oral health care for all patients in need of such care. This is, however, an ever more daunting challenge. The universities that educate future oral health care professionals are therefore obligated to adequately prepare their students for this challenge. Hypothesis: Professional dental and hygiene education inadequately prepares dentists and hygienists to realize their professional commitment towards vulnerable, marginalized, and other underserved patients through effective oral health care and community leadership. Objective: To develop, plan and formulate and interdisciplinary concerned research project aimed at the identification of curricular deficiencies, the design and subsequent assessment of innovative educational interventions, and the determination of implementation strategies. Approach: The planning grant should enable the following seven undertakings: 1. A comprehensive and detailed search and analysis of the literature. 2. A comprehensive inventory and analysis of exemplary educational activities that have been undertaken (un)successfully at dental schools and hygiene programs in the US, as well as abroad. 3. A diagnosis of educational voids that appear to contribute to oral health disparities. 4. The initial development of a conceptual and theoretical framework, incl.  ethical questions of access and social justice in oral health care, and three pedagogy of service-learning. 5. The determination of a comprehensive educational, based on the results of the preceding steps. 6.The formulation of research questions derived from the desired educational changes. 7. The design of a research implementation process and development of one or more R01 grant(s). Limitation: In principle, graduating dentists and hygienists should be competent to address the needs of any underserved patient category. However, different categories may require different provider competencies and hence different curricular innovations. In this planning grant, three different patient categories will be examined: 1. Patients with advanced Alzheimer's Disease; 2. Patients of African-American descent; and 3. Recent immigrants.

"Detroit Center for Research on Oral Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant) - The Detroit Center for Research on Oral Health Disparities aims to promote oral health and reduce disparities within the community of low-income African American children (0-5 years) and their main caregivers (14 + years) living in the City of Detroit. The driving theme of the center's research program is to identify determinants and design interventions to answer the following question: why do some low-income African American children and their main caregivers have better oral health than others who live in the same community? The proposed center will focus on studying intra-group disparities in oral health. The community based partners, the City of Detroit Department of Health (DDH) and the Voices of Detroit Initiative (VODI) have strongly supported this theme. The Center will include 3 support cores, 5 research core projects and 1 pilot study. The Center's Methodology Core will select a multistage random sample of African American families living in the poorest 39 Census Tracts in the City of Detroit. A total of 1,529 families will be sampled and interviewed in their homes. It is estimated that 994 families will be examined at community centers in year 2 (2002) funding. Based on extensive data collected by the investigative team (R01 MH58299) in Detroit, the investigators predict that 760 families will be retained by the third examination phase in year 6 (2006). The research teams will investigate the social characteristics of parents, families, and neighborhoods, that are associated with disparities in oral health (dental caries and periodontal diseases) of children and their caregivers; lead levels in saliva of children and saliva and blood (finger prick) of the main caregivers; dietary intake; and genetic, behavioral, social and bacteriologic risk factors of periodontal disease in adults. Using information from 3 core research projects, the investigators propose to develop a tailored multi-media educational intervention (Project #3), based on the transtheoretical model of behavioral change, which will be administered using a randomized controlled design in year 4 of funding, just prior to the second examination phase. Additionally, the center will evaluate the impact on access to dental care of the state-funded experiment on utilization where Medicaid children are managed like privately insured patients (Project #4). The center will support health professionals from the DDH and VODI and the University of Detroit Mercy to receive research training. Doctoral students in three programs targeting minorities in the Schools of Public health and Social Work will be offered stipends to conduct research on health disparities. All families will have access to dental care in a DDH dental clinic (funded by DDH, HRSA, Delta Dental of Michigan and VODI).

"Northwest/Alaska Cent. to Reduce Oral Health Disparities This proposal is in response to RFD DE-99-003 to establish the Northwest and Alaska Center for Oral Health Disparity for research to reduce oral health disparities in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska.  It is proposed that the Center develop basic and applied knowledge that addresses the needs of poor, minority, and rural children and their caretakers, utilizing approaches that go beyond the traditional strategies from dental public health that have not found success in these populations. While the research in the proposed center may involve traditional dental personnel, it also stresses the roles of pediatricians, mothers as well as children; and preventive agents beyond fluorides. Participants include Alaska Natives, Native Americans from the Yakima Indian Nation, Hispanics from the agricultural areas of Washington, African Americans and Hispanics from the local military reservations, Hispanics and Pacific Islanders served by urban hospitals as well as rural and low-income Whites. We propose to accomplish this goal through five specific aims: (1) To address the needs of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska by conducting clinical research to evaluate the efficacy of non- traditional interventions to prevent and treat oral disease in children and their caretakers; (2) To develop community-based research that translates existing knowledge and new information regarding children and their caretakers into new technologies and interventions that hold promise for reducing disparities in these high risk populations; (3) To expand health science education and research training opportunities for minority populations in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska by collaborations with key minority educational and health serving institutions in the region; (4) To conduct basic research to further understand the role of host defenses and genetic bases for caries and periodontal disease affect underserved populations as well as to probe the biologic basis for antibacterial that change disease susceptibility; and (5) To increase the impact of the center beyond the projects included in this proposal by recruiting investigators and students from minority institutions in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska and prioritizing and encouraging pilot and center-affiliated studies in which they are involved. The collaborating institutions and partners are Heritage College (Hispanic and Native American-serving institution sited on the Yakima Indian Nation), Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium/Yukon-Kuskokwim Native Health Corporation, Yakima Valley Farm Workers Clinic, Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board/Northwest Tribal Epidemiology Center, Washington Dental Service an Foundation (major private dental insurer); and Medical Assistance Administration (Medicaid agency for Washington State).

"Longitudinal oral health outcomes in high-risk adults   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing renewal application         for a prospective study of oral health and dental care called the Florida            Dental Care Study (FDCS). The FDCS sample is diverse, including many subjects        at increased risk for oral health disparities (e.g., Blacks, persons of low          socioeconomic status (SES), irregular dental attenders). So far, we have tested      important hypotheses about the relationship between dental disease measured          clinically, self-reported dimensions of oral health, health-related quality of       life, and use of dental care. The FDCS has been highly productive, with many         novel findings, and logistically successful (e.g., low attrition). However,          despite 40 journal articles/manuscripts so far, an historical opportunity            exists to capitalize on a unique database that is unprecedented in adult oral        health disparities research, oral epidemiology, and dental health services           research. As a result of our proposed new focus in this application on health        disparities, we expect that many of the yet-to-be-analyzed findings will             ultimately be judged to be among the most important from the study. Therefore,       having recently completed 72 months of data collection, we request funding for       two final years focused on oral health disparities.                                                                                                                       Building upon knowledge gained so far, we now refine and extend our aims to          test five key hypotheses about the incidence and chronicity of oral health           disparities, as well as the role that incidence of specific dental services          plays in oral health disparities. ""Disparity"" will be defined as an oral health      decrement whose incidence or chronicity is significantly higher in the               high-risk groups of interest (Blacks, lower SES persons, and irregular               attenders). This research will quantify what benefits, or lack thereof, groups       at risk for oral health disparities perceive as being derived from their use of      dental care, and how this perception affects their use of it.

"Rochester Collaborative to Reduce Oral Health Dispariti*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The partnership of Eastman Dental Center with the City of Rochester and Rochester City Schools to prevent or reduce disparities in oral health began in 1915 with a gift from George Eastman enabling the creation of the Rochester Dental Dispensary. Today, that partnership extends to the University of Rochester Medical Center, including the School of Medicine and Dentistry. However, despite this rich history of collaboration and an extensive network of community-based oral health facilities, fewer than 30% of children from the most impoverished neighborhoods in the city receive regular oral health care. Further, little is known about disparities in oral diseases or dentofacial disorders among Rochester-dwelling Hispanic families from Puerto Rico and Central America. On the basis of regularly scheduled oral health surveys of Rochester school children, a comprehensive database on the distribution of dental caries has been compiled. However, little data on caries prevalence or incidence by race or ethnic group are available. Similarly, while we know that fewer than 30% of Medicaid eligible Rochester children utilize oral health care services, there are no data on barriers to utilization of the abundant and conveniently located neighborhood and school-based oral health care facilities, nor have effective interventions been developed to improve utilization. Little attention has been given to cultural and behavioral characteristics of minorities that may profoundly influence utilization. Given the rich infrastructure and abundant resources available to us, we have formed a community partnership and a multidisciplinary research collaborative to undertake research on preventing or reducing oral health disparities. In this proposal, we describe three specific aims to: 1) organize research teams; 2) link research and community partners; and 3) refine research questions and design studies that will address the following four lines of research: 1) Assess the distribution of oral disease/disorders, with emphasis on dental caries; investigate factors associated with any excess morbidity observed in Rochester-dwelling Hispanic children and contrast findings with matched cohorts of African-American and Caucasian children; 2) Determine the impact of existing oral health care programs on disparities in oral disease morbidity; 3) Identify barriers to effective utilization of the oral health care system; and, 4) Develop intervention strategies that will prevent or reduce disparities in both the levels of oral diseases as well as in access to, and effective utilization of, the oral health care system.         ",Rochester Collaborative to Reduce Oral Health Dispariti*,6588629,R21DE015004,"['dental caries ', ' oral health ', ' dental research ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' health care service utilization ', ' health care service availability ', ' human morbidity ', ' health behavior ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' socioeconomics ', ' community ', ' culture ', ' children ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R21,2002,157500,0.35417541509734507
"Periodontal Disease in Diabetic Women with Preterm Birth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This pilot proposal is in response to an RFA to Prevent or Reduce Oral Health Disparities and seeks to establish a collaborative study partnering the periodontal and molecular epidemiology expertise at the University of North Carolina School of Dentistry with the Obstetrics/Gynecology expertise at the University of Hawaii School of Medicine to examine the role of periodontal disease in pre-term deliveries among pregnant diabetic Asian & Pacific Islander (API) women.  This is an understudied minority population with a high prevalence of both diabetes and pre-term delivery. Periodontal disease is an oral infection that is more severe among diabetics and also increases insulin resistance among diabetics.  Periodontitis also is associated with increased risk for pre-term delivery, pre-term premature rupture of membranes and growth restriction. Diabetes among pregnant women is a risk factor for both pre-term delivery and macrosomia. Thus, we seek to examine whether periodontal infection among diabetic women may provide some contribution to the observed high rate of pre-term delivery among API diabetics. Specifically, this proposal seeks to conduct a pilot case-control study to determine the extent of periodontal disease in API diabetic (Type 1, Type 2 or gestational) and non-diabetic women who have term and pre-term deliveries (<37 weeks gestational age). Approximately 92 diabetic and 92 non-diabetic pre-term delivery API mothers and 184 diabetic and 184 non-diabetic term delivery API mothers will be studied (frequency matched on race 1 case: 2 controls). Full-mouth periodontal examinations will be performed using standardized methods and calibrated examiners. Preliminary data will be generated by analyzing fetal cord blood for markers of fetal exposure to oral pathogens of maternal origin, as indexed by bacterial-specific fetal IgM levels and fetal stress as reflected by slCAM and CRP levels. In addition a subset of fetal membranes will be analyzed for protein expression of IL-lb, TNFa and IL-6 by ELISAs and MMP-8 mRNA by Northerns. Pilot data will be generated to support an R01 application that will originate from the U of H (a minority institution) with Dr. Millar as PI, to test the hypothesis that periodontitis is more extensive among API diabetic women and associated with higher rate of fetal exposure to oral pathogens than among non-diabetics and that the prevalence of periodontal disease and frequency of fetal exposure is higher among pre-term deliveries for both diabetics and non-diabetics, as compared to term deliveries. In this collaboration UNC will also provide the U of H study personnel the periodontal and molecular epidemiology research training and experience needed in multi-disciplinary studies of periodontal disease and obstetrics to conduct the planned R01 application.         ",Periodontal Disease in Diabetic Women with Preterm Birth,6587992,R21DE014984,"['premature infant human ', ' cooperative study ', ' periodontium disorder ', ' gestational diabetes mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ', ' noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' immunoglobulin M ', ' human pregnant subject ', ' interleukin 1 ', ' interleukin 6 ', ' tumor necrosis factor alpha ', ' enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ', ' messenger RNA ', ' epidemiology ', ' premature labor ', ' gestational age ', ' postpartum ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' embryo /fetus membrane ', ' bacterial protein ', ' female ', ' Asian ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' northern blotting ', ' clinical research ', ' cord blood ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2002,173339,0.09345325295830624
"Study Plans of Communication and Oral Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal for a planning grant to develop research approaches to discover whether dentist-patient communication leads to disparities in the prevalence of caries and periodontal disease in African American and Hispanic patients, and to identify testable methods to improve communication to avoid or alleviate those disparities. The specific aims are: Aim One: To create a research team and form an Advisory Board for the development of research plans, and to obtain training for the team. Aim Two: To look for methods of studying the effect of dental team communication on caries and periodontal disease of Hispanic and African American dental school patients. Aim Three: To determine what methods promote compliance and good communication between practitioners and Hispanic and African American patients, to identify training methods for the dental team, and to develop evaluation protocols to test the methods that can be used to apply for pilot funding or R01 funding, as appropriate. If dental teams are more likely to alienate or fail to make an effective working relationship with African American or Hispanic patients than with White patients, then they are less likely to obtain important information from that patient, they are less likely to have a positive influence on the patient's dental attendance or home care behavior, and they are less likely to convince the patient of the appropriate treatment plan. This is especially true if the treatment plan consists of regimens that require specific patient behaviors, such as plaque control programs. The methods to be used are 1) literature searches to identify variables and methods, 2) interviews and focus groups with patients, dental students, dental hygiene students, faculty and dental school staff to uncover potential difficulties and assure that important areas are identified, 3) an advisory board to review and advise about potential difficulties with the measures and methods, identify areas that should be explored, and to review the value of proposed research plans, 4) consultation and training with experts in measuring communication and in teaching cultural competence, and 5) statistical advice on measurement and analyses. A two year plan is proposed with the expectation of producing several research proposals aimed at both measuring the effect of doctor-patient communication on disparities and evaluating training methods to help dental providers communicate better with minorities.         ",Study Plans of Communication and Oral Health Disparities,6587988,R21DE014991,"['dental caries ', ' periodontium disorder ', ' oral health ', ' dentistry ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' dentistry education ', ' teaching ', ' training ', ' patient care personnel relations ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' health behavior ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' culture ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' communication ', ' medically underserved population ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R21,2002,155870,0.1449992100103823
"Conference on Closing the Gap in Hispanics' Oral Health  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a request for co-funding of a two day conference titled ""Closing the Gap in Oral Health Disparities Affecting Hispanics: Strategies for a National Oral Health Plan"". This conference will be conducted in conjunction with the 10th Annual Meeting of the Hispanic Dental Association (HDA). It is a follow up to last year's NIDCR's sponsored conference: ""Oral Health Disparities and the Hispanic Population: A Framework for Action in Response to the Surgeon General's Report"". The overarching aim of this conference is to present and further develop specific strategies and action plans to reduce disparities in oral health affecting the Hispanic population in the US. The conference will consist of five major themes: 1) Keynote Speech (Dr. Dushanka V. Kleinman): the National Oral Health Plan; 2) Health Communications/Health Literacy: Delivering the Message; 3) Integration of Oral Health Care into Primary Care; 4) Legislative Measures to Close the Gap; 5) Advances in Craniofacial and Oral Health Disease Prevention and Treatment. Based on last year's meeting and in follow up meetings of the HDA Board of Trustees, this conference will focus on strategies that were deemed to be of utmost importance to eliminate oral health disparities in the Hispanic population: 1) partner with governmental agencies in the development of the  National Oral Health Plan; 2) invest and promote the development, testing and implementation of health literacy programs; 3) advocate for the integration of oral health care into primary care, 4) develop legislation and advocate for measures to increase access to care and 5) disseminate research findings that can help prevent and treat oral health conditions more effectively. The HDA endeavors to foster partnerships with other Hispanic health care organizations, the NIDCR and other governmental agencies as well as policy makers to help eliminate disparities in oral health among the Hispanic population in the US. It is expected that the conference will have the following outcomes: a) energize and motivate the HDA membership to utilize the presented strategies to advocate, legislate, educate, develop research strategies and utilize clinical findings to close the gap in oral health disparities among the US Hispanic population; b) disseminate the findings and discussion by publishing the proceedings in a peer reviewed journal and c) the formation of workgroup composed of private practitioners, educators, researchers and students that will develop in collaboration with other agencies and organizations, the National Oral Health Plan and other similar planning documents. This conference will support the NIDCR Strategic Plan to Eliminate Craniofacial, Oral and Dental Health Disparities as well as the HDA mission: to provide leadership and represent oral health professionals who share a common commitment to improve the oral health of the Hispanic community.

"Longitudinal study of caries in a rural WIC population    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the prevalence of dental caries has declined for the majority of U.S. children in recent decades, there are profound disparities in dental caries experience where young children from low-income or minority families suffer a disproportionate share of the disease burden. To effectively address the problem of caries in the primary dentition of high-risk children, preventive efforts should be directed at these children beginning at a very early age. The WIC supplemental nutritional program is one of the very few programs that serves children at very young ages, and it also serves children from low-income families. However, there are limited data available about the oral health of WIC-enrolled populations, and studies have not longitudinally followed subjects in such a population. Thus, the goals for the proposed study are to longitudinally track caries experience in WIC-enrolled children; to assess methods to enhance subject recruitment and retention in these populations and to gather longitudinal caries risk data on WIC populations. We will also explore how S. mutans clonal types change over time, as well as how they interact with host genetic markers and predict caries development in these high-risk young children.  Specifically, the study will follow a cohort of WIC-enrolled 1-year-old children for 18 months in Muscatine and Louisa counties in Iowa - two rural counties with large Hispanic populations. Collection of pilot data in this population will allow our research team and others to continue research aimed at reducing oral health disparities, including longitudinal trials of preventive interventions. Moreover, interventions centered at WIC programs have the potential to become sustainable caries-prevention programs for high-risk children throughout the country. We will collect data on caries occurrence, beverage consumption, fluoride exposures, S. mutans levels and clonal type, and host genetic markers, and we will assess different methods of recruiting and retaining subjects in this high-risk population. Data from this pilot study will be of great value and will position the study team to effectively conduct future intervention studies to reduce oral health disparities.         ",Longitudinal study of caries in a rural WIC population,6588324,R21DE015008,"['Streptococcus mutans ', ' infant human (0-1 year) ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' dental caries ', ' dental plaque ', ' oral health ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' beverage ', ' genetic marker ', ' fluorine ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' human subject ', ' data collection ', ' oral bacteria ', ' saliva ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' low income ', ' rural area ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' clinical research ', ' bacteria infection mechanism ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2002,183854,0.22160207623145556
"Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health A Center Addressing Disparities in Children's Oral Health is proposed at the University of California, San Francisco, with two primary institutional partners serving minority populations, the San Francisco Department of Public Health and the San Ysidro Community Health Center, a model health center located near the US-Mexican border, and additional collaborating institutions. The theme for this Center is to understand, prevent, and reduce oral health disparities among young children, with a primary focus on preventing early childhood caries. A secondary theme is to understand the interactions between the oral health and medical delivery systems that can affect children's oral health. These goals will be pursued from two primary directions: retrospective data- based projects to increase our understanding of the etiology of oral health disparities and to identify children most susceptible, and intervention projects to prevent disease. In this center we will 1) Support primarily patient and population-oriented research related to reducing oral health disparities in children; 2) Establish core facilities to provide technical services and resources to Center-affiliated projects; 3) Provide an enriched environment for training future health-care professionals and scientists, especially those from under-represented groups; 4) Establish mechanisms to increase collaboration among investigators in Center- supported projects, across health professions and affiliated collaborating public and private institutions on the west coast. Findings from this project will 1) identify cultural, environmental, workforce, behavioral, and biologic factors associated with health disparities among the ethnic/racial groups in the very diverse California environment; 2) enhance our ability to target children likely to be at risk for dental caries; 3) provide successful interdisciplinary interventions to prevent disease and reduce oral health disparities.

"NYU Oral Cancer RAAHP Center This proposed NYU Oral Cancer Research for Adolescent and Adult Health Promotion (RAAHP) Center is a P50 Center which was designed in response to the NIDCR request for applications for Centers for Research to Reduce Oral Health Disparities (RFA:DE-99-003). The overall goal of this proposed NY Oral Cancer RAAHP Center is to conduct studies and promote activities that will reduce oral disparities in the United States. While oral cancer occurs in all segments of the U.S. population, oral cancer rates (both incidence and mortality) are highest among minority populations, especially in African Americans and in Hispanics. Specifically, this proposed Center will, as stated in the RFA, support research ""that will lead to an understanding of the factors associated with health disparities as well as to the support and development, testing and evaluation of interventions designed to reduce [oral cancer] disparities"". The Specific Aims of the overall Center are: 1) to conduct a set of five major studies, as fully described in this grant application; 2) to design and conduct a sixth major study on oral cancer in the theme of this Center; 3.) to stimulate and support the design, writing and submission of Developmental 'Spin-Off'; 4.) to stimulate and support the development, selection, funding and implementation of two types of pilot research studies: bioethics and scientific pilot studies; 5.) to maintain three Cores (Administrative, Informatics, and Biostatistics) that will support the scientific activities of all the investigators in this proposed Center; 6) to develop and implement a full set of intra-Center research training and career development activities which focus on creating opportunities for scientists from underrepresented groups within the scientific workforce; 7) to participate fully in inter-Center national research and training networks; 8) to serve as an intellectual and administrative nidus to stimulate oral cancer research interests, discussions, and planning sessions among Center participants as well as among other cancer research colleagues; and 9) to provide information and findings on oral cancer to community involved health service units.

"A LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF LEAD EXPOSURE AND DENTAL CARIES The long-term goal of our research is to elucidate underlying mechanisms by which the physical and social environments result in health disparities.  Our previous work has shown that the hypothesis that lead exposure is a risk factor for dental caries is plausible and could have significant public health impact, especially for individuals in impoverished circumstances (Watson et al., 1997; Moss et al., 1999). We will study dental caries risk due to environmental lead exposure in a birth cohort of 245 Cincinnati children that have been participants in the Cincinnati Lead Cohort Study since late 1979.  The on-going study of 15-16 year-olds is currently in its third year of funding (R01 ES08158, Early Exposure to Lead and Adolescent Development, P.I.: K. Dietrich).  This group of African-American and white Appalachian children is arguably the most well-described longitudinal cohort ever studied for prenatal and postnatal lead exposure (prenatal maternal blood lead concentration, neonatal blood lead concentration, quarterly assessments of the concentration of lead in blood from birth to 5 years and semi-annually thereafter).  This cohort is unique among the major longitudinal studies of lead and child health in that a substantial number of subjects were exposed to clinically significant levels of lead during early development.  Peak lead exposure in this cohort ranges from 5 to over 80 micrograms/dL. We will collect additional data specifically related to dental caries risk and perform laboratory microanalytic assessments of lead in plaque and enamel.  This will allow us to test a series of hypotheses that relate environmental lead exposure to risk for dental caries development in adolescents. The work of this project will focus on four specific aims related to 1) Demonstrating the strength of the association between environmental lead exposure and risk for dental caries and ruling out alternative explanations; 2) Assessing the utility of permanent tooth enamel, deciduous tooth enamel, deciduous tooth dentin and supragingival plaque as biomarkers for lead exposure using microanalytic techniques; 3) Testing mechanistic hypotheses that show lead exposure a) reduces salivary gland function; b) acts as an effect modifer to reduce the protective effect of salivary fluoride; c) is most strongly linked to caries when measured during enamel formation; 4) Exploring more broadly the basis for oral disease disparities in disadvantaged groups by examining the interplay of lead, nutrition, and social factors.

"CHILD ORAL HEALTH QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE  Applicant's Description: Treatment of children with oral and oro-facial              conditions is based on broadly accepted standards tied to the evaluation of          clinical parameters. However, little is known about treatment success - whether      the desired clinical outcomes related to treatment are achieved or whether           patients are satisfied with their treatment outcomes. Research in this area is       limited by a lack of valid, reliable and culturally sensitive instruments to         assess perceived outcomes of care for children and their families. To address        this deficiency, the study will develop a culturally sensitive instrument, the       Child Oral and Oro-Facial Questionnaire (COOFQ) to assess the Oral                   Health-Related Quality of Life (OHROOL) in children across Oral and Oro-Facial       conditions. The instrument will consist of a family of questionnaires; a             Primary Caregiver Perceptions Questionnaire (PCPQ) and age-specific Child            Perceptions Questionnaires (CPQ). The former will tap caregiver (predominantly       parent) perceptions of the child's OHRQOL and the impact of the child's              condition on the family, while the latter will tap the child's perception of         the impact of the condition on his/her well-being and daily life. To address         age-appropriate developmental tasks, age-specific questionnaires are necessary       for children to accommodate age-related changes in children's emotional and          cognitive development. This study is the initial phase of a multi-stage effort       to create three age-appropriate questionnaires for children and will develop a       questionnaire for 10-14 year olds and their caregivers. Because of the greater       complexities associated with the development of questionnaires for younger           children, analogous questionnaires will be developed for children aged 3-5 and       6-9 years at a later date. Children and parents from multiple clinical sites in      two North American locations will be recruited to develop a psychometrically         sound instrument to measure OHRQOL. Specific ethnic groups (African American,        Hispanic, Asians, and Whites) will be recruited to assess the cultural               appropriateness of the questionnaires. This proposal is concerned with the           development of these questionnaires and the assessment of their performance as       discriminatory instruments. Data from this study will provide insight and            preliminary data to develop substantive hypotheses in clinical trials with           pediatric dental patients across a variety of conditions. The ultimate aim of        this instrument is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of services           delivered to pediatric dental patients. The PCPQ and the CPQ will help to            measure the burden of pediatric oral and oro-facial disorders in general             populations, population subgroups and groups of patients, and to evaluate the        effectiveness of pediatric oral care services. Given the disparities in health       status across ethnic groups and SES as well as the thrust to ration health           costs, examining the impact of oral health conditions is essential in                developing health policy.

"Periodontal Disease in Diabetic Women with Preterm Birth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This pilot proposal is in response to an RFA to Prevent or Reduce Oral Health Disparities and seeks to establish a collaborative study partnering the periodontal and molecular epidemiology expertise at the University of North Carolina School of Dentistry with the Obstetrics/Gynecology expertise at the University of Hawaii School of Medicine to examine the role of periodontal disease in pre-term deliveries among pregnant diabetic Asian & Pacific Islander (API) women.  This is an understudied minority population with a high prevalence of both diabetes and pre-term delivery. Periodontal disease is an oral infection that is more severe among diabetics and also increases insulin resistance among diabetics.  Periodontitis also is associated with increased risk for pre-term delivery, pre-term premature rupture of membranes and growth restriction. Diabetes among pregnant women is a risk factor for both pre-term delivery and macrosomia. Thus, we seek to examine whether periodontal infection among diabetic women may provide some contribution to the observed high rate of pre-term delivery among API diabetics. Specifically, this proposal seeks to conduct a pilot case-control study to determine the extent of periodontal disease in API diabetic (Type 1, Type 2 or gestational) and non-diabetic women who have term and pre-term deliveries (<37 weeks gestational age). Approximately 92 diabetic and 92 non-diabetic pre-term delivery API mothers and 184 diabetic and 184 non-diabetic term delivery API mothers will be studied (frequency matched on race 1 case: 2 controls). Full-mouth periodontal examinations will be performed using standardized methods and calibrated examiners. Preliminary data will be generated by analyzing fetal cord blood for markers of fetal exposure to oral pathogens of maternal origin, as indexed by bacterial-specific fetal IgM levels and fetal stress as reflected by slCAM and CRP levels. In addition a subset of fetal membranes will be analyzed for protein expression of IL-lb, TNFa and IL-6 by ELISAs and MMP-8 mRNA by Northerns. Pilot data will be generated to support an R01 application that will originate from the U of H (a minority institution) with Dr. Millar as PI, to test the hypothesis that periodontitis is more extensive among API diabetic women and associated with higher rate of fetal exposure to oral pathogens than among non-diabetics and that the prevalence of periodontal disease and frequency of fetal exposure is higher among pre-term deliveries for both diabetics and non-diabetics, as compared to term deliveries. In this collaboration UNC will also provide the U of H study personnel the periodontal and molecular epidemiology research training and experience needed in multi-disciplinary studies of periodontal disease and obstetrics to conduct the planned R01 application.         ",Periodontal Disease in Diabetic Women with Preterm Birth,6661366,R21DE014984,"['premature infant human ', ' cooperative study ', ' periodontium disorder ', ' gestational diabetes mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ', ' noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' immunoglobulin M ', ' human pregnant subject ', ' interleukin 1 ', ' interleukin 6 ', ' tumor necrosis factor alpha ', ' enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ', ' messenger RNA ', ' epidemiology ', ' premature labor ', ' gestational age ', ' postpartum ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' embryo /fetus membrane ', ' bacterial protein ', ' female ', ' Asian ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' northern blotting ', ' clinical research ', ' cord blood ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2003,162442,0.09345325295830624
"Longitudinal oral health outcomes in high-risk adults   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing renewal application         for a prospective study of oral health and dental care called the Florida            Dental Care Study (FDCS). The FDCS sample is diverse, including many subjects        at increased risk for oral health disparities (e.g., Blacks, persons of low          socioeconomic status (SES), irregular dental attenders). So far, we have tested      important hypotheses about the relationship between dental disease measured          clinically, self-reported dimensions of oral health, health-related quality of       life, and use of dental care. The FDCS has been highly productive, with many         novel findings, and logistically successful (e.g., low attrition). However,          despite 40 journal articles/manuscripts so far, an historical opportunity            exists to capitalize on a unique database that is unprecedented in adult oral        health disparities research, oral epidemiology, and dental health services           research. As a result of our proposed new focus in this application on health        disparities, we expect that many of the yet-to-be-analyzed findings will             ultimately be judged to be among the most important from the study. Therefore,       having recently completed 72 months of data collection, we request funding for       two final years focused on oral health disparities.                                                                                                                       Building upon knowledge gained so far, we now refine and extend our aims to          test five key hypotheses about the incidence and chronicity of oral health           disparities, as well as the role that incidence of specific dental services          plays in oral health disparities. ""Disparity"" will be defined as an oral health      decrement whose incidence or chronicity is significantly higher in the               high-risk groups of interest (Blacks, lower SES persons, and irregular               attenders). This research will quantify what benefits, or lack thereof, groups       at risk for oral health disparities perceive as being derived from their use of      dental care, and how this perception affects their use of it.

"Study Plans of Communication and Oral Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal for a planning grant to develop research approaches to discover whether dentist-patient communication leads to disparities in the prevalence of caries and periodontal disease in African American and Hispanic patients, and to identify testable methods to improve communication to avoid or alleviate those disparities. The specific aims are: Aim One: To create a research team and form an Advisory Board for the development of research plans, and to obtain training for the team. Aim Two: To look for methods of studying the effect of dental team communication on caries and periodontal disease of Hispanic and African American dental school patients. Aim Three: To determine what methods promote compliance and good communication between practitioners and Hispanic and African American patients, to identify training methods for the dental team, and to develop evaluation protocols to test the methods that can be used to apply for pilot funding or R01 funding, as appropriate. If dental teams are more likely to alienate or fail to make an effective working relationship with African American or Hispanic patients than with White patients, then they are less likely to obtain important information from that patient, they are less likely to have a positive influence on the patient's dental attendance or home care behavior, and they are less likely to convince the patient of the appropriate treatment plan. This is especially true if the treatment plan consists of regimens that require specific patient behaviors, such as plaque control programs. The methods to be used are 1) literature searches to identify variables and methods, 2) interviews and focus groups with patients, dental students, dental hygiene students, faculty and dental school staff to uncover potential difficulties and assure that important areas are identified, 3) an advisory board to review and advise about potential difficulties with the measures and methods, identify areas that should be explored, and to review the value of proposed research plans, 4) consultation and training with experts in measuring communication and in teaching cultural competence, and 5) statistical advice on measurement and analyses.

"Molecular Epidemiology of Dental Caries Susceptibility  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Dental caries is one of the most common diseases of childhood. It occurs in children of all socioeconomic classes and in every country around the world. In the United States, there is disparity in caries prevalence such that 80% of the caries occur in 20% of the children, primarily minority children or those from low income families. Although there is clear evidence that dental caries is a multifactorial infectious disease with many environmental contributory factors, there is also strong evidence for a host genetic component in the etiology of this disease. Currently, the most reliable predictor of a child's future risk for caries is the presence of one or more carious teeth. Other environmental factors contribute to this risk but do not provide the level of specificity needed for the targeting of effective preventive measures. The objective of this application is to screen candidate genes to identify sequence polymorphisms that occur more frequently in subjects with dental caries than in those without caries. A secondary objective is to initiate the collection of families with multiple affected children to be used for a genome scan in a future application. The central hypothesis of the application is that sequence variations in one or more candidate genes, combined with environmental factors, can be used to predict caries risk prior to the occurrence of disease. Two hundred affected children aged 3 to 4 years and age and race matched controls will be ascertained from Iowa for linkage disequilibrium studies. Families with multiple affected siblings will be ascertained whenever possible. Candidate genes will include genes involved in enamel mineralization and in salivary buffering. Collection of families will be done to facilitate future genome wide scans for caries susceptibility loci. Identification of genetic markers for dental caries will provide us with a better understanding of the caries process on an individual basis, a more reliable method to assess caries risk and will facilitate the development of targeted preventive strategies.

"Longitudinal study of caries in a rural WIC population    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the prevalence of dental caries has declined for the majority of U.S. children in recent decades, there are profound disparities in dental caries experience where young children from low-income or minority families suffer a disproportionate share of the disease burden. To effectively address the problem of caries in the primary dentition of high-risk children, preventive efforts should be directed at these children beginning at a very early age. The WIC supplemental nutritional program is one of the very few programs that serves children at very young ages, and it also serves children from low-income families. However, there are limited data available about the oral health of WIC-enrolled populations, and studies have not longitudinally followed subjects in such a population. Thus, the goals for the proposed study are to longitudinally track caries experience in WIC-enrolled children; to assess methods to enhance subject recruitment and retention in these populations and to gather longitudinal caries risk data on WIC populations. We will also explore how S. mutans clonal types change over time, as well as how they interact with host genetic markers and predict caries development in these high-risk young children.  Specifically, the study will follow a cohort of WIC-enrolled 1-year-old children for 18 months in Muscatine and Louisa counties in Iowa - two rural counties with large Hispanic populations. Collection of pilot data in this population will allow our research team and others to continue research aimed at reducing oral health disparities, including longitudinal trials of preventive interventions. Moreover, interventions centered at WIC programs have the potential to become sustainable caries-prevention programs for high-risk children throughout the country. We will collect data on caries occurrence, beverage consumption, fluoride exposures, S. mutans levels and clonal type, and host genetic markers, and we will assess different methods of recruiting and retaining subjects in this high-risk population. Data from this pilot study will be of great value and will position the study team to effectively conduct future intervention studies to reduce oral health disparities.         ",Longitudinal study of caries in a rural WIC population,6661292,R21DE015008,"['Streptococcus mutans ', ' infant human (0-1 year) ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' dental caries ', ' dental plaque ', ' oral health ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' beverage ', ' genetic marker ', ' fluorine ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' human subject ', ' data collection ', ' oral bacteria ', ' saliva ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' low income ', ' rural area ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' clinical research ', ' bacteria infection mechanism ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2003,184375,0.22160207623145556
"Longitudinal oral health outcomes in high-risk adults   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing renewal application         for a prospective study of oral health and dental care called the Florida            Dental Care Study (FDCS). The FDCS sample is diverse, including many subjects        at increased risk for oral health disparities (e.g., Blacks, persons of low          socioeconomic status (SES), irregular dental attenders). So far, we have tested      important hypotheses about the relationship between dental disease measured          clinically, self-reported dimensions of oral health, health-related quality of       life, and use of dental care. The FDCS has been highly productive, with many         novel findings, and logistically successful (e.g., low attrition). However,          despite 40 journal articles/manuscripts so far, an historical opportunity            exists to capitalize on a unique database that is unprecedented in adult oral        health disparities research, oral epidemiology, and dental health services           research. As a result of our proposed new focus in this application on health        disparities, we expect that many of the yet-to-be-analyzed findings will             ultimately be judged to be among the most important from the study. Therefore,       having recently completed 72 months of data collection, we request funding for       two final years focused on oral health disparities.                                                                                                                       Building upon knowledge gained so far, we now refine and extend our aims to          test five key hypotheses about the incidence and chronicity of oral health           disparities, as well as the role that incidence of specific dental services          plays in oral health disparities. ""Disparity"" will be defined as an oral health      decrement whose incidence or chronicity is significantly higher in the               high-risk groups of interest (Blacks, lower SES persons, and irregular               attenders). This research will quantify what benefits, or lack thereof, groups       at risk for oral health disparities perceive as being derived from their use of      dental care, and how this perception affects their use of it.

"ORAL HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE DESCRIPTION: The goal of the proposed research training plan for Noelle Huntington is to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to become an independent researcher in children?s oral health. The fulfillment of this goal will occur in two phases. The focus of phase one is the relationship between psychosocial factors and oral health outcomes in adults, and will be investigated through secondary analysis of data from the VA Dental Longitudinal Study (DLS) and Normative Aging Study (NAS). Two sets of questions will be addressed. The first concerns the relationship between three oral health constructs - clinical status, self-report of status, and oral health-related quality of life. The second set of questions concerns the disparity in oral health outcomes by socioeconomic condition. It is hypothesized that factors secondary to socioeconomic condition (e.g., insurance, access) serve as mediators between SES and oral health. Theory-based models of these relationships will be designed and tested using DLS and NAS data, including models of change in oral health status following changes in socioeconomic or mediating variables. The second phase will serve as an orientation to the area of children?s oral health research through the guided development and testing of a measure of oral health-related quality of life in children. This measure will then be used to facilitate future research in oral health-related quality of life, beyond the period covered by this fellowship.

"Vision Awards for GM Lead Users Group A Center Addressing Disparities in Children's Oral Health is proposed at the University of California, San Francisco, with two primary institutional partners serving minority populations, the San Francisco Department of Public Health and the San Ysidro Community Health Center, a model health center located near the US-Mexican border, and additional collaborating institutions. The theme for this Center is to understand, prevent, and reduce oral health disparities among young children, with a primary focus on preventing early childhood caries. A secondary theme is to understand the interactions between the oral health and medical delivery systems that can affect children's oral health. These goals will be pursued from two primary directions: retrospective data- based projects to increase our understanding of the etiology of oral health disparities and to identify children most susceptible, and intervention projects to prevent disease. In this center we will 1) Support primarily patient and population-oriented research related to reducing oral health disparities in children; 2) Establish core facilities to provide technical services and resources to Center-affiliated projects; 3) Provide an enriched environment for training future health-care professionals and scientists, especially those from under-represented groups; 4) Establish mechanisms to increase collaboration among investigators in Center- supported projects, across health professions and affiliated collaborating public and private institutions on the west coast. Findings from this project will 1) identify cultural, environmental, workforce, behavioral, and biologic factors associated with health disparities among the ethnic/racial groups in the very diverse California environment; 2) enhance our ability to target children likely to be at risk for dental caries; 3) provide successful interdisciplinary interventions to prevent disease and reduce oral health disparities.

"Detroit Center for Research on Oral Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant) - The Detroit Center for Research on Oral Health Disparities aims to promote oral health and reduce disparities within the community of low-income African American children (0-5 years) and their main caregivers (14 + years) living in the City of Detroit. The driving theme of the center's research program is to identify determinants and design interventions to answer the following question: why do some low-income African American children and their main caregivers have better oral health than others who live in the same community? The proposed center will focus on studying intra-group disparities in oral health. The community based partners, the City of Detroit Department of Health (DDH) and the Voices of Detroit Initiative (VODI) have strongly supported this theme. The Center will include 3 support cores, 5 research core projects and 1 pilot study. The Center's Methodology Core will select a multistage random sample of African American families living in the poorest 39 Census Tracts in the City of Detroit. A total of 1,529 families will be sampled and interviewed in their homes. It is estimated that 994 families will be examined at community centers in year 2 (2002) funding. Based on extensive data collected by the investigative team (R01 MH58299) in Detroit, the investigators predict that 760 families will be retained by the third examination phase in year 6 (2006). The research teams will investigate the social characteristics of parents, families, and neighborhoods, that are associated with disparities in oral health (dental caries and periodontal diseases) of children and their caregivers; lead levels in saliva of children and saliva and blood (finger prick) of the main caregivers; dietary intake; and genetic, behavioral, social and bacteriologic risk factors of periodontal disease in adults. Using information from 3 core research projects, the investigators propose to develop a tailored multi-media educational intervention (Project #3), based on the transtheoretical model of behavioral change, which will be administered using a randomized controlled design in year 4 of funding, just prior to the second examination phase. Additionally, the center will evaluate the impact on access to dental care of the state-funded experiment on utilization where Medicaid children are managed like privately insured patients (Project #4). The center will support health professionals from the DDH and VODI and the University of Detroit Mercy to receive research training. Doctoral students in three programs targeting minorities in the Schools of Public health and Social Work will be offered stipends to conduct research on health disparities. All families will have access to dental care in a DDH dental clinic (funded by DDH, HRSA, Delta Dental of Michigan and VODI).

"Northwest/Alaska Cent. to Reduce Oral Health Disparities This proposal is in response to RFD DE-99-003 to establish the Northwest and Alaska Center for Oral Health Disparity for research to reduce oral health disparities in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska.  It is proposed that the Center develop basic and applied knowledge that addresses the needs of poor, minority, and rural children and their caretakers, utilizing approaches that go beyond the traditional strategies from dental public health that have not found success in these populations. While the research in the proposed center may involve traditional dental personnel, it also stresses the roles of pediatricians, mothers as well as children; and preventive agents beyond fluorides. Participants include Alaska Natives, Native Americans from the Yakima Indian Nation, Hispanics from the agricultural areas of Washington, African Americans and Hispanics from the local military reservations, Hispanics and Pacific Islanders served by urban hospitals as well as rural and low-income Whites. We propose to accomplish this goal through five specific aims: (1) To address the needs of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska by conducting clinical research to evaluate the efficacy of non- traditional interventions to prevent and treat oral disease in children and their caretakers; (2) To develop community-based research that translates existing knowledge and new information regarding children and their caretakers into new technologies and interventions that hold promise for reducing disparities in these high risk populations; (3) To expand health science education and research training opportunities for minority populations in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska by collaborations with key minority educational and health serving institutions in the region; (4) To conduct basic research to further understand the role of host defenses and genetic bases for caries and periodontal disease affect underserved populations as well as to probe the biologic basis for antibacterial that change disease susceptibility; and (5) To increase the impact of the center beyond the projects included in this proposal by recruiting investigators and students from minority institutions in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska and prioritizing and encouraging pilot and center-affiliated studies in which they are involved. The collaborating institutions and partners are Heritage College (Hispanic and Native American-serving institution sited on the Yakima Indian Nation), Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium/Yukon-Kuskokwim Native Health Corporation, Yakima Valley Farm Workers Clinic, Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board/Northwest Tribal Epidemiology Center, Washington Dental Service an Foundation (major private dental insurer); and Medical Assistance Administration (Medicaid agency for Washington State).

"Rochester Collaborative to Reduce Oral Health Dispariti*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The partnership of Eastman Dental Center with the City of Rochester and Rochester City Schools to prevent or reduce disparities in oral health began in 1915 with a gift from George Eastman enabling the creation of the Rochester Dental Dispensary. Today, that partnership extends to the University of Rochester Medical Center, including the School of Medicine and Dentistry. However, despite this rich history of collaboration and an extensive network of community-based oral health facilities, fewer than 30% of children from the most impoverished neighborhoods in the city receive regular oral health care. Further, little is known about disparities in oral diseases or dentofacial disorders among Rochester-dwelling Hispanic families from Puerto Rico and Central America. On the basis of regularly scheduled oral health surveys of Rochester school children, a comprehensive database on the distribution of dental caries has been compiled. However, little data on caries prevalence or incidence by race or ethnic group are available. Similarly, while we know that fewer than 30% of Medicaid eligible Rochester children utilize oral health care services, there are no data on barriers to utilization of the abundant and conveniently located neighborhood and school-based oral health care facilities, nor have effective interventions been developed to improve utilization. Little attention has been given to cultural and behavioral characteristics of minorities that may profoundly influence utilization. Given the rich infrastructure and abundant resources available to us, we have formed a community partnership and a multidisciplinary research collaborative to undertake research on preventing or reducing oral health disparities. In this proposal, we describe three specific aims to: 1) organize research teams; 2) link research and community partners; and 3) refine research questions and design studies that will address the following four lines of research: 1) Assess the distribution of oral disease/disorders, with emphasis on dental caries; investigate factors associated with any excess morbidity observed in Rochester-dwelling Hispanic children and contrast findings with matched cohorts of African-American and Caucasian children; 2) Determine the impact of existing oral health care programs on disparities in oral disease morbidity; 3) Identify barriers to effective utilization of the oral health care system; and, 4) Develop intervention strategies that will prevent or reduce disparities in both the levels of oral diseases as well as in access to, and effective utilization of, the oral health care system.         ",Rochester Collaborative to Reduce Oral Health Dispariti*,6655023,R21DE015004,"['dental caries ', ' oral health ', ' dental research ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' health care service utilization ', ' health care service availability ', ' human morbidity ', ' health behavior ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' socioeconomics ', ' community ', ' culture ', ' children ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R21,2003,157500,0.35417541509734507
"Examining Disparities in Child Dental Medicaid  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The candidate is currently a fellow in Pediatric Dentistry completing a Ph.D in Health Policy Analysis with additional advanced training in health services research. She has a long established history of commitment and interest in research and academic dentistry.  This application proposes a comprehensive interdisciplinary program wherein the candidate would receive the necessary training and mentorship to develop into an independent investigator. Two phases are described. In the first phase (Scholarly Development) Dr. Lee will work under the mentorship of Dr. R. Gary Rozier and a research advisory committee to complete the first part of the study. In the second phase (Faculty Transition) the candidate will work more independently to complete the second part of the proposal and build upon this research to seek additional funding. This will assist in the transition towards becoming an independent investigator. The research component will examine disparities in access to oral health care for pre-school aged children enrolled in Medicaid.   The current level of oral health service utilization in Medicaid has presented a major public policy challenge as evident by reports from the Office of Technology Assessment, the General Accounting Office and the Office of the Surgeon General. Medicaid is the country's largest investment in improving access and decreasing oral health problems of young low-income children. It has been established that low-income, minority, rural children have a disproportionately higher level of dental disease, but very little is known about their use of and access to oral health services. This research proposal will be the first to systematically study racial and geographic disparities and their interactions with each other and Medicaid enrollment on utilization, treatment outcomes and expenditures among pre-school aged children.   Four large databases will be used: Composite birth records from 1992, Medicaid enrollment and claims files from 1992-97, and the Area Resource File. This longitudinal cohort study treats the child as the unit of analysis. The data set will contain multiple observations per child-that is one observation for each year until the fifth birthday. Panel data techniques, specifically random effects models, will be incorporated into the estimation equations. Complex and hierarchical modeling will be used in the analyses. While controlling for predisposing and enabling characteristics, we will examine disparities on different outcome measures; 1) any oral health utilization 2) extent of utilization 3) type of visit 4) avoidable hospitalizations and source of care 5) dental related Medicaid expenditures. We will also examine quality performance measures as established by the NCQA expert panel.

"Molecular Epidemiology of Dental Caries Susceptibility  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Dental caries is one of the most common diseases of childhood. It occurs in children of all socioeconomic classes and in every country around the world. In the United States, there is disparity in caries prevalence such that 80% of the caries occur in 20% of the children, primarily minority children or those from low income families. Although there is clear evidence that dental caries is a multifactorial infectious disease with many environmental contributory factors, there is also strong evidence for a host genetic component in the etiology of this disease. Currently, the most reliable predictor of a child's future risk for caries is the presence of one or more carious teeth. Other environmental factors contribute to this risk but do not provide the level of specificity needed for the targeting of effective preventive measures. The objective of this application is to screen candidate genes to identify sequence polymorphisms that occur more frequently in subjects with dental caries than in those without caries. A secondary objective is to initiate the collection of families with multiple affected children to be used for a genome scan in a future application. The central hypothesis of the application is that sequence variations in one or more candidate genes, combined with environmental factors, can be used to predict caries risk prior to the occurrence of disease. Two hundred affected children aged 3 to 4 years and age and race matched controls will be ascertained from Iowa for linkage disequilibrium studies. Families with multiple affected siblings will be ascertained whenever possible. Candidate genes will include genes involved in enamel mineralization and in salivary buffering. Collection of families will be done to facilitate future genome wide scans for caries susceptibility loci. Identification of genetic markers for dental caries will provide us with a better understanding of the caries process on an individual basis, a more reliable method to assess caries risk and will facilitate the development of targeted preventive strategies.

"Linking Mother and Child Access to Dental Care DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator):  Background. Healthy People 2010 and the U.S. Surgeon General's report, Oral Health in America, indicate that caries is a severe oral health problem among low-income, minority preschool children that is compounded by low access to dental care.  Potential solutions to this problem may exist in the linkage between mother and child access to dental care.  If low-income mothers have a regular source of dental care (RSDC), oral health benefits may accrue to both mother and child through biological and dental care mechanisms, but little is known about these associations.      Aims.  Among children aged three-to-six years old and enrolled in Medicaid dental insurance in Washington state (N=115,853), study aims are: 1) to measure the percentage of mothers with a RSDC and identify the determinants of mothers having a RSDC; 2) among mothers, to determine whether having a RSDC is associated with greater dental knowledge, oral health behaviors, dental satisfaction, better self-reported oral health, and less reparative treatment and work loss due to dental care; 3) among children, to determine whether having a mother with a RSDC is associated with greater utilization of dental care and better oral health; and 4) among children, to determine whether children with mothers losing dental coverage have less dental utilization than other children.      Methods.  Aims will be achieved through a prospective cohort study design composed of a baseline survey of mothers and one-year follow-up of children's dental utilization from Medicaid dental claims.  Disproportionate stratified random sampling will select Medicaid households with children aged three-to-six years in four racial/ethnic strata (White non-Hispanic (n=3,050), Hispanic (n=4,511), African-American (n=6,100), and other race/ethnic groups (n=4,518).  At least 780 sampled mothers will complete a baseline telephone or mail survey.  One year later, Medicaid dental claims for one-year pre/post-survey will be extracted for sampled children.  Separate regression analyses will be conducted for each racial/ethnic stratum.  Aim 1 analyses will identify factors associated with mothers having a RSDC.  Aim 2 analyses of mothers will determine the association between having a RSDC and knowledge and attitudes about dental care, oral health behaviors, and dental utilization.  Aim 3 analyses of children will determine whether having a mother with a RSDC is associated with greater dental utilization in the prospective year.  Aim 4 analyses of children will determine whether mothers' loss of dental insurance results in fewer children dental utilization.

"A LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF LEAD EXPOSURE AND DENTAL CARIES The long-term goal of our research is to elucidate underlying mechanisms by which the physical and social environments result in health disparities.  Our previous work has shown that the hypothesis that lead exposure is a risk factor for dental caries is plausible and could have significant public health impact, especially for individuals in impoverished circumstances (Watson et al., 1997; Moss et al., 1999). We will study dental caries risk due to environmental lead exposure in a birth cohort of 245 Cincinnati children that have been participants in the Cincinnati Lead Cohort Study since late 1979.  The on-going study of 15-16 year-olds is currently in its third year of funding (R01 ES08158, Early Exposure to Lead and Adolescent Development, P.I.: K. Dietrich).  This group of African-American and white Appalachian children is arguably the most well-described longitudinal cohort ever studied for prenatal and postnatal lead exposure (prenatal maternal blood lead concentration, neonatal blood lead concentration, quarterly assessments of the concentration of lead in blood from birth to 5 years and semi-annually thereafter).  This cohort is unique among the major longitudinal studies of lead and child health in that a substantial number of subjects were exposed to clinically significant levels of lead during early development.  Peak lead exposure in this cohort ranges from 5 to over 80 micrograms/dL. We will collect additional data specifically related to dental caries risk and perform laboratory microanalytic assessments of lead in plaque and enamel.  This will allow us to test a series of hypotheses that relate environmental lead exposure to risk for dental caries development in adolescents. The work of this project will focus on four specific aims related to 1) Demonstrating the strength of the association between environmental lead exposure and risk for dental caries and ruling out alternative explanations; 2) Assessing the utility of permanent tooth enamel, deciduous tooth enamel, deciduous tooth dentin and supragingival plaque as biomarkers for lead exposure using microanalytic techniques; 3) Testing mechanistic hypotheses that show lead exposure a) reduces salivary gland function; b) acts as an effect modifer to reduce the protective effect of salivary fluoride; c) is most strongly linked to caries when measured during enamel formation; 4) Exploring more broadly the basis for oral disease disparities in disadvantaged groups by examining the interplay of lead, nutrition, and social factors.

"The impact of dental education on health disparities Background: Attempts to reduce the startling oral health disparities in the US will only be effective and listing if oral health care providers are deeply committed and adequately prepared to actively participate in this process through effective clinical care as well as community leadership. As members of a profession in the classic sense of that term, dentists and hygienists carry a responsibility toward the public at large to insure effective oral health care for all patients in need of such care. This is, however, an ever more daunting challenge. The universities that educate future oral health care professionals are therefore obligated to adequately prepare their students for this challenge. Hypothesis: Professional dental and hygiene education inadequately prepares dentists and hygienists to realize their professional commitment towards vulnerable, marginalized, and other underserved patients through effective oral health care and community leadership. Objective: To develop, plan and formulate and interdisciplinary concerned research project aimed at the identification of curricular deficiencies, the design and subsequent assessment of innovative educational interventions, and the determination of implementation strategies. Approach: The planning grant should enable the following seven undertakings: 1. A comprehensive and detailed search and analysis of the literature. 2. A comprehensive inventory and analysis of exemplary educational activities that have been undertaken (un)successfully at dental schools and hygiene programs in the US, as well as abroad. 3. A diagnosis of educational voids that appear to contribute to oral health disparities. 4. The initial development of a conceptual and theoretical framework, incl.  ethical questions of access and social justice in oral health care, and three pedagogy of service-learning. 5. The determination of a comprehensive educational, based on the results of the preceding steps. 6.The formulation of research questions derived from the desired educational changes. 7. The design of a research implementation process and development of one or more R01 grant(s). Limitation: In principle, graduating dentists and hygienists should be competent to address the needs of any underserved patient category. However, different categories may require different provider competencies and hence different curricular innovations. In this planning grant, three different patient categories will be examined: 1. Patients with advanced Alzheimer's Disease; 2. Patients of African-American descent; and 3. Recent immigrants.

"Predicting Caries Risk in Underserved Toddlers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): According to the first-ever Surgeon General's report on oral health in North America (2000), dental caries is the most common chronic childhood disease. In addition, most (75-80%) of the severe caries problems in children in this country occur in a small segment of the population (20-25%), and this problem is particularly prevalent in minorities and immigrants. These affected children are also often found in the lower socioeconomic strata and commonly develop caries at a very early age. Therefore, it is imperative that early in life a child is assessed to identify and eventually treat those children who are at greatest risk for the development of Early Childhood Caries (ECC), preferably before disease development. The purpose of this exploratory study is to develop an innovative self-administered structured caries risk questionnaire to identify toddlers (18-36 months of age) at the highest risk of developing ECC, focusing on at-risk population groups (e.g., African American and Hispanic). The focus will be to identify the caries risk behaviors that the primary caregiver and child have, the impact that their knowledge on oral health has on these factors, and the influence that perceptions of their dental health have on seeking dental care. A range of social, cultural, functional, psychological, socio-demographic, dietary and biological factors that may affect transmission, development of caries, general health, and access to care in these populations will be included. The questionnaire will be developed in three phases. Phase 1 will involve refinement of an initial draft by dental peers and a focus group of target primary caregivers. In Phase 2, this revised version will be then used in a large test population (400 primary caregivers/child pairs). A strength of this proposal is that it will use as the outcome variable for predictive modeling (Phase 3), the detection and 12-month monitoring of early, precavitated caries lesions, using two of the most innovative and sensitive methods for caries detection and monitoring, the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) and the Quantitative Light induced Fluorescence system (QLF), which will allow for a more accurate assessment of disease development and progression over time than traditional level of cavity detection.            ",Predicting Caries Risk in Underserved Toddlers,6887171,R21DE016451,"['pediatrics ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' dental caries ', ' dental disorder diagnosis ', ' oral health ', ' preventive dentistry ', ' early diagnosis ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' self care ', ' caregiver ', ' patient care management ', ' health care service utilization ', ' human subject ', ' dental survey ', ' health behavior ', ' ethnic group ', ' socioeconomics ', ' method development ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' focus group ', ' ']",NIDCR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R21,2004,227250,0.2026673746900468
"Longitudinal study of caries in a rural WIC population    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the prevalence of dental caries has declined for the majority of U.S. children in recent decades, there are profound disparities in dental caries experience where young children from low-income or minority families suffer a disproportionate share of the disease burden. To effectively address the problem of caries in the primary dentition of high-risk children, preventive efforts should be directed at these children beginning at a very early age. The WIC supplemental nutritional program is one of the very few programs that serves children at very young ages, and it also serves children from low-income families. However, there are limited data available about the oral health of WIC-enrolled populations, and studies have not longitudinally followed subjects in such a population. Thus, the goals for the proposed study are to longitudinally track caries experience in WIC-enrolled children; to assess methods to enhance subject recruitment and retention in these populations and to gather longitudinal caries risk data on WIC populations. We will also explore how S. mutans clonal types change over time, as well as how they interact with host genetic markers and predict caries development in these high-risk young children.  Specifically, the study will follow a cohort of WIC-enrolled 1-year-old children for 18 months in Muscatine and Louisa counties in Iowa - two rural counties with large Hispanic populations. Collection of pilot data in this population will allow our research team and others to continue research aimed at reducing oral health disparities, including longitudinal trials of preventive interventions. Moreover, interventions centered at WIC programs have the potential to become sustainable caries-prevention programs for high-risk children throughout the country. We will collect data on caries occurrence, beverage consumption, fluoride exposures, S. mutans levels and clonal type, and host genetic markers, and we will assess different methods of recruiting and retaining subjects in this high-risk population. Data from this pilot study will be of great value and will position the study team to effectively conduct future intervention studies to reduce oral health disparities.         ",Longitudinal study of caries in a rural WIC population,6850467,R21DE015008,"['Streptococcus mutans ', ' infant human (0-1 year) ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' dental caries ', ' dental plaque ', ' oral health ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' beverage ', ' genetic marker ', ' fluorine ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' human subject ', ' data collection ', ' oral bacteria ', ' saliva ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' rural area ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' clinical research ', ' bacteria infection mechanism ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2004,14514,0.22160207623145556
"Oral Health and Quality of Life in Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health stressed the significance of understanding how to bring oral health care to those segments of the US population that need it most, but are underserved. Children from socio economically disadvantaged backgrounds are one of these groups. Gaining a clearer understanding of how to improve their situation is the overall objective of this proposal. The concrete aims are (a) to validate the self report version and the parent/guardian (proxy) version of the Michigan Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (MOHRQOL) Scale for children (Aim 1), (b) to design and validate a short screening version of this instrument that parents/guardians and teachers can use to identify children in need for oral health care (Aim 2), (c) to identify the factors that ultimately determine parents'/guardians' decisions to seek oral health care for a child (Aim 3), and (d) to develop and evaluate educational material for parents/guardians and teachers/school administrators to alert them to the importance of regular preventive oral health care for elementary school age children as well as how to obtain reparative care once a child in need is identified (Aim 4). In order to investigate these aims, a research project is proposed that collects data from elementary school children, their parents/guardians, and teachers. In Study 1, survey data will be collected (a) from elementary school age children from underprivileged backgrounds about their ohrqol (N=3,000), and (b) from their parents/guardians (N=400) about their child's oral health, oral health care needs, and oral health-related quality of life. The children's oral health will be determined in oral exams. This study is used to validate the MOHRQOL - child and parent (proxy) versions (Aim 1), and to do a test-item analysis to identify the items that can be used in a screening instrument for parents and teachers. In Study 2, teachers (N=300) will be surveyed to assess their awareness of how oral health problems might interfere with learning, and whether they can identify when this is the case. In Year 2, the screening versions of the MOHRQOL for parents / guardians and teachers will be validated (Aim 2) by conducting Study 3. This study collects oral health data from children (N=3,000), as well as data collected with the screening instrument from children, parents/guardians (N=400), and teachers (N=300). Study 4 is designed as a focus group study with parents/guardians and teachers. Its goal is to identify the factors that shape parents'/guardians' decisions to seek oral health care for a child (Aim 3), and determine which informational needs parents and teachers have concerning children's oral health. Based on these findings, educational material for parents/guardians and teachers will be developed and its effectiveness will be evaluated in Study 5, a survey study of parents' (N=400) and teachers' (N=300) evaluations of the educational materials (Aim 4).         ",Oral Health and Quality of Life in Children,6773007,R01DE014887,"['middle childhood (6-11) ', ' dental disorder diagnosis ', ' oral health ', ' preventive dentistry ', ' health education ', ' parent ', ' medical outreach /case finding ', ' health care referral /consultation ', ' health care service utilization ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care cost /financing ', ' human subject ', ' information dissemination ', ' interview ', ' questionnaire ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' health survey ', ' ethnic group ', ' socioeconomics ', ' quality of life ', ' teacher ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' educational resource design /development ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' focus group ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2004,337953,0.27011598084565286
"Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health A Center Addressing Disparities in Children's Oral Health is proposed at the University of California, San Francisco, with two primary institutional partners serving minority populations, the San Francisco Department of Public Health and the San Ysidro Community Health Center, a model health center located near the US-Mexican border, and additional collaborating institutions. The theme for this Center is to understand, prevent, and reduce oral health disparities among young children, with a primary focus on preventing early childhood caries. A secondary theme is to understand the interactions between the oral health and medical delivery systems that can affect children's oral health. These goals will be pursued from two primary directions: retrospective data- based projects to increase our understanding of the etiology of oral health disparities and to identify children most susceptible, and intervention projects to prevent disease. In this center we will 1) Support primarily patient and population-oriented research related to reducing oral health disparities in children; 2) Establish core facilities to provide technical services and resources to Center-affiliated projects; 3) Provide an enriched environment for training future health-care professionals and scientists, especially those from under-represented groups; 4) Establish mechanisms to increase collaboration among investigators in Center- supported projects, across health professions and affiliated collaborating public and private institutions on the west coast. Findings from this project will 1) identify cultural, environmental, workforce, behavioral, and biologic factors associated with health disparities among the ethnic/racial groups in the very diverse California environment; 2) enhance our ability to target children likely to be at risk for dental caries; 3) provide successful interdisciplinary interventions to prevent disease and reduce oral health disparities.

"Conference: Elders' Oral Health Summit    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral Health in American eiders has improved dramatically over the past 5 decades, yet important disparities in oral health status and access to care remain among the frail, chronically ill, the poor, and ""minority"" elders.  We propose a two-day workshop to be held in Boston on September 13 and 14, 2004. This workshop, planned as a follow-up to ""Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon General"" (2000), will critically examine what we know and what we need to know regarding determinants of access to dental care and oral health among elders. We will develop and prioritize recommendations for research related to access to, and financing of oral health care among elders, as a prelude to the development of a plan for improving access to oral health care for underserved elders. Thus the specific aims of this conference are to: 1. Systematically review national (US) data on access to dental care among community dwelling as well as the frail and institutionalized elderly; 2. Examine determinants of access to care and oral health among older Americans; 3. Examine disparities in access and oral health among the poor, and racial and ethnic minorities; 4. Compare the access to dental care in the US with access in other developed nations with aging populations; 5. Systematically review the financing of dental care among the elderly, including the frail, the poor and racial groups in the US and around the world; and 6. Describe what we know and need to know about improving access to oral health care for elders including options for financing elders' dental care in the future. Systematic reviews of the literature will be prepared prior to the two-day workshop to serve as background papers. These papers will be revised based on discussions at the workshop, and submitted with recommendations for further research and a plan of action, as a package for publication in the Journal of Dental Education. Summaries of the workshop and Research agendas will be submitted to Journal of the American Dental Association, Health Affairs and Special Care in Dentistry as well as Consumer publications from the AARP, the Older Women's League and the Gray Panthers.             ",Conference: Elders' Oral Health Summit,6731875,R13DE014703,"['human old age (65+) ', ' oral health ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care cost /financing ', ' meeting /conference /symposium ', ' travel ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R13,2004,52500,0.27975943008846293
"Detroit Oral Cancer Prevention Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Detroit Oral Cancer Prevention Project is designed based on the extensive epidemiological analysis of the incidence, mortality, and early detection rates in Michigan (MI) during the last decade. African-American (AA) males in Detroit/Wayne County have the highest incidence and mortality rates in MI. The oral cancer survival rates of AA in Detroit have not changed significantly during the last 30 years; and smoking and alcohol use are relatively higher than the national average. Our analysis of data obtained from healthcare providers in community health centers show that 44% of the providers had high knowledge level on oral cancer and they identified high need for CE programs. About 70% of providers reported that they screen for oral cancer; yet there has not been a wide adoption of the one sheet screening form that was prepared specifically for these clinics by our program. A literature review identified that screening for cancers can be increased if a comprehensive media campaign and community outreach programs are implemented (Push-Pull Strategy). The aim of the Detroit Oral Cancer Prevention project is to achieve Healthy People 2010 Objectives. In Detroit (test site), a two-year media campaign will include radio and newspaper advertisements and outdoor signs that will promote early screening, tobacco cessation and reduction in drinking of alcohol. The media campaign will be coordinated with a community outreach educational program conducted in collaboration with churches and 144 local neighborhood organizations; an 800-toll free information telephone service will be available 16 hours per day for 5 days to provide information and schedule patients for free screening at a network of clinics to be available for 5 days per week. Additionally reminder postcards will be mailed to healthcare and dental providers in Detroit to emphasize the need for screening, tobacco cessation and, reduction in drinking of alcohol. In the seven comparison counties, with relatively high concentration of AA) only the reminder cards will be mailed. All healthcare and dental providers (test and comparison counties) will be offered CME or CDE courses (online and via scheduled courses) twice a year in each area. The changes in oral cancer incidence, mortality and early detection rates in Detroit and the comparison counties will be evaluated by the data collected by SEER and the Michigan Cancer Registry.

"Dental Plaque Accumulation as a Risk Factor for CHD DESCRIPTION: Infection is an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD), the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the US and worldwide. Oral disease is increasingly implicated in this capacity. This study will employ an acute disease model to determine whether dental plaque accumulation and the resultant gingivitis have systemic consequences with the potential to increase risk for CHD. Moreover, any variation in both the local and systemic responses between individuals will be identified using this model, thus contributing to our understanding of disparity in CHD risk. These responses may be governed by gender or race. The proposed study will be the first to address these issues using such methodology. The central hypothesis is that dental plaque accumulation will have systemic consequences, with the potential for increasing CHD risk.       The experimental gingivitis model will form the central core of this study. It permits a high level of experimental control, as inflammation develops in response to a localized bacterial challenge, and resolves upon withdrawal of the stimulus. The study will be conducted with the participation of a minimum of 100 healthy young adult subjects (equal numbers of male and female, and black and white). It will be divided into three phases: 1) The 21-day Control phase, during which individuals will perform meticulous plaque control; 2) the 21-day Experimental phase, during which individuals will abstain from all oral hygiene measures; and 3) the 21-day Recovery phase, during which oral hygiene measures will be re-instated. Throughout these phases, levels of dental plaque and resultant gingivitis will be assessed. Peripheral blood collection will permit the concomitant assessment of systemic elements purported to be associated with increased CHD risk (levels of inflammatory markers, markers of lipid metabolism, hemostatic factors and endotoxin, and the extent of neutrophil activation). The study design is longitudinal, and such that each subject will serve as their own control through the comparison of clinical and laboratory data collected on specific days throughout the study period. Furthermore, analysis will permit the identification of high- and Iow-responders, that is individuals exhibiting a significantly increased or decreased inflammatory response respectively, to a given local bacterial challenge. The extent to which gender and race influence this will also be addressed.       The results of this study will further understanding of the potential mechanistic role of oral disease in increasing CHD risk.

"Oral health disparities in the first 4 decades of life DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective: The proposed research aims to use a life-course approach to develop a better understanding of the interplay of biological, environmental and behavioral determinants and antecedents of oral conditions from childhood to oral health by elucidating the nature, scale, persistence and potential mutability of oral health disparities in a population-based cohort of adults.      Methods: The Dunedin Study has traced the development of a representative 1972 birth cohort of 1,000 New Zealand men and women at birth and ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21 and 26. New data will be gathered at age 31, enabling analysis of oral health disparities data from childhood to age 31. The research will: (1) document the natural history of oral conditions through to the 4th decade of life; (2) examine the influence of earlier SES (and SES transitions) on adult oral health; (3) using periodontal disease as a model, test hypotheses about gene-environment interactions in the origins of poor adult oral health; and (4) determine the extent to which poor oral health is an important contributor to (a) poor physical health and (b) experience of adverse life outcomes by the 4th decade of life. The planned research will provide unique information on the scale, persistence and potential mutability of disparities in oral health through the first four decades of life, and will assist in identifying those clinical, public health and policy interventions, which are likely to be most appropriate and efficacious in reducing oral health disparities. The Dunedin Study offers a unique opportunity to conduct such an investigation because of the comprehensive data archive, which has already been assembled.      Implications: The persistence of oral health disparities has not been investigated through the entire life course to date, and close examination of the degree to which the Dunedin cohort's early-life disparities in oral health persist into adulthood would be invaluable in determining whether (and to what extent) such inequalities can be reduced by clinical, public health or policy interventions. The outcome of this important work will inform and determine the nature of measures which are taken to reduce oral health disparities.

"ORAL HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE DESCRIPTION: The goal of the proposed research training plan for Noelle Huntington is to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to become an independent researcher in children?s oral health. The fulfillment of this goal will occur in two phases. The focus of phase one is the relationship between psychosocial factors and oral health outcomes in adults, and will be investigated through secondary analysis of data from the VA Dental Longitudinal Study (DLS) and Normative Aging Study (NAS). Two sets of questions will be addressed. The first concerns the relationship between three oral health constructs - clinical status, self-report of status, and oral health-related quality of life. The second set of questions concerns the disparity in oral health outcomes by socioeconomic condition. It is hypothesized that factors secondary to socioeconomic condition (e.g., insurance, access) serve as mediators between SES and oral health. Theory-based models of these relationships will be designed and tested using DLS and NAS data, including models of change in oral health status following changes in socioeconomic or mediating variables. The second phase will serve as an orientation to the area of children?s oral health research through the guided development and testing of a measure of oral health-related quality of life in children. This measure will then be used to facilitate future research in oral health-related quality of life, beyond the period covered by this fellowship.

"Biotech & Materials Research to Reduce Caries Disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a revision of Grant application No. R13DE015798-01 for a scientific workshop with the aim to: (1) Produce a state-of-the-art assessment of the public health approaches and their limitations in preventing early childhood dental caries in disparity populations. Important in this assessment will be differentiating applied problems of engineering and technology versus fundamental science. (2) Assess recent emerging research in the prevention of dental caries including: specific species bacterial adhesion prevention, biofilm ecology manipulation, circumvention of sucrose driven acid production, genetically engineered antibiotic production in situ, and fluoride- and other antimicrobial-release coatings. (3) Promote a dialogue between end-users, oral microbiologists, and materials and bioengineering experts in order to develop novel prevention technologies and implement the transfer of such technologies to industry and practice. (4) Address the question of what can be done to more effectively use the large body of basic and applied caries science already available to speed solutions to the public health community. (5) Develop a research agenda that will help state, federal, and private funding agencies identify critical research needs; not only for novel technological solutions but also on outreach mechanisms to transfer such novel technologies to industry and public health practice. The rationale for the workshop is that science and technology have not produced sufficient practical tools for public health practitioners and the private delivery system to address the plaque of dental caries that exists for children and adults from families with low incomes and for numerous ethnic minority and racial groups. The 2 1/2 day conference is to be held Winter 2005 in Seattle and involve participants from basic and applied academic dental research, bioengineering and biotechnology, government, and industry. The conference will be co-sponsored by the Northwest/Alaska Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities, the University of Washington UWeb Bioengineering Center, and the Salivary Diagnostics Project.         ",Biotech & Materials Research to Reduce Caries Disparity,6837400,R13DE015798,"['dental caries ', ' meeting /conference /symposium ', ' travel ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R13,2004,18000,0.1717805034077866
"Oral Health Problems of BPD and VLBW adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Very little is known from prior literature about the relationship between very low birth weight (VLBW), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and dental caries in the permanent dentition, due to the fact that only recently are increasing numbers surviving to adolescence because of improved neonatal technology. Both dental caries and VLBW disproportionately affect the poor and minority groups. It is known that VLBW children have a high prevalence of enamel defects in the primary dentition, which in turn can lead to increased susceptibility of the dental enamel to dental caries. The primary objective of this study is to assess the relationship between BPD, VLBW and caries in the permanent dentition of 14-year-old adolescents. Secondarily, we propose to explore the possible mechanisms underlying this relationship by looking at enamel defects, oral health behavior, and synergistic effects of these two factors. Approximately 302 children (110 VLBW with BPD, 80 VLBW without BPD, 112 term healthy) will be studied for dental problems in conjunction with an ongoing developmental study (primary study). The proposed study will collect data on outcome (dental caries), mediating (enamel defects, oral health behavior of child, oral hygiene status) and independent (oral health knowledge, parent's dental behavior) variables. The primary study will provide data on other independent variables such as medical, sociodemographic, parent stressors and cognitive variables. Data analysis includes ANOVA, GLIM procedures for the primary aim, and multivariate regression models for testing mediation effects. Our proposed study is expected to provide much needed data on the extent of oral health problems in the permanent dentition of VLBW adolescents, and to support the further development of an R01 application. The clinical implications include early diagnosis and treatment to prevent further susceptibility to tooth loss and other dental diseases. It is also of public health interest since interventions to target attitudes and oral health practices can be implemented in programs for special health needs children, and there by be useful for improving both oral and general health.            ",Oral Health Problems of BPD and VLBW adolescents,6887243,R21DE016469,"['pediatrics ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' dental caries ', ' oral health ', ' dentition ', ' tooth enamel ', ' preventive dentistry ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' dental health education ', ' human subject ', ' questionnaire ', ' health behavior ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' bronchopulmonary dysplasia ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' clinical research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDCR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2004,229500,0.3208082137595999
"UPR: Project RIPCOHD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this proposed UPR: Project Research Infrastructure Pathway Centered on Oral Health Disparities (RIPCOHD) is to address the building of the infrastructure and capacity of the University of Puerto Rico School of Dentistry (UPRSD) for the conduct, collaboration, and promotion of research. Additionally, Project RIPCOHD will contribute to reducing oral health disparities, with a special emphasis on the disease of dental caries. These goals will be achieved through collaboration with the UPR Research Centers in Minority Institutions and New York University College of Dentistry. The goal will be sustainable in terms of the establishment of research resources, the development of a critical mass of researchers, the enhancement of a research culture within both the faculty and administration at UPRSD, and the expansion of grantsmanship/collaborations with other institutions that will lead to the research aimed at reducing oral health disparities. The specific aims are to: 1) assess, plan, and implement research infrastructure and capacity limitations at the UPRSD, 2) develop collaborative research partnerships, 3) plan, develop & initiate preliminary research projects that enhance the capacity of faculty to successfully compete for funded grant activity on oral health disparities, 4) develop and implement faculty research career development activities, 5) prepare and submit a future infrastructure development grant to continue the research capacity development. The Project Director will be responsible for the successful completion of this project. An Internal Advisory Committee of UPRSD personnel will support him in the activities of Project RIPCOHD, and an External Science and Program Advisory Committee of six senior-level researchers will advise, monitor & evaluate the activities of this project.  In Phase I, the limitations of the UPRSD's research and career development environment will be assessed, enhancement plans developed & implemented. In Phase II, UPRSD researchers will be mentored through projects having the potential to support funded research. Research career development activities will be formalized, and a follow-on infrastructure proposal submitted.

"Antifungal Denture Adhesive Film for Oral Candidiasis DESCRIPTION: The overall goal of this project is to investigate the feasibility of a novel technology to produce an ""Antifungal Denture Adhesive Film"" (ADA) System that will minimize or eliminate the current shortcomings of oral mucosal treatment modalities for candidiasis in denture patients. A recent study reported that over 75 percent of complete denture wearers exhibit dense C. albicans colonization in the sites covered by the upper or lower dentures. Approximately 65 million people in the U.S. are burdened with at least one fully edentulous arch and denture adhesive sales alone exceed $250 million annually. Current estimates for this subpopulation afflicted with this fungus number 10 to 25 million (U.S.). This health disparity is related not only to age of the subject, but other factors as well, such as low socioeconomic level and immunocompromised individuals. This study will test the hypothesis that novel denture adhesive films containing antifungal agents will improve treatment outcomes of oral candidiasis in denture patients. Our approach in Aim 1 is to formulate and produce preliminary ADA systems containing clotrimazole and nystatin. Previous studies will be used to direct the formulation and hot-melt extrusion of the preliminary formulations. Specific Aim 2 will utilize analytical, dissolution, bioadhesion and thermal tests to evaluate these preliminary formulations and identify lead ADA systems. Aims 3 and 4 will produce and further investigate lead formulations by stability studies, in addition to testing these systems for in vitro activity against the Candida species in simulated oral cavity conditions. Aim 5 will evaluate and finalize two optimal bioadhesive drug delivery systems for each model antifungal drug. Successful completion of the project objectives will provide proof-of-concept for an appropriately designed, stable, Antifungal Denture Adhesive Film System that may be advanced to animal or human studies. An ADA system may be used for primary, prophylaxis or adjunct treatment of oral or pharyngeal candidiasis via controlled-release of the antifungal agent from the polymer matrix. In addition, the bioadhesive matrix serves as a denture adhesive for the subject for use in the interim while the fungal infection is being treated on the denture as well. This ADA system will reduce or eliminate the current shortcomings of systemic and currently available topical therapy for oral and pharyngeal candidiasis in a significant patient population.

"An innovative psychoeducational method & ECC prevention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are profound disparities in Early Childhood Caries (ECC) experiences such that children from minority and low-income families suffer a disproportionate share of the disease burden. Many authors recommend educational interventions as one mean of preventing ECC. However, such previous interventions have been only moderately effective and the dental literature still lacks more comprehensive preventive approaches using psychological and behavioral strategies. Thus, the goal of this proposed study is to explore an innovative psychoeducational intervention as a preventive approach for ECC in low-income toddlers enrolled in the WIC supplemental nutritional program. Self-Determination Theory will provide the theoretical support for the psychoeducational intervention to facilitate motivation through people's three innate psychological needs: autonomy, competence and relatedness. Specifically, the study will test a psychoeducational intervention for the prevention of ECC, as well as gather a variety of caries risk pilot data from low-income toddlers enrolled at WIC. Collection of pilot data in this population will allow our research team and others to (1) to examine whether mothers exposed to an autonomy-supportive message will demonstrate changes in self-reported knowledge, behavioral intent and subsequent behavior concerning their child's oral health, and (2) to determine the extent to which their child will present with positive oral health outcomes, such as low levels of Streptococcus mutans, incisor plaque and dental caries. We will collect data on caries occurrence, children's dietary and oral hygiene habits, fluoride exposures, saliva transmission from mother to child, and mothers' self-reported knowledge, behavioral intent, and subsequent behavior concerning their child's oral health. With data from this pilot study, investigators will be able to assess the impact of this innovative intervention on mothers of high-ECC risk children. If successful, widespread use of this psychoeducational intervention could have a profound impact in efforts to reduce oral health disparities.         ",An innovative psychoeducational method & ECC prevention,6887471,R21DE016483,"['preschool child (1-5) ', ' dental caries ', ' dental plaque ', ' dental disorder diagnosis ', ' oral health ', ' preventive dentistry ', ' tooth brushing ', ' dental health education ', ' mother child interaction ', ' fluorine ', ' human subject ', ' videotape /videodisc ', ' questionnaire ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' diet ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' health behavior ', ' behavioral habituation /sensitization ', ' motivation ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' human therapy evaluation ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' behavior therapy ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2004,147500,0.27853511321788244
"Longitudinal study of caries in a rural WIC population    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the prevalence of dental caries has declined for the majority of U.S. children in recent decades, there are profound disparities in dental caries experience where young children from low-income or minority families suffer a disproportionate share of the disease burden. To effectively address the problem of caries in the primary dentition of high-risk children, preventive efforts should be directed at these children beginning at a very early age. The WIC supplemental nutritional program is one of the very few programs that serves children at very young ages, and it also serves children from low-income families. However, there are limited data available about the oral health of WIC-enrolled populations, and studies have not longitudinally followed subjects in such a population. Thus, the goals for the proposed study are to longitudinally track caries experience in WIC-enrolled children; to assess methods to enhance subject recruitment and retention in these populations and to gather longitudinal caries risk data on WIC populations. We will also explore how S. mutans clonal types change over time, as well as how they interact with host genetic markers and predict caries development in these high-risk young children.  Specifically, the study will follow a cohort of WIC-enrolled 1-year-old children for 18 months in Muscatine and Louisa counties in Iowa - two rural counties with large Hispanic populations. Collection of pilot data in this population will allow our research team and others to continue research aimed at reducing oral health disparities, including longitudinal trials of preventive interventions. Moreover, interventions centered at WIC programs have the potential to become sustainable caries-prevention programs for high-risk children throughout the country. We will collect data on caries occurrence, beverage consumption, fluoride exposures, S. mutans levels and clonal type, and host genetic markers, and we will assess different methods of recruiting and retaining subjects in this high-risk population. Data from this pilot study will be of great value and will position the study team to effectively conduct future intervention studies to reduce oral health disparities.         ",Longitudinal study of caries in a rural WIC population,6790064,R21DE015008,"['Streptococcus mutans ', ' infant human (0-1 year) ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' dental caries ', ' dental plaque ', ' oral health ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' beverage ', ' genetic marker ', ' fluorine ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' human subject ', ' data collection ', ' oral bacteria ', ' saliva ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' rural area ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' clinical research ', ' bacteria infection mechanism ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2004,203727,0.22160207623145556
"Symptom Interpretation & Oral Health among Harlem Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the oral health of the US population has greatly improved over the last three decades, significant disparities continue to exist among different subpopulations. The Surgeon General's report ""Oral Health in America"" published in 2000 revealed a hidden epidemic of oral diseases that is largely borne by these disadvantaged social groups. In the Harlem Household Survey, from among 50 health complaints about which respondents were questioned, problems with teeth or gums were the most frequently cited problem (30 percent). What remedial actions, if any, do disadvantaged individuals take when they experience oral symptoms or problems? While access to care is undoubtedly a critical determinant of the actions they will take, other factors much less well investigated or understood such as lay beliefs, attitudes and emotions (e.g., fear and threat) are also important. For example, the casual attributions they assign to their oral symptom/problems, will guide their coping responses including whether to seek formal dental care, attempt self care (including self-medication and treatment), or do nothing for now (i.e., delay action).   To gain better understanding of these issues, we propose to study the symptom appraisal processes and coping responses of non-Hispanic Black/African Americans residing in Central Harlem who have experienced an oral symptom within the last six months. Of particular interest, are the self-care behaviors used in response to oral problems. In the field of dental research, self-care has been looked at almost exclusively in terms of behaviors enacted by the individuals to prevent dental problems (i.e. oral health behaviors). Particularly brushing, flossing, use of interdental devices, use of mouthwashes, and regular dental visits. There is on the other hand, a dearth of research data self-care behavior in response to dental or oral symptom and problems (i.e., illness behavior), which is our focus in the proposed study.  In depth face-to-face, focused interviews will be conducted with 120 adults. As in several of the principal Investigator's previous federally funded investigations, qualitative research methods will be employed.

"Observed Factors Affecting Prevention in Dental Practice    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identification of mutable factors associated with the delivery of preventive services by dentists in general practice is the subject of this study. Identification of such factors will lead to the design, implementation, and evaluation of interventions that will improve preventive services provided in general dental practice. The conceptual framework for factor identification is that provided by Andersen in the Behavioral Model of Health Services Use. This study of dental practice will be focused on 120 Ohio dental practices that are part of the first dental practice research network to be organized in the United States. The methodology includes a direct observation technique developed at UC Davis and utilized at CWRU for the study of Family Medical Practice. Data concerning dental practice will be gathered by two teams of dental hygienists observing dentists and hygienists in each office for 3 days. Approximately 6000 patient visits will be observed. The direct observation will utilize the Davis Observation Code, a well-tested instrument to record physician behavior, adapted to dental practice. Data also will be collected utilizing information from patient questionnaires, practitioner surveys, billing data, and qualitative reporting. Comparison of information gathered by different methods will indicate the least expensive accurate methods for collecting various kinds of information about dental practice. Hypotheses will be tested concerning the association of preventive service delivery with risk for oral disease, delivery of esthetic services, dentists' beliefs about the importance of tobacco counseling, the socioeconomic status of patients, and the ethnicity of the dentist. This first large scale study utilizing a dental practice research network will provide statistically significant data concerning factors that influence provision of preventive services (counseling and procedures) to patients in actual practice settings.         ",Observed Factors Affecting Prevention in Dental Practice,6731637,R01DE015171,"['dental health service ', ' dental personnel ', ' preventive dentistry ', ' health care quality ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' human subject ', ' dental survey ', ' African American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDCR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,763935,0.1281730752001005
"Molecular Analysis of the Biofilm in Caries and Health DESCRIPTION: Dental caries is the most common chronic disease of childhood, and is the biggest unmet health care need among America's children. Socioeconomic disparities in both rates of disease and treatment are a major public health issue. To date, effective biological interventions to prevent caries have not been developed. Dental plaque contains several hundred different organisms, many of which are poorly studied. A number of species have been shown to produce sufficient acid to drive pH below critical levels and to tolerate low pH. Research has primarily focused on Streptococcus mutans as the etiologic agent in caries, but based the work of previous investigators using cultivation and on our preliminary findings using molecular methods, S. mutans is not always present in caries, is often found at low levels, and additional and unexpected bacterial species may be important. In addition, comparatively little attention has been paid to identifying health-associated and potentially beneficial bacterial species that may reside in the oral cavity. For the proposed project, bacterial species present in childhood caries and health will be identified by cloning and sequencing bacterial 16S ribosomal genes amplified from DNA isolated from plaque samples. This open ended approach will allow the detection and identification of all bacterial species present, including novel, uncultivated or unexpected species. The presence and quantities of the species identified by this approach as potentially associated with caries or health will then be determined using quantitative, real-time PCR. This dual-technique approach will allow the examination of a much larger sample size than is possible by cloning and sequencing alone. Accomplishment of the proposed studies will identify the pathogens associated with the onset and progression of severe caries of the primary and young permanent dentition, and identify those bacterial species associated with a healthy dentition. This study will also provide a comprehensive catalog of the supragingival flora in children based on molecular technology. The significance of the proposed work is that identification of additional caries pathogens would provide alternative targets for biological interventions, and identification of beneficial health-associated species could provide the basis for therapeutic interventions to establish caries-resistant microbial communities.

"Oral Health Outcomes of Early Childhood Malnutrition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objectives of this retrospective cohort study are to assess the impact of early protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) on the permanent dentition, specifically with respect to: 1) dental caries, 2) enamel hypoplasia, 3) tooth eruption timing, and 4) salivary function. The proposed investigation will seek to assess clear dose-response and temporal relationships between early childhood PEM (ages birth-5 years old) and these oral outcomes at ages 10-18 years. An explanatory model of enamel hypoplasia, salivary gland hypofunction, tooth eruption timing, and socioeconomic risk factors as possible mechanisms for caries following PEM exposure will be examined. The few existing published human studies of PEM and oral outcomes were typically of cross-sectional design, with limited control for confounding variables, and almost exclusively focused on the primary dentition. Until now, there has been no high quality data base of past PEM exposure with a sufficient lag period of 10 years or more to allow the study of early childhood malnutrition effects on the permanent dentition. This study will capitalize on a 'natural experiment situation' that has occurred in Haiti, i.e. a database of serial weightings of children in their first 5 years of life, who had experienced the full range of PEM, and will maximize the time since exposure for disease determination. PEM exposure will be assessed using weights included in an ongoing Haitian Health Foundation database maintained since 1988 on over 16,000 children. The completion of this natural experiment only requires the collection of the oral health data from a randomly selected sub-group of these 16,000 children, stratified by nutrition status according to the severity and chronicity of their exposure to PEM. A random sample of 10-18 year old children frequency matched for age and gender will be recruited from each PEM stratum, for a total sample of 1,250 children. The investigation will consist of a four-month-long field dental examination, saliva collection and interview survey by a calibrated team of U.S. and Haitian trained dentists and epidemiologists. The primary analyses will consist of regression models that will assess the associations between the four oral outcomes and PEM levels and socioeconomic factors, as well as determining age-specific critical PEM exposure(s). The findings of this study will provide the first scientific evidence regarding the potential effect of early childhood PEM on the complete permanent dentition based on a retrospective longitudinal cohort study. Given the universality of PEM pathophysiology, this study's findings will be generalizable to subsets of U.S. children having 9 oral health disparities.         ",Oral Health Outcomes of Early Childhood Malnutrition,6817960,R01DE014708,"['bioenergetics ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' middle childhood (6-11) ', ' dental caries ', ' oral health ', ' dentition ', ' tooth enamel ', ' dentistry ', ' pathologic process ', ' human subject ', ' questionnaire ', ' malnutrition ', ' protein deficiency ', ' salivary gland ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' early experience ', ' socioeconomics ', ' clinical research ', ' outcomes research ', ' ']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,577782,0.27129748342356486
"Periodontal Disease in Diabetic Women with Preterm Birth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This pilot proposal is in response to an RFA to Prevent or Reduce Oral Health Disparities and seeks to establish a collaborative study partnering the periodontal and molecular epidemiology expertise at the University of North Carolina School of Dentistry with the Obstetrics/Gynecology expertise at the University of Hawaii School of Medicine to examine the role of periodontal disease in pre-term deliveries among pregnant diabetic Asian & Pacific Islander (API) women.  This is an understudied minority population with a high prevalence of both diabetes and pre-term delivery. Periodontal disease is an oral infection that is more severe among diabetics and also increases insulin resistance among diabetics.  Periodontitis also is associated with increased risk for pre-term delivery, pre-term premature rupture of membranes and growth restriction. Diabetes among pregnant women is a risk factor for both pre-term delivery and macrosomia. Thus, we seek to examine whether periodontal infection among diabetic women may provide some contribution to the observed high rate of pre-term delivery among API diabetics. Specifically, this proposal seeks to conduct a pilot case-control study to determine the extent of periodontal disease in API diabetic (Type 1, Type 2 or gestational) and non-diabetic women who have term and pre-term deliveries (<37 weeks gestational age). Approximately 92 diabetic and 92 non-diabetic pre-term delivery API mothers and 184 diabetic and 184 non-diabetic term delivery API mothers will be studied (frequency matched on race 1 case: 2 controls). Full-mouth periodontal examinations will be performed using standardized methods and calibrated examiners. Preliminary data will be generated by analyzing fetal cord blood for markers of fetal exposure to oral pathogens of maternal origin, as indexed by bacterial-specific fetal IgM levels and fetal stress as reflected by slCAM and CRP levels. In addition a subset of fetal membranes will be analyzed for protein expression of IL-lb, TNFa and IL-6 by ELISAs and MMP-8 mRNA by Northerns. Pilot data will be generated to support an R01 application that will originate from the U of H (a minority institution) with Dr. Millar as PI, to test the hypothesis that periodontitis is more extensive among API diabetic women and associated with higher rate of fetal exposure to oral pathogens than among non-diabetics and that the prevalence of periodontal disease and frequency of fetal exposure is higher among pre-term deliveries for both diabetics and non-diabetics, as compared to term deliveries. In this collaboration UNC will also provide the U of H study personnel the periodontal and molecular epidemiology research training and experience needed in multi-disciplinary studies of periodontal disease and obstetrics to conduct the planned R01 application.         ",Periodontal Disease in Diabetic Women with Preterm Birth,6798806,R21DE014984,"['premature infant human ', ' cooperative study ', ' periodontium disorder ', ' gestational diabetes mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ', ' noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' immunoglobulin M ', ' human pregnant subject ', ' interleukin 1 ', ' interleukin 6 ', ' tumor necrosis factor alpha ', ' enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ', ' messenger RNA ', ' epidemiology ', ' premature labor ', ' gestational age ', ' postpartum ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' embryo /fetus membrane ', ' bacterial protein ', ' female ', ' Asian ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' northern blotting ', ' clinical research ', ' cord blood ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2004,162940,0.09345325295830624
"Enhancing Oral Health Care Use by HIV-Positives DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent national studies demonstrate that oral health care is one of the highest unmet health care needs for HIV-positive (HIV+) individuals, although it is recognized as playing a critical role in the medical management of HIV/AIDS. Social and economic factors have contributed to less than optimal use of oral health services for HIV+s in the United States. According to recent data, from Miami-Dade County, Florida, only 24% of HIV+s served by Ryan White-funded medical clinics had obtained oral health services in the past 12 months.  To address the underutilization of oral health care services, we propose to develop, implement, and evaluate an intervention to assist low-income HIV+s in obtaining access to oral health services as well as increase appropriate utilization of these services. The intervention is a brief, client-centered case management intervention. The case management intervention is adapted from an intervention that has been previously tested in a CDC-funded, multi-site study designed to link recently diagnosed HIV+s to primary medical care.  A two-arm randomized trial among HIV+ individuals who are currently enrolled in HIV primary medical care, but not receiving oral health care, will be conducted to test the intervention. The two arms will consist of a case management intervention and standard-of-care. Participants will be assessed at baseline, and at 9 and 18 months after baseline, to document their utilization of oral health services. An interdisciplinary team of behavioral and clinical research scientists with experience in developing and evaluating health care and prevention interventions targeting low income, HIV+s will conduct this research.

"Reducing Oral Cancer Disparities in Florida DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Florida bears a disproportionate burden from cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx: in 2000, Florida had the nation's second highest age-adjusted incidence rate for females and fifth-highest rate for males, and had the second highest number of new cases. Black/African American and white males in Florida experience comparable incidence rates, but blacks experience significantly higher mortality rates and lower survival rates, suggesting that earlier detection may help reduce racial disparities in prognosis. This project seeks to promote oral cancer awareness and early detection among blacks/African Americans in Florida through the following Specific Aims: (1) Use a social marketing approach to develop a mass-media campaign on oral and pharyngeal cancer for a population at high risk for incidence and mortality; (2) Increase the proportion of the target population that knows the major risk factors, signs, and symptoms of oral and pharyngeal cancer; and (3) Increase the proportion of the target population that receives a clinical examination for oral and pharyngeal cancer. Using a theory-based social marketing approach guided by preliminary study findings, this project will develop culturally-appropriate, research-based educational messages and materials. The project will use two approaches to increase oral cancer awareness, knowledge, and preventive behaviors among black/African American adults in northeast Florida: 1) a wide-scale mass media approach centered in Duval County but reaching all surrounding counties; and 2) a targeted, faith-based effort among a network of primarily African American churches in medically and dentally underserved areas in northeast Florida. A toll free telephone hotline will be available to provide additional information and links to clinical facilities for exams. County health departments in northeast Florida will provide oral cancer examinations at their facilities, and onsite examinations will be provided by dentists at participating churches. Effectiveness of the interventions will be measured through population-based surveys and utilization of the hotline and clinics.

"Detroit Center for Research on Oral Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant) - The Detroit Center for Research on Oral Health Disparities aims to promote oral health and reduce disparities within the community of low-income African American children (0-5 years) and their main caregivers (14 + years) living in the City of Detroit. The driving theme of the center's research program is to identify determinants and design interventions to answer the following question: why do some low-income African American children and their main caregivers have better oral health than others who live in the same community? The proposed center will focus on studying intra-group disparities in oral health. The community based partners, the City of Detroit Department of Health (DDH) and the Voices of Detroit Initiative (VODI) have strongly supported this theme. The Center will include 3 support cores, 5 research core projects and 1 pilot study. The Center's Methodology Core will select a multistage random sample of African American families living in the poorest 39 Census Tracts in the City of Detroit. A total of 1,529 families will be sampled and interviewed in their homes. It is estimated that 994 families will be examined at community centers in year 2 (2002) funding. Based on extensive data collected by the investigative team (R01 MH58299) in Detroit, the investigators predict that 760 families will be retained by the third examination phase in year 6 (2006). The research teams will investigate the social characteristics of parents, families, and neighborhoods, that are associated with disparities in oral health (dental caries and periodontal diseases) of children and their caregivers; lead levels in saliva of children and saliva and blood (finger prick) of the main caregivers; dietary intake; and genetic, behavioral, social and bacteriologic risk factors of periodontal disease in adults. Using information from 3 core research projects, the investigators propose to develop a tailored multi-media educational intervention (Project #3), based on the transtheoretical model of behavioral change, which will be administered using a randomized controlled design in year 4 of funding, just prior to the second examination phase. Additionally, the center will evaluate the impact on access to dental care of the state-funded experiment on utilization where Medicaid children are managed like privately insured patients (Project #4). The center will support health professionals from the DDH and VODI and the University of Detroit Mercy to receive research training. Doctoral students in three programs targeting minorities in the Schools of Public health and Social Work will be offered stipends to conduct research on health disparities. All families will have access to dental care in a DDH dental clinic (funded by DDH, HRSA, Delta Dental of Michigan and VODI).

"Examining Disparities in Child Dental Medicaid  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The candidate is currently a fellow in Pediatric Dentistry completing a Ph.D in Health Policy Analysis with additional advanced training in health services research. She has a long established history of commitment and interest in research and academic dentistry.  This application proposes a comprehensive interdisciplinary program wherein the candidate would receive the necessary training and mentorship to develop into an independent investigator. Two phases are described. In the first phase (Scholarly Development) Dr. Lee will work under the mentorship of Dr. R. Gary Rozier and a research advisory committee to complete the first part of the study. In the second phase (Faculty Transition) the candidate will work more independently to complete the second part of the proposal and build upon this research to seek additional funding. This will assist in the transition towards becoming an independent investigator. The research component will examine disparities in access to oral health care for pre-school aged children enrolled in Medicaid.   The current level of oral health service utilization in Medicaid has presented a major public policy challenge as evident by reports from the Office of Technology Assessment, the General Accounting Office and the Office of the Surgeon General. Medicaid is the country's largest investment in improving access and decreasing oral health problems of young low-income children. It has been established that low-income, minority, rural children have a disproportionately higher level of dental disease, but very little is known about their use of and access to oral health services. This research proposal will be the first to systematically study racial and geographic disparities and their interactions with each other and Medicaid enrollment on utilization, treatment outcomes and expenditures among pre-school aged children.   Four large databases will be used: Composite birth records from 1992, Medicaid enrollment and claims files from 1992-97, and the Area Resource File. This longitudinal cohort study treats the child as the unit of analysis. The data set will contain multiple observations per child-that is one observation for each year until the fifth birthday. Panel data techniques, specifically random effects models, will be incorporated into the estimation equations. Complex and hierarchical modeling will be used in the analyses. While controlling for predisposing and enabling characteristics, we will examine disparities on different outcome measures; 1) any oral health utilization 2) extent of utilization 3) type of visit 4) avoidable hospitalizations and source of care 5) dental related Medicaid expenditures. We will also examine quality performance measures as established by the NCQA expert panel.

"Northwest/Alaska Cent. to Reduce Oral Health Disparities This proposal is in response to RFD DE-99-003 to establish the Northwest and Alaska Center for Oral Health Disparity for research to reduce oral health disparities in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska.  It is proposed that the Center develop basic and applied knowledge that addresses the needs of poor, minority, and rural children and their caretakers, utilizing approaches that go beyond the traditional strategies from dental public health that have not found success in these populations. While the research in the proposed center may involve traditional dental personnel, it also stresses the roles of pediatricians, mothers as well as children; and preventive agents beyond fluorides. Participants include Alaska Natives, Native Americans from the Yakima Indian Nation, Hispanics from the agricultural areas of Washington, African Americans and Hispanics from the local military reservations, Hispanics and Pacific Islanders served by urban hospitals as well as rural and low-income Whites. We propose to accomplish this goal through five specific aims: (1) To address the needs of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska by conducting clinical research to evaluate the efficacy of non- traditional interventions to prevent and treat oral disease in children and their caretakers; (2) To develop community-based research that translates existing knowledge and new information regarding children and their caretakers into new technologies and interventions that hold promise for reducing disparities in these high risk populations; (3) To expand health science education and research training opportunities for minority populations in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska by collaborations with key minority educational and health serving institutions in the region; (4) To conduct basic research to further understand the role of host defenses and genetic bases for caries and periodontal disease affect underserved populations as well as to probe the biologic basis for antibacterial that change disease susceptibility; and (5) To increase the impact of the center beyond the projects included in this proposal by recruiting investigators and students from minority institutions in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska and prioritizing and encouraging pilot and center-affiliated studies in which they are involved. The collaborating institutions and partners are Heritage College (Hispanic and Native American-serving institution sited on the Yakima Indian Nation), Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium/Yukon-Kuskokwim Native Health Corporation, Yakima Valley Farm Workers Clinic, Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board/Northwest Tribal Epidemiology Center, Washington Dental Service an Foundation (major private dental insurer); and Medical Assistance Administration (Medicaid agency for Washington State).

"Child, Family, and Community Influences on Oral Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this application is to conceptually and empirically describe risk indicators for children's oral health outcomes using a new large scale national survey of children (ages 2-18) conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and merged with other supplementary databases. Our purpose is consistent with the one described in PAR-04-091; we will be conducting secondary data analysis of parent reported oral health data using an existing database, and studying individual, family and community-level factors that have not been studied together previously using population-based data. The two specific aims of this project are to develop: 1) a conceptual model of the child level, family level and community level influences on children's oral health and 2) a set of empirical analyses designed to describe, via statistical associations, the characteristics of children at the greatest risk of developing oral health problems, thus furthering our understanding of oral health disparities. Accomplishing these specific aims will provide helpful information for dental care practitioners, families, federal and state health  policymakers, and dental health services researchers about child, family and community level influences on oral health and oral health disparities. The analyses will also provide new information on the extent to which oral health disparities exist by race/ethnicity and by income. The empirical analyses will use the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health, a new population-based survey of approximately 102,000 children nationwide, including independent samples of approximately 2,000 children in each state and the District of Columbia. Multilevel and survey sampling modeling methods will be used in the empirical analysis.

"Predicting Caries Risk in Underserved Toddlers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): According to the first-ever Surgeon General's report on oral health in North America (2000), dental caries is the most common chronic childhood disease. In addition, most (75-80%) of the severe caries problems in children in this country occur in a small segment of the population (20-25%), and this problem is particularly prevalent in minorities and immigrants. These affected children are also often found in the lower socioeconomic strata and commonly develop caries at a very early age. Therefore, it is imperative that early in life a child is assessed to identify and eventually treat those children who are at greatest risk for the development of Early Childhood Caries (ECC), preferably before disease development. The purpose of this exploratory study is to develop an innovative self-administered structured caries risk questionnaire to identify toddlers (18-36 months of age) at the highest risk of developing ECC, focusing on at-risk population groups (e.g., African American and Hispanic). The focus will be to identify the caries risk behaviors that the primary caregiver and child have, the impact that their knowledge on oral health has on these factors, and the influence that perceptions of their dental health have on seeking dental care. A range of social, cultural, functional, psychological, socio-demographic, dietary and biological factors that may affect transmission, development of caries, general health, and access to care in these populations will be included. The questionnaire will be developed in three phases. Phase 1 will involve refinement of an initial draft by dental peers and a focus group of target primary caregivers. In Phase 2, this revised version will be then used in a large test population (400 primary caregivers/child pairs). A strength of this proposal is that it will use as the outcome variable for predictive modeling (Phase 3), the detection and 12-month monitoring of early, precavitated caries lesions, using two of the most innovative and sensitive methods for caries detection and monitoring, the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) and the Quantitative Light induced Fluorescence system (QLF), which will allow for a more accurate assessment of disease development and progression over time than traditional level of cavity detection.            ",Predicting Caries Risk in Underserved Toddlers,6949718,R21DE016451,"['pediatrics ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' dental caries ', ' dental disorder diagnosis ', ' oral health ', ' preventive dentistry ', ' early diagnosis ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' self care ', ' caregiver ', ' patient care management ', ' health care service utilization ', ' human subject ', ' dental survey ', ' health behavior ', ' ethnic group ', ' socioeconomics ', ' method development ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' focus group ', ' ']",NIDCR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R21,2005,151500,0.2026673746900468

"Rural Older Adults: Oral Health, Diet & Quality of Life DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral health is central to physical and psychosocial well-being. Oral health deficits affect nutritional status through constraining dietary choices, and they can impair social interaction and integration due to pain, communication disorders, and embarrassment. While advances in preventive dentistry over the past half century have been dramatic, disparities in oral health continue to exist. Older rural adults are a particularly high risk population for oral health disparities; many have had limited access to oral health care services, high poverty rates and low socioeconomic status which place them at risk for oral health deficits relative to their urban and suburban counterparts. The high proportion of ethnic minorities among rural elders in some parts of the US makes disparities in oral health status within rural populations likely. This competing continuation application (R01 AG13469), which builds on eight years of community-based research on nutritional self-management and nutritional status in two rural, multi-ethnic North Carolina counties, has the overall goal of documenting the impact of oral health on multiple domains of life for rural adults > 60 years by accomplishing four specific aims: (1) to document the oral health status of older rural adults in a multi-ethnic population, and its association with gender, ethnicity, and other demographic predictors; (2) to delineate the nutritional impact of deficits in oral health, including food selection, food preparation, food consumption, nutrient intake, and nutritional status; (3) to document the relationship of oral health to social functioning, including communication and social interaction; and (4) to assess the impact of oral health on perceived well-being/quality of life (QoL, directly and as mediated by dietary intake and social functioning. Building on a foundation of community ethnography begun in 1996, this project will achieve its specific aims using a multi-method approach that integrates the results of qualitative research with older adults (in-depth interviews with 36 older adults experiencing oral health deficits) with a cross-sectional random epidemiological survey (n=750) and clinical examination (dentate only, n=450) of oral health and its consequences for nutritional status and quality of life among a tri-ethnic (African American, Native American and white) largely disadvantaged population of older adults.

"Detroit Oral Cancer Prevention Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Detroit Oral Cancer Prevention Project is designed based on the extensive epidemiological analysis of the incidence, mortality, and early detection rates in Michigan (MI) during the last decade. African-American (AA) males in Detroit/Wayne County have the highest incidence and mortality rates in MI. The oral cancer survival rates of AA in Detroit have not changed significantly during the last 30 years; and smoking and alcohol use are relatively higher than the national average. Our analysis of data obtained from healthcare providers in community health centers show that 44% of the providers had high knowledge level on oral cancer and they identified high need for CE programs. About 70% of providers reported that they screen for oral cancer; yet there has not been a wide adoption of the one sheet screening form that was prepared specifically for these clinics by our program. A literature review identified that screening for cancers can be increased if a comprehensive media campaign and community outreach programs are implemented (Push-Pull Strategy). The aim of the Detroit Oral Cancer Prevention project is to achieve Healthy People 2010 Objectives. In Detroit (test site), a two-year media campaign will include radio and newspaper advertisements and outdoor signs that will promote early screening, tobacco cessation and reduction in drinking of alcohol. The media campaign will be coordinated with a community outreach educational program conducted in collaboration with churches and 144 local neighborhood organizations; an 800-toll free information telephone service will be available 16 hours per day for 5 days to provide information and schedule patients for free screening at a network of clinics to be available for 5 days per week. Additionally reminder postcards will be mailed to healthcare and dental providers in Detroit to emphasize the need for screening, tobacco cessation and, reduction in drinking of alcohol. In the seven comparison counties, with relatively high concentration of AA) only the reminder cards will be mailed. All healthcare and dental providers (test and comparison counties) will be offered CME or CDE courses (online and via scheduled courses) twice a year in each area. The changes in oral cancer incidence, mortality and early detection rates in Detroit and the comparison counties will be evaluated by the data collected by SEER and the Michigan Cancer Registry.

"Oral health disparities in the first 4 decades of life DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective: The proposed research aims to use a life-course approach to develop a better understanding of the interplay of biological, environmental and behavioral determinants and antecedents of oral conditions from childhood to oral health by elucidating the nature, scale, persistence and potential mutability of oral health disparities in a population-based cohort of adults.      Methods: The Dunedin Study has traced the development of a representative 1972 birth cohort of 1,000 New Zealand men and women at birth and ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21 and 26. New data will be gathered at age 31, enabling analysis of oral health disparities data from childhood to age 31. The research will: (1) document the natural history of oral conditions through to the 4th decade of life; (2) examine the influence of earlier SES (and SES transitions) on adult oral health; (3) using periodontal disease as a model, test hypotheses about gene-environment interactions in the origins of poor adult oral health; and (4) determine the extent to which poor oral health is an important contributor to (a) poor physical health and (b) experience of adverse life outcomes by the 4th decade of life. The planned research will provide unique information on the scale, persistence and potential mutability of disparities in oral health through the first four decades of life, and will assist in identifying those clinical, public health and policy interventions, which are likely to be most appropriate and efficacious in reducing oral health disparities. The Dunedin Study offers a unique opportunity to conduct such an investigation because of the comprehensive data archive, which has already been assembled.      Implications: The persistence of oral health disparities has not been investigated through the entire life course to date, and close examination of the degree to which the Dunedin cohort's early-life disparities in oral health persist into adulthood would be invaluable in determining whether (and to what extent) such inequalities can be reduced by clinical, public health or policy interventions. The outcome of this important work will inform and determine the nature of measures which are taken to reduce oral health disparities.

"Linking Mother and Child Access to Dental Care DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator):  Background. Healthy People 2010 and the U.S. Surgeon General's report, Oral Health in America, indicate that caries is a severe oral health problem among low-income, minority preschool children that is compounded by low access to dental care.  Potential solutions to this problem may exist in the linkage between mother and child access to dental care.  If low-income mothers have a regular source of dental care (RSDC), oral health benefits may accrue to both mother and child through biological and dental care mechanisms, but little is known about these associations.      Aims.  Among children aged three-to-six years old and enrolled in Medicaid dental insurance in Washington state (N=115,853), study aims are: 1) to measure the percentage of mothers with a RSDC and identify the determinants of mothers having a RSDC; 2) among mothers, to determine whether having a RSDC is associated with greater dental knowledge, oral health behaviors, dental satisfaction, better self-reported oral health, and less reparative treatment and work loss due to dental care; 3) among children, to determine whether having a mother with a RSDC is associated with greater utilization of dental care and better oral health; and 4) among children, to determine whether children with mothers losing dental coverage have less dental utilization than other children.      Methods.  Aims will be achieved through a prospective cohort study design composed of a baseline survey of mothers and one-year follow-up of children's dental utilization from Medicaid dental claims.  Disproportionate stratified random sampling will select Medicaid households with children aged three-to-six years in four racial/ethnic strata (White non-Hispanic (n=3,050), Hispanic (n=4,511), African-American (n=6,100), and other race/ethnic groups (n=4,518).  At least 780 sampled mothers will complete a baseline telephone or mail survey.  One year later, Medicaid dental claims for one-year pre/post-survey will be extracted for sampled children.  Separate regression analyses will be conducted for each racial/ethnic stratum.  Aim 1 analyses will identify factors associated with mothers having a RSDC.  Aim 2 analyses of mothers will determine the association between having a RSDC and knowledge and attitudes about dental care, oral health behaviors, and dental utilization.  Aim 3 analyses of children will determine whether having a mother with a RSDC is associated with greater dental utilization in the prospective year.  Aim 4 analyses of children will determine whether mothers' loss of dental insurance results in fewer children dental utilization.

"Access/Utilization of Dental Care by Homeless Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Homelessness in the United States has significantly increased with female-headed homeless families (FHHF) representing the fastest growing group of homeless people. The Surgeon General's report, Oral Health in America, declared dental caries the ""silent epidemic,"" with the worst oral health found among the poor of all ages. This prospective repeated measures study will identify predictors of oral health access, utilization of needed oral health services, and oral health status for homeless children, and determine whether shelter-based care increases utilization in FHHF. A convenience sample of 100 mother/child dyads will be recruited from a homeless shelter for the regression analysis. Predictor factors, based on the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, being measured upon enrollment are: age, oral health beliefs, ethnicity, education, family size, number of times homeless, victimization, substance abuse, mental health concerns, initial oral health status, and insurance status. The mother/child dyad will be followed up one month later and outcomes will be measured. The proposed study will also describe and measure upon enrollment the level of health and oral health status of homeless children residing at a shelter. The results of the study will identify significant predictors of oral health access/utilization and oral health status in homeless children guiding nursing strategies in shelters to reduce health disparities among underserved populations.

"Examining Disparities in Child Dental Medicaid  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The candidate is currently a fellow in Pediatric Dentistry completing a Ph.D in Health Policy Analysis with additional advanced training in health services research. She has a long established history of commitment and interest in research and academic dentistry.  This application proposes a comprehensive interdisciplinary program wherein the candidate would receive the necessary training and mentorship to develop into an independent investigator. Two phases are described. In the first phase (Scholarly Development) Dr. Lee will work under the mentorship of Dr. R. Gary Rozier and a research advisory committee to complete the first part of the study. In the second phase (Faculty Transition) the candidate will work more independently to complete the second part of the proposal and build upon this research to seek additional funding. This will assist in the transition towards becoming an independent investigator. The research component will examine disparities in access to oral health care for pre-school aged children enrolled in Medicaid.   The current level of oral health service utilization in Medicaid has presented a major public policy challenge as evident by reports from the Office of Technology Assessment, the General Accounting Office and the Office of the Surgeon General. Medicaid is the country's largest investment in improving access and decreasing oral health problems of young low-income children. It has been established that low-income, minority, rural children have a disproportionately higher level of dental disease, but very little is known about their use of and access to oral health services. This research proposal will be the first to systematically study racial and geographic disparities and their interactions with each other and Medicaid enrollment on utilization, treatment outcomes and expenditures among pre-school aged children.   Four large databases will be used: Composite birth records from 1992, Medicaid enrollment and claims files from 1992-97, and the Area Resource File. This longitudinal cohort study treats the child as the unit of analysis. The data set will contain multiple observations per child-that is one observation for each year until the fifth birthday. Panel data techniques, specifically random effects models, will be incorporated into the estimation equations. Complex and hierarchical modeling will be used in the analyses. While controlling for predisposing and enabling characteristics, we will examine disparities on different outcome measures; 1) any oral health utilization 2) extent of utilization 3) type of visit 4) avoidable hospitalizations and source of care 5) dental related Medicaid expenditures. We will also examine quality performance measures as established by the NCQA expert panel.

"Observed Factors Affecting Prevention in Dental Practice    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identification of mutable factors associated with the delivery of preventive services by dentists in general practice is the subject of this study. Identification of such factors will lead to the design, implementation, and evaluation of interventions that will improve preventive services provided in general dental practice. The conceptual framework for factor identification is that provided by Andersen in the Behavioral Model of Health Services Use. This study of dental practice will be focused on 120 Ohio dental practices that are part of the first dental practice research network to be organized in the United States. The methodology includes a direct observation technique developed at UC Davis and utilized at CWRU for the study of Family Medical Practice. Data concerning dental practice will be gathered by two teams of dental hygienists observing dentists and hygienists in each office for 3 days. Approximately 6000 patient visits will be observed. The direct observation will utilize the Davis Observation Code, a well-tested instrument to record physician behavior, adapted to dental practice. Data also will be collected utilizing information from patient questionnaires, practitioner surveys, billing data, and qualitative reporting. Comparison of information gathered by different methods will indicate the least expensive accurate methods for collecting various kinds of information about dental practice. Hypotheses will be tested concerning the association of preventive service delivery with risk for oral disease, delivery of esthetic services, dentists' beliefs about the importance of tobacco counseling, the socioeconomic status of patients, and the ethnicity of the dentist. This first large scale study utilizing a dental practice research network will provide statistically significant data concerning factors that influence provision of preventive services (counseling and procedures) to patients in actual practice settings.         ",Observed Factors Affecting Prevention in Dental Practice,6819241,R01DE015171,"['dental health service ', ' dental personnel ', ' preventive dentistry ', ' health care quality ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' human subject ', ' dental survey ', ' African American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDCR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,852809,0.1281730752001005
"Development of an Oral Health Literacy Instrument    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early childhood caries (ECC) is a major health problem that has a disproportionate effect on minority and disadvantaged children. An underlying contributor to this problem is parental behaviors that appear to be inconsistent with good oral health literacy. The purpose of this study is to begin the process of developing and evaluating an oral health literacy instrument that can be used by primary medical care and oral health care providers to assess the degree to which parents/guardians have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic oral health information and services needed to make appropriate decisions that have a direct impact on the oral health of their preschool children. The development of an initial version of the oral health literacy assessment instrument will be in three phases. Phase I will consist of defining the construct of oral health literacy via a Delphi process conducted with 8-10 identified oral health experts. Phase II will consist of constructing a draft assessment instrument. Phase III will employ in-depth cognitive interviewing of 8-10 parents/guardians from each of four socio-culturally distinct population groups (African American, Appalachian, Hispanic/Latino, and white, non-Appalachian, non-Hispanic/Latino) to identify potential problems that might lead to survey response error. The instrument will then be pilot-tested in two pediatric safety-net facilities that have implemented a program of oral health screening and fluoride varnish application for preschool children. Approximately 300 parents/guardians of children 0-5 years of age who provide informed consent will be asked to complete the oral health literacy assessment instrument and four additional brief surveys. Data from these surveys as well as data collected on the oral health status of children as part of the oral health screening/fluoride varnish program will be used in various psychometric analyses to assess the reliability and validity of the instrument.         ",Development of an Oral Health Literacy Instrument,6959779,R03DE017089,"['pediatrics ', ' infant human (0-1 year) ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' dental caries ', ' topical fluoride therapy ', ' oral health ', ' preventive dentistry ', ' mass screening ', ' parent ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' dental survey ', ' health behavior ', ' decision making ', ' psychometrics ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,R03,2005,76750,0.21923574414541838

"Biotech & Materials Research to Reduce Caries Disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R13 conference grant proposal aims to: (1) Produce a state-of-the-art assessment of the public health approaches and their limitations in preventing early childhood dental caries in disparity populations. Important in this assessment will be differentiating applied problems of engineering and technology versus fundamental science. (2) Assess recent emerging research in the prevention of dental caries including: specific species bacterial adhesion prevention, biofilm ecology manipulation, circumvention of sucrose driven acid production, genetically engineered antibiotic production in situ, and fluoride- and other antimicrobial-release coatings. (3) Promote a dialogue between end-users, oral microbiologists, and materials and bioengineering experts in order to develop novel prevention technologies and implement the transfer of such technologies to industry and practice. (4) Address the question of what can be done to more effectively use the large body of basic and applied caries science already available to speed solutions to the public health community. (5) Develop a research agenda that will help state, federal, and private funding agencies identify critical research needs; not only for novel technological solutions but also on outreach mechanisms to transfer such novel technologies to industry and public health practice. The rationale for the workshop is that science and technology have not produced sufficient practical tools for public health practitioners and the private delivery system to address the plague of dental caries that exists for children and adults from families with low incomes and for numerous ethnic minority and racial groups. The 2 1/2 day conference is to be held July 11-17 in Seattle and involve participants from basic and applied academic dental research, bioengineering and biotechnology, government, and industry.

"Oral Health Disparities Among High-Risk Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award for Monica Fisher, DDS, MS, MPH, PhD. This award would allow Dr. Fisher to meet her long-term career goal to conduct productive and innovative patient-oriented research that focuses on oral health disparities and treatment effectiveness among high-risk populations. An immediate career goal is to gain additional expertise relevant to research on oral health disparities among high-risk populations.      We propose 3 aims related to career development and 4 related to the research plan. Dr. Fisher's career development aims are to: (1) obtain advanced biostatistical training; (2) increase analytical expertise in the areas of treatment effectiveness and smoking as a major risk factor for oral disease and its systemic effects; and (3) use these findings as preliminary data for subsequent R03 and R01 grant applications. The Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health highlights the imperative for rigorous studies on oral health disparities in high-risk populations, studies on smoking as a major risk factor, and studies on linkages between oral and general health. Therefore, the research plan comprises investigations of oral health disparities among high-risk populations (data from the Florida Dental Care Study) and persons with systemic conditions (data from the third National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey). The specific aims of the research plan are to test hypotheses that among highrisk populations: (4) dental care is effective in facilitating recovery and preventing oral health-related quality of life decrements, but varies by race and socioeconomic status (SES); (5) dental care is effective in facilitating recovery and preventing oral diseases, but varies by race and SES; (6) periodontal disease is associated with heart disease and glycemic control in diabetics, in analyses restricted to non-smokers; (7) self-reported need for a dental cleaning is associated with heart disease and glycemic control in diabetics, in analyses restricted to non-smokers. This activity will take place in highly supportive research environments. Co-mentors Gregg Gilbert, DDS, MBA, Mark Litaker, PhD, and George Taylor, DMD, DrPH, national experts in their fields, will supervise Dr. Fisher's research and career development. The proposed plans will intensify and focus Dr. Fisher's career development, and make innovative, methodologically sophisticated contributions to the literature.

"An innovative psychoeducational method & ECC prevention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are profound disparities in Early Childhood Caries (ECC) experiences such that children from minority and low-income families suffer a disproportionate share of the disease burden. Many authors recommend educational interventions as one mean of preventing ECC. However, such previous interventions have been only moderately effective and the dental literature still lacks more comprehensive preventive approaches using psychological and behavioral strategies. Thus, the goal of this proposed study is to explore an innovative psychoeducational intervention as a preventive approach for ECC in low-income toddlers enrolled in the WIC supplemental nutritional program. Self-Determination Theory will provide the theoretical support for the psychoeducational intervention to facilitate motivation through people's three innate psychological needs: autonomy, competence and relatedness. Specifically, the study will test a psychoeducational intervention for the prevention of ECC, as well as gather a variety of caries risk pilot data from low-income toddlers enrolled at WIC. Collection of pilot data in this population will allow our research team and others to (1) to examine whether mothers exposed to an autonomy-supportive message will demonstrate changes in self-reported knowledge, behavioral intent and subsequent behavior concerning their child's oral health, and (2) to determine the extent to which their child will present with positive oral health outcomes, such as low levels of Streptococcus mutans, incisor plaque and dental caries. We will collect data on caries occurrence, children's dietary and oral hygiene habits, fluoride exposures, saliva transmission from mother to child, and mothers' self-reported knowledge, behavioral intent, and subsequent behavior concerning their child's oral health. With data from this pilot study, investigators will be able to assess the impact of this innovative intervention on mothers of high-ECC risk children. If successful, widespread use of this psychoeducational intervention could have a profound impact in efforts to reduce oral health disparities.         ",An innovative psychoeducational method & ECC prevention,6950437,R21DE016483,"['preschool child (1-5) ', ' dental caries ', ' dental plaque ', ' dental disorder diagnosis ', ' oral health ', ' preventive dentistry ', ' tooth brushing ', ' dental health education ', ' mother child interaction ', ' fluorine ', ' human subject ', ' videotape /videodisc ', ' questionnaire ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' diet ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' health behavior ', ' behavioral habituation /sensitization ', ' motivation ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' human therapy evaluation ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' behavior therapy ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2005,258125,0.27853511321788244
"Oral Health and Quality of Life in Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health stressed the significance of understanding how to bring oral health care to those segments of the US population that need it most, but are underserved. Children from socio economically disadvantaged backgrounds are one of these groups. Gaining a clearer understanding of how to improve their situation is the overall objective of this proposal. The concrete aims are (a) to validate the self report version and the parent/guardian (proxy) version of the Michigan Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (MOHRQOL) Scale for children (Aim 1), (b) to design and validate a short screening version of this instrument that parents/guardians and teachers can use to identify children in need for oral health care (Aim 2), (c) to identify the factors that ultimately determine parents'/guardians' decisions to seek oral health care for a child (Aim 3), and (d) to develop and evaluate educational material for parents/guardians and teachers/school administrators to alert them to the importance of regular preventive oral health care for elementary school age children as well as how to obtain reparative care once a child in need is identified (Aim 4). In order to investigate these aims, a research project is proposed that collects data from elementary school children, their parents/guardians, and teachers. In Study 1, survey data will be collected (a) from elementary school age children from underprivileged backgrounds about their ohrqol (N=3,000), and (b) from their parents/guardians (N=400) about their child's oral health, oral health care needs, and oral health-related quality of life. The children's oral health will be determined in oral exams. This study is used to validate the MOHRQOL - child and parent (proxy) versions (Aim 1), and to do a test-item analysis to identify the items that can be used in a screening instrument for parents and teachers. In Study 2, teachers (N=300) will be surveyed to assess their awareness of how oral health problems might interfere with learning, and whether they can identify when this is the case. In Year 2, the screening versions of the MOHRQOL for parents / guardians and teachers will be validated (Aim 2) by conducting Study 3. This study collects oral health data from children (N=3,000), as well as data collected with the screening instrument from children, parents/guardians (N=400), and teachers (N=300). Study 4 is designed as a focus group study with parents/guardians and teachers. Its goal is to identify the factors that shape parents'/guardians' decisions to seek oral health care for a child (Aim 3), and determine which informational needs parents and teachers have concerning children's oral health. Based on these findings, educational material for parents/guardians and teachers will be developed and its effectiveness will be evaluated in Study 5, a survey study of parents' (N=400) and teachers' (N=300) evaluations of the educational materials (Aim 4).         ",Oral Health and Quality of Life in Children,6927898,R01DE014887,"['middle childhood (6-11) ', ' dental disorder diagnosis ', ' oral health ', ' preventive dentistry ', ' health education ', ' parent ', ' medical outreach /case finding ', ' health care referral /consultation ', ' health care service utilization ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care cost /financing ', ' human subject ', ' information dissemination ', ' interview ', ' questionnaire ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' health survey ', ' ethnic group ', ' socioeconomics ', ' quality of life ', ' teacher ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' educational resource design /development ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' focus group ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2005,323351,0.27011598084565286
"Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health A Center Addressing Disparities in Children's Oral Health is proposed at the University of California, San Francisco, with two primary institutional partners serving minority populations, the San Francisco Department of Public Health and the San Ysidro Community Health Center, a model health center located near the US-Mexican border, and additional collaborating institutions. The theme for this Center is to understand, prevent, and reduce oral health disparities among young children, with a primary focus on preventing early childhood caries. A secondary theme is to understand the interactions between the oral health and medical delivery systems that can affect children's oral health. These goals will be pursued from two primary directions: retrospective data- based projects to increase our understanding of the etiology of oral health disparities and to identify children most susceptible, and intervention projects to prevent disease. In this center we will 1) Support primarily patient and population-oriented research related to reducing oral health disparities in children; 2) Establish core facilities to provide technical services and resources to Center-affiliated projects; 3) Provide an enriched environment for training future health-care professionals and scientists, especially those from under-represented groups; 4) Establish mechanisms to increase collaboration among investigators in Center- supported projects, across health professions and affiliated collaborating public and private institutions on the west coast. Findings from this project will 1) identify cultural, environmental, workforce, behavioral, and biologic factors associated with health disparities among the ethnic/racial groups in the very diverse California environment; 2) enhance our ability to target children likely to be at risk for dental caries; 3) provide successful interdisciplinary interventions to prevent disease and reduce oral health disparities.

"Molecular Analysis of the Biofilm in Caries and Health DESCRIPTION: Dental caries is the most common chronic disease of childhood, and is the biggest unmet health care need among America's children. Socioeconomic disparities in both rates of disease and treatment are a major public health issue. To date, effective biological interventions to prevent caries have not been developed. Dental plaque contains several hundred different organisms, many of which are poorly studied. A number of species have been shown to produce sufficient acid to drive pH below critical levels and to tolerate low pH. Research has primarily focused on Streptococcus mutans as the etiologic agent in caries, but based the work of previous investigators using cultivation and on our preliminary findings using molecular methods, S. mutans is not always present in caries, is often found at low levels, and additional and unexpected bacterial species may be important. In addition, comparatively little attention has been paid to identifying health-associated and potentially beneficial bacterial species that may reside in the oral cavity. For the proposed project, bacterial species present in childhood caries and health will be identified by cloning and sequencing bacterial 16S ribosomal genes amplified from DNA isolated from plaque samples. This open ended approach will allow the detection and identification of all bacterial species present, including novel, uncultivated or unexpected species. The presence and quantities of the species identified by this approach as potentially associated with caries or health will then be determined using quantitative, real-time PCR. This dual-technique approach will allow the examination of a much larger sample size than is possible by cloning and sequencing alone. Accomplishment of the proposed studies will identify the pathogens associated with the onset and progression of severe caries of the primary and young permanent dentition, and identify those bacterial species associated with a healthy dentition. This study will also provide a comprehensive catalog of the supragingival flora in children based on molecular technology. The significance of the proposed work is that identification of additional caries pathogens would provide alternative targets for biological interventions, and identification of beneficial health-associated species could provide the basis for therapeutic interventions to establish caries-resistant microbial communities.

"Detroit Center for Research on Oral Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant) - The Detroit Center for Research on Oral Health Disparities aims to promote oral health and reduce disparities within the community of low-income African American children (0-5 years) and their main caregivers (14 + years) living in the City of Detroit. The driving theme of the center's research program is to identify determinants and design interventions to answer the following question: why do some low-income African American children and their main caregivers have better oral health than others who live in the same community? The proposed center will focus on studying intra-group disparities in oral health. The community based partners, the City of Detroit Department of Health (DDH) and the Voices of Detroit Initiative (VODI) have strongly supported this theme. The Center will include 3 support cores, 5 research core projects and 1 pilot study. The Center's Methodology Core will select a multistage random sample of African American families living in the poorest 39 Census Tracts in the City of Detroit. A total of 1,529 families will be sampled and interviewed in their homes. It is estimated that 994 families will be examined at community centers in year 2 (2002) funding. Based on extensive data collected by the investigative team (R01 MH58299) in Detroit, the investigators predict that 760 families will be retained by the third examination phase in year 6 (2006). The research teams will investigate the social characteristics of parents, families, and neighborhoods, that are associated with disparities in oral health (dental caries and periodontal diseases) of children and their caregivers; lead levels in saliva of children and saliva and blood (finger prick) of the main caregivers; dietary intake; and genetic, behavioral, social and bacteriologic risk factors of periodontal disease in adults. Using information from 3 core research projects, the investigators propose to develop a tailored multi-media educational intervention (Project #3), based on the transtheoretical model of behavioral change, which will be administered using a randomized controlled design in year 4 of funding, just prior to the second examination phase. Additionally, the center will evaluate the impact on access to dental care of the state-funded experiment on utilization where Medicaid children are managed like privately insured patients (Project #4). The center will support health professionals from the DDH and VODI and the University of Detroit Mercy to receive research training. Doctoral students in three programs targeting minorities in the Schools of Public health and Social Work will be offered stipends to conduct research on health disparities. All families will have access to dental care in a DDH dental clinic (funded by DDH, HRSA, Delta Dental of Michigan and VODI).

"Oral Health Problems of BPD and VLBW adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Very little is known from prior literature about the relationship between very low birth weight (VLBW), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and dental caries in the permanent dentition, due to the fact that only recently are increasing numbers surviving to adolescence because of improved neonatal technology. Both dental caries and VLBW disproportionately affect the poor and minority groups. It is known that VLBW children have a high prevalence of enamel defects in the primary dentition, which in turn can lead to increased susceptibility of the dental enamel to dental caries. The primary objective of this study is to assess the relationship between BPD, VLBW and caries in the permanent dentition of 14-year-old adolescents. Secondarily, we propose to explore the possible mechanisms underlying this relationship by looking at enamel defects, oral health behavior, and synergistic effects of these two factors. Approximately 302 children (110 VLBW with BPD, 80 VLBW without BPD, 112 term healthy) will be studied for dental problems in conjunction with an ongoing developmental study (primary study). The proposed study will collect data on outcome (dental caries), mediating (enamel defects, oral health behavior of child, oral hygiene status) and independent (oral health knowledge, parent's dental behavior) variables. The primary study will provide data on other independent variables such as medical, sociodemographic, parent stressors and cognitive variables. Data analysis includes ANOVA, GLIM procedures for the primary aim, and multivariate regression models for testing mediation effects. Our proposed study is expected to provide much needed data on the extent of oral health problems in the permanent dentition of VLBW adolescents, and to support the further development of an R01 application. The clinical implications include early diagnosis and treatment to prevent further susceptibility to tooth loss and other dental diseases. It is also of public health interest since interventions to target attitudes and oral health practices can be implemented in programs for special health needs children, and there by be useful for improving both oral and general health.            ",Oral Health Problems of BPD and VLBW adolescents,6944320,R21DE016469,"['pediatrics ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' dental caries ', ' oral health ', ' dentition ', ' tooth enamel ', ' preventive dentistry ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' dental health education ', ' human subject ', ' questionnaire ', ' health behavior ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' bronchopulmonary dysplasia ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' clinical research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDCR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2005,191250,0.3208082137595999
"Enhancing Oral Health Care Use by HIV-Positives DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent national studies demonstrate that oral health care is one of the highest unmet health care needs for HIV-positive (HIV+) individuals, although it is recognized as playing a critical role in the medical management of HIV/AIDS. Social and economic factors have contributed to less than optimal use of oral health services for HIV+s in the United States. According to recent data, from Miami-Dade County, Florida, only 24% of HIV+s served by Ryan White-funded medical clinics had obtained oral health services in the past 12 months.  To address the underutilization of oral health care services, we propose to develop, implement, and evaluate an intervention to assist low-income HIV+s in obtaining access to oral health services as well as increase appropriate utilization of these services. The intervention is a brief, client-centered case management intervention. The case management intervention is adapted from an intervention that has been previously tested in a CDC-funded, multi-site study designed to link recently diagnosed HIV+s to primary medical care.  A two-arm randomized trial among HIV+ individuals who are currently enrolled in HIV primary medical care, but not receiving oral health care, will be conducted to test the intervention. The two arms will consist of a case management intervention and standard-of-care. Participants will be assessed at baseline, and at 9 and 18 months after baseline, to document their utilization of oral health services. An interdisciplinary team of behavioral and clinical research scientists with experience in developing and evaluating health care and prevention interventions targeting low income, HIV+s will conduct this research.

"Symptom Interpretation & Oral Health among Harlem Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the oral health of the US population has greatly improved over the last three decades, significant disparities continue to exist among different subpopulations. The Surgeon General's report ""Oral Health in America"" published in 2000 revealed a hidden epidemic of oral diseases that is largely borne by these disadvantaged social groups. In the Harlem Household Survey, from among 50 health complaints about which respondents were questioned, problems with teeth or gums were the most frequently cited problem (30 percent). What remedial actions, if any, do disadvantaged individuals take when they experience oral symptoms or problems? While access to care is undoubtedly a critical determinant of the actions they will take, other factors much less well investigated or understood such as lay beliefs, attitudes and emotions (e.g., fear and threat) are also important. For example, the casual attributions they assign to their oral symptom/problems, will guide their coping responses including whether to seek formal dental care, attempt self care (including self-medication and treatment), or do nothing for now (i.e., delay action).   To gain better understanding of these issues, we propose to study the symptom appraisal processes and coping responses of non-Hispanic Black/African Americans residing in Central Harlem who have experienced an oral symptom within the last six months. Of particular interest, are the self-care behaviors used in response to oral problems. In the field of dental research, self-care has been looked at almost exclusively in terms of behaviors enacted by the individuals to prevent dental problems (i.e. oral health behaviors). Particularly brushing, flossing, use of interdental devices, use of mouthwashes, and regular dental visits. There is on the other hand, a dearth of research data self-care behavior in response to dental or oral symptom and problems (i.e., illness behavior), which is our focus in the proposed study.  In depth face-to-face, focused interviews will be conducted with 120 adults. As in several of the principal Investigator's previous federally funded investigations, qualitative research methods will be employed.

"Oral Health Outcomes of Early Childhood Malnutrition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objectives of this retrospective cohort study are to assess the impact of early protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) on the permanent dentition, specifically with respect to: 1) dental caries, 2) enamel hypoplasia, 3) tooth eruption timing, and 4) salivary function. The proposed investigation will seek to assess clear dose-response and temporal relationships between early childhood PEM (ages birth-5 years old) and these oral outcomes at ages 10-18 years. An explanatory model of enamel hypoplasia, salivary gland hypofunction, tooth eruption timing, and socioeconomic risk factors as possible mechanisms for caries following PEM exposure will be examined. The few existing published human studies of PEM and oral outcomes were typically of cross-sectional design, with limited control for confounding variables, and almost exclusively focused on the primary dentition. Until now, there has been no high quality data base of past PEM exposure with a sufficient lag period of 10 years or more to allow the study of early childhood malnutrition effects on the permanent dentition. This study will capitalize on a 'natural experiment situation' that has occurred in Haiti, i.e. a database of serial weightings of children in their first 5 years of life, who had experienced the full range of PEM, and will maximize the time since exposure for disease determination. PEM exposure will be assessed using weights included in an ongoing Haitian Health Foundation database maintained since 1988 on over 16,000 children. The completion of this natural experiment only requires the collection of the oral health data from a randomly selected sub-group of these 16,000 children, stratified by nutrition status according to the severity and chronicity of their exposure to PEM. A random sample of 10-18 year old children frequency matched for age and gender will be recruited from each PEM stratum, for a total sample of 1,250 children. The investigation will consist of a four-month-long field dental examination, saliva collection and interview survey by a calibrated team of U.S. and Haitian trained dentists and epidemiologists. The primary analyses will consist of regression models that will assess the associations between the four oral outcomes and PEM levels and socioeconomic factors, as well as determining age-specific critical PEM exposure(s). The findings of this study will provide the first scientific evidence regarding the potential effect of early childhood PEM on the complete permanent dentition based on a retrospective longitudinal cohort study. Given the universality of PEM pathophysiology, this study's findings will be generalizable to subsets of U.S. children having 9 oral health disparities.         ",Oral Health Outcomes of Early Childhood Malnutrition,6948282,R01DE014708,"['bioenergetics ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' middle childhood (6-11) ', ' dental caries ', ' oral health ', ' dentition ', ' tooth enamel ', ' dentistry ', ' pathologic process ', ' human subject ', ' questionnaire ', ' malnutrition ', ' protein deficiency ', ' salivary gland ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' early experience ', ' socioeconomics ', ' clinical research ', ' outcomes research ', ' ']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,605970,0.27129748342356486
"Northwest/Alaska Cent. to Reduce Oral Health Disparities This proposal is in response to RFD DE-99-003 to establish the Northwest and Alaska Center for Oral Health Disparity for research to reduce oral health disparities in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska.  It is proposed that the Center develop basic and applied knowledge that addresses the needs of poor, minority, and rural children and their caretakers, utilizing approaches that go beyond the traditional strategies from dental public health that have not found success in these populations. While the research in the proposed center may involve traditional dental personnel, it also stresses the roles of pediatricians, mothers as well as children; and preventive agents beyond fluorides. Participants include Alaska Natives, Native Americans from the Yakima Indian Nation, Hispanics from the agricultural areas of Washington, African Americans and Hispanics from the local military reservations, Hispanics and Pacific Islanders served by urban hospitals as well as rural and low-income Whites. We propose to accomplish this goal through five specific aims: (1) To address the needs of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska by conducting clinical research to evaluate the efficacy of non- traditional interventions to prevent and treat oral disease in children and their caretakers; (2) To develop community-based research that translates existing knowledge and new information regarding children and their caretakers into new technologies and interventions that hold promise for reducing disparities in these high risk populations; (3) To expand health science education and research training opportunities for minority populations in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska by collaborations with key minority educational and health serving institutions in the region; (4) To conduct basic research to further understand the role of host defenses and genetic bases for caries and periodontal disease affect underserved populations as well as to probe the biologic basis for antibacterial that change disease susceptibility; and (5) To increase the impact of the center beyond the projects included in this proposal by recruiting investigators and students from minority institutions in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska and prioritizing and encouraging pilot and center-affiliated studies in which they are involved. The collaborating institutions and partners are Heritage College (Hispanic and Native American-serving institution sited on the Yakima Indian Nation), Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium/Yukon-Kuskokwim Native Health Corporation, Yakima Valley Farm Workers Clinic, Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board/Northwest Tribal Epidemiology Center, Washington Dental Service an Foundation (major private dental insurer); and Medical Assistance Administration (Medicaid agency for Washington State).

"Selection Bias in Studies of Treatment Effectiveness  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application responds to the April 12, 2004 program announcement entitled ""N1DCR Small Research Grants for Data Analysis and Statistical Methodology (R03); PAR-04-091"". The Florida Dental Care Study (FDCS) is a prospective observational study of oral health and dental care based on a diverse, population-based sample including many subjects at increased risk for oral health disparities (e.g., African Americans, persons of low socioeconomic status, and persons whose approach to dental care is problem-oriented, rather than based on regular attendance). FDCS is the first study to use an innovative approach that directly links clinical exam data, self-reported dimensions of oral health, use of specific dental services, and diverse patient characteristics in a population-based sample of subjects who may or may not be regular attendees at dental clinics. This data set, which includes longitudinal observations across 72 months of follow-up, provides a unique database that is unprecedented in adult oral health disparities research, oral epidemiology, and dental health services research. So far, important hypotheses about the relationship between dental disease measured clinically, self-reported dimensions of oral health, health-related quality of life, and use of dental care have been tested. While the randomized trial has traditionally been considered the gold standard study design for evaluation of medical treatment effects, observational trials have important strengths. Observational studies allow evaluation of the effects of treatments for which randomized assignment is impossible, such as those for which subjects self-select into treatment groups, or for which a representative sample of the population of interest is not attainable. However, because subjects are not randomly assigned to receive treatment or not, observed group effects are likely to be confounded by characteristics, observed or not observed, other than the group difference that is of interest. This confounding leads to a potential for biased estimation of treatment differences, known as sample selection bias. The goals of this 2-year project are (1) to quantify the effects of sample selection bias on conclusions made about the effectiveness of specific types of dental services, using a broad range of oral health outcomes and treatment types, and (2) to measure whether these effects of selection bias in Specific Aim 1 differ by race, socioeconomic status, or typical approach to dental care (regular versus problem-oriented attendance).              ",Selection Bias in Studies of Treatment Effectiveness,6961479,R03DE016947,"['oral health ', ' dental health service ', ' dentistry ', ' preventive dentistry ', ' human subject ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' epidemiology ', ' bias ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R03,2005,145331,0.276633301380714
"Oral Health Disparities Among High-Risk Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award for Monica Fisher, DDS, MS, MPH, PhD. This award would allow Dr. Fisher to meet her long-term career goal to conduct productive and innovative patient-oriented research that focuses on oral health disparities and treatment effectiveness among high-risk populations. An immediate career goal is to gain additional expertise relevant to research on oral health disparities among high-risk populations.      We propose 3 aims related to career development and 4 related to the research plan. Dr. Fisher's career development aims are to: (1) obtain advanced biostatistical training; (2) increase analytical expertise in the areas of treatment effectiveness and smoking as a major risk factor for oral disease and its systemic effects; and (3) use these findings as preliminary data for subsequent R03 and R01 grant applications. The Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health highlights the imperative for rigorous studies on oral health disparities in high-risk populations, studies on smoking as a major risk factor, and studies on linkages between oral and general health. Therefore, the research plan comprises investigations of oral health disparities among high-risk populations (data from the Florida Dental Care Study) and persons with systemic conditions (data from the third National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey). The specific aims of the research plan are to test hypotheses that among highrisk populations: (4) dental care is effective in facilitating recovery and preventing oral health-related quality of life decrements, but varies by race and socioeconomic status (SES); (5) dental care is effective in facilitating recovery and preventing oral diseases, but varies by race and SES; (6) periodontal disease is associated with heart disease and glycemic control in diabetics, in analyses restricted to non-smokers; (7) self-reported need for a dental cleaning is associated with heart disease and glycemic control in diabetics, in analyses restricted to non-smokers.  This activity will take place in highly supportive research environments. Co-mentors Gregg Gilbert, DDS, MBA, Mark Litaker, PhD, and George Taylor, DMD, DrPH, national experts in their fields, will supervise Dr. Fisher's research and career development.

"Dental Plaque Accumulation as a Risk Factor for CHD DESCRIPTION: Infection is an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD), the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the US and worldwide. Oral disease is increasingly implicated in this capacity. This study will employ an acute disease model to determine whether dental plaque accumulation and the resultant gingivitis have systemic consequences with the potential to increase risk for CHD. Moreover, any variation in both the local and systemic responses between individuals will be identified using this model, thus contributing to our understanding of disparity in CHD risk. These responses may be governed by gender or race. The proposed study will be the first to address these issues using such methodology. The central hypothesis is that dental plaque accumulation will have systemic consequences, with the potential for increasing CHD risk.       The experimental gingivitis model will form the central core of this study. It permits a high level of experimental control, as inflammation develops in response to a localized bacterial challenge, and resolves upon withdrawal of the stimulus. The study will be conducted with the participation of a minimum of 100 healthy young adult subjects (equal numbers of male and female, and black and white). It will be divided into three phases: 1) The 21-day Control phase, during which individuals will perform meticulous plaque control; 2) the 21-day Experimental phase, during which individuals will abstain from all oral hygiene measures; and 3) the 21-day Recovery phase, during which oral hygiene measures will be re-instated. Throughout these phases, levels of dental plaque and resultant gingivitis will be assessed. Peripheral blood collection will permit the concomitant assessment of systemic elements purported to be associated with increased CHD risk (levels of inflammatory markers, markers of lipid metabolism, hemostatic factors and endotoxin, and the extent of neutrophil activation). The study design is longitudinal, and such that each subject will serve as their own control through the comparison of clinical and laboratory data collected on specific days throughout the study period. Furthermore, analysis will permit the identification of high- and Iow-responders, that is individuals exhibiting a significantly increased or decreased inflammatory response respectively, to a given local bacterial challenge. The extent to which gender and race influence this will also be addressed.       The results of this study will further understanding of the potential mechanistic role of oral disease in increasing CHD risk.

"Reducing Oral Cancer Disparities in Florida DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Florida bears a disproportionate burden from cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx: in 2000, Florida had the nation's second highest age-adjusted incidence rate for females and fifth-highest rate for males, and had the second highest number of new cases. Black/African American and white males in Florida experience comparable incidence rates, but blacks experience significantly higher mortality rates and lower survival rates, suggesting that earlier detection may help reduce racial disparities in prognosis. This project seeks to promote oral cancer awareness and early detection among blacks/African Americans in Florida through the following Specific Aims: (1) Use a social marketing approach to develop a mass-media campaign on oral and pharyngeal cancer for a population at high risk for incidence and mortality; (2) Increase the proportion of the target population that knows the major risk factors, signs, and symptoms of oral and pharyngeal cancer; and (3) Increase the proportion of the target population that receives a clinical examination for oral and pharyngeal cancer. Using a theory-based social marketing approach guided by preliminary study findings, this project will develop culturally-appropriate, research-based educational messages and materials. The project will use two approaches to increase oral cancer awareness, knowledge, and preventive behaviors among black/African American adults in northeast Florida: 1) a wide-scale mass media approach centered in Duval County but reaching all surrounding counties; and 2) a targeted, faith-based effort among a network of primarily African American churches in medically and dentally underserved areas in northeast Florida. A toll free telephone hotline will be available to provide additional information and links to clinical facilities for exams. County health departments in northeast Florida will provide oral cancer examinations at their facilities, and onsite examinations will be provided by dentists at participating churches. Effectiveness of the interventions will be measured through population-based surveys and utilization of the hotline and clinics.

"Examining Disparities in Child Dental Medicaid  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The candidate is currently a fellow in Pediatric Dentistry completing a Ph.D in Health Policy Analysis with additional advanced training in health services research. She has a long established history of commitment and interest in research and academic dentistry.  This application proposes a comprehensive interdisciplinary program wherein the candidate would receive the necessary training and mentorship to develop into an independent investigator. Two phases are described. In the first phase (Scholarly Development) Dr. Lee will work under the mentorship of Dr. R. Gary Rozier and a research advisory committee to complete the first part of the study. In the second phase (Faculty Transition) the candidate will work more independently to complete the second part of the proposal and build upon this research to seek additional funding. This will assist in the transition towards becoming an independent investigator. The research component will examine disparities in access to oral health care for pre-school aged children enrolled in Medicaid.   The current level of oral health service utilization in Medicaid has presented a major public policy challenge as evident by reports from the Office of Technology Assessment, the General Accounting Office and the Office of the Surgeon General. Medicaid is the country's largest investment in improving access and decreasing oral health problems of young low-income children. It has been established that low-income, minority, rural children have a disproportionately higher level of dental disease, but very little is known about their use of and access to oral health services. This research proposal will be the first to systematically study racial and geographic disparities and their interactions with each other and Medicaid enrollment on utilization, treatment outcomes and expenditures among pre-school aged children.   Four large databases will be used: Composite birth records from 1992, Medicaid enrollment and claims files from 1992-97, and the Area Resource File. This longitudinal cohort study treats the child as the unit of analysis. The data set will contain multiple observations per child-that is one observation for each year until the fifth birthday. Panel data techniques, specifically random effects models, will be incorporated into the estimation equations. Complex and hierarchical modeling will be used in the analyses. While controlling for predisposing and enabling characteristics, we will examine disparities on different outcome measures; 1) any oral health utilization 2) extent of utilization 3) type of visit 4) avoidable hospitalizations and source of care 5) dental related Medicaid expenditures. We will also examine quality performance measures as established by the NCQA expert panel.

"Observed Factors Affecting Prevention in Dental Practice    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identification of mutable factors associated with the delivery of preventive services by dentists in general practice is the subject of this study. Identification of such factors will lead to the design, implementation, and evaluation of interventions that will improve preventive services provided in general dental practice. The conceptual framework for factor identification is that provided by Andersen in the Behavioral Model of Health Services Use. This study of dental practice will be focused on 120 Ohio dental practices that are part of the first dental practice research network to be organized in the United States. The methodology includes a direct observation technique developed at UC Davis and utilized at CWRU for the study of Family Medical Practice. Data concerning dental practice will be gathered by two teams of dental hygienists observing dentists and hygienists in each office for 3 days. Approximately 6000 patient visits will be observed. The direct observation will utilize the Davis Observation Code, a well-tested instrument to record physician behavior, adapted to dental practice. Data also will be collected utilizing information from patient questionnaires, practitioner surveys, billing data, and qualitative reporting. Comparison of information gathered by different methods will indicate the least expensive accurate methods for collecting various kinds of information about dental practice. Hypotheses will be tested concerning the association of preventive service delivery with risk for oral disease, delivery of esthetic services, dentists' beliefs about the importance of tobacco counseling, the socioeconomic status of patients, and the ethnicity of the dentist. This first large scale study utilizing a dental practice research network will provide statistically significant data concerning factors that influence provision of preventive services (counseling and procedures) to patients in actual practice settings.         ",Observed Factors Affecting Prevention in Dental Practice,7222534,R01DE015171,"['dental health service ', ' dental personnel ', ' preventive dentistry ', ' health care quality ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' human subject ', ' dental survey ', ' African American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDCR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,108141,0.1281730752001005
"Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health A Center Addressing Disparities in Children's Oral Health is proposed at the University of California, San Francisco, with two primary institutional partners serving minority populations, the San Francisco Department of Public Health and the San Ysidro Community Health Center, a model health center located near the US-Mexican border, and additional collaborating institutions. The theme for this Center is to understand, prevent, and reduce oral health disparities among young children, with a primary focus on preventing early childhood caries. A secondary theme is to understand the interactions between the oral health and medical delivery systems that can affect children's oral health. These goals will be pursued from two primary directions: retrospective data- based projects to increase our understanding of the etiology of oral health disparities and to identify children most susceptible, and intervention projects to prevent disease. In this center we will 1) Support primarily patient and population-oriented research related to reducing oral health disparities in children; 2) Establish core facilities to provide technical services and resources to Center-affiliated projects; 3) Provide an enriched environment for training future health-care professionals and scientists, especially those from under-represented groups; 4) Establish mechanisms to increase collaboration among investigators in Center- supported projects, across health professions and affiliated collaborating public and private institutions on the west coast. Findings from this project will 1) identify cultural, environmental, workforce, behavioral, and biologic factors associated with health disparities among the ethnic/racial groups in the very diverse California environment; 2) enhance our ability to target children likely to be at risk for dental caries; 3) provide successful interdisciplinary interventions to prevent disease and reduce oral health disparities.

"Access/Utilization of Dental Care by Homeless Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Homelessness in the United States has significantly increased with female-headed homeless families (FHHF) representing the fastest growing group of homeless people. The Surgeon General's report, Oral Health in America, declared dental caries the ""silent epidemic,"" with the worst oral health found among the poor of all ages. This prospective repeated measures study will identify predictors of oral health access, utilization of needed oral health services, and oral health status for homeless children, and determine whether shelter-based care increases utilization in FHHF. A convenience sample of 100 mother/child dyads will be recruited from a homeless shelter for the regression analysis. Predictor factors, based on the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, being measured upon enrollment are: age, oral health beliefs, ethnicity, education, family size, number of times homeless, victimization, substance abuse, mental health concerns, initial oral health status, and insurance status. The mother/child dyad will be followed up one month later and outcomes will be measured. The proposed study will also describe and measure upon enrollment the level of health and oral health status of homeless children residing at a shelter. The results of the study will identify significant predictors of oral health access/utilization and oral health status in homeless children guiding nursing strategies in shelters to reduce health disparities among underserved populations.

"Enhancing Oral Health Care Use by HIV-Positives DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent national studies demonstrate that oral health care is one of the highest unmet health care needs for HIV-positive (HIV+) individuals, although it is recognized as playing a critical role in the medical management of HIV/AIDS. Social and economic factors have contributed to less than optimal use of oral health services for HIV+s in the United States. According to recent data, from Miami-Dade County, Florida, only 24% of HIV+s served by Ryan White-funded medical clinics had obtained oral health services in the past 12 months.  To address the underutilization of oral health care services, we propose to develop, implement, and evaluate an intervention to assist low-income HIV+s in obtaining access to oral health services as well as increase appropriate utilization of these services. The intervention is a brief, client-centered case management intervention. The case management intervention is adapted from an intervention that has been previously tested in a CDC-funded, multi-site study designed to link recently diagnosed HIV+s to primary medical care.  A two-arm randomized trial among HIV+ individuals who are currently enrolled in HIV primary medical care, but not receiving oral health care, will be conducted to test the intervention. The two arms will consist of a case management intervention and standard-of-care. Participants will be assessed at baseline, and at 9 and 18 months after baseline, to document their utilization of oral health services. An interdisciplinary team of behavioral and clinical research scientists with experience in developing and evaluating health care and prevention interventions targeting low income, HIV+s will conduct this research.

"Child, Family, and Community Influences on Oral Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this application is to conceptually and empirically describe risk indicators for children's oral health outcomes using a new large scale national survey of children (ages 2-18) conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and merged with other supplementary databases. Our purpose is consistent with the one described in PAR-04-091; we will be conducting secondary data analysis of parent reported oral health data using an existing database, and studying individual, family and community-level factors that have not been studied together previously using population-based data. The two specific aims of this project are to develop: 1) a conceptual model of the child level, family level and community level influences on children's oral health and 2) a set of empirical analyses designed to describe, via statistical associations, the characteristics of children at the greatest risk of developing oral health problems, thus furthering our understanding of oral health disparities. Accomplishing these specific aims will provide helpful information for dental care practitioners, families, federal and state health  policymakers, and dental health services researchers about child, family and community level influences on oral health and oral health disparities. The analyses will also provide new information on the extent to which oral health disparities exist by race/ethnicity and by income. The empirical analyses will use the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health, a new population-based survey of approximately 102,000 children nationwide, including independent samples of approximately 2,000 children in each state and the District of Columbia.

"Development of an Oral Health Literacy Instrument    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early childhood caries (ECC) is a major health problem that has a disproportionate effect on minority and disadvantaged children. An underlying contributor to this problem is parental behaviors that appear to be inconsistent with good oral health literacy. The purpose of this study is to begin the process of developing and evaluating an oral health literacy instrument that can be used by primary medical care and oral health care providers to assess the degree to which parents/guardians have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic oral health information and services needed to make appropriate decisions that have a direct impact on the oral health of their preschool children. The development of an initial version of the oral health literacy assessment instrument will be in three phases. Phase I will consist of defining the construct of oral health literacy via a Delphi process conducted with 8-10 identified oral health experts. Phase II will consist of constructing a draft assessment instrument. Phase III will employ in-depth cognitive interviewing of 8-10 parents/guardians from each of four socio-culturally distinct population groups (African American, Appalachian, Hispanic/Latino, and white, non-Appalachian, non-Hispanic/Latino) to identify potential problems that might lead to survey response error. The instrument will then be pilot-tested in two pediatric safety-net facilities that have implemented a program of oral health screening and fluoride varnish application for preschool children. Approximately 300 parents/guardians of children 0-5 years of age who provide informed consent will be asked to complete the oral health literacy assessment instrument and four additional brief surveys. Data from these surveys as well as data collected on the oral health status of children as part of the oral health screening/fluoride varnish program will be used in various psychometric analyses to assess the reliability and validity of the instrument.         ",Development of an Oral Health Literacy Instrument,7110275,R03DE017089,"['pediatrics ', ' infant human (0-1 year) ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' dental caries ', ' topical fluoride therapy ', ' oral health ', ' preventive dentistry ', ' mass screening ', ' parent ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' dental survey ', ' health behavior ', ' decision making ', ' psychometrics ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,R03,2006,74946,0.21923574414541838
"Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health A Center Addressing Disparities in Children's Oral Health is proposed at the University of California, San Francisco, with two primary institutional partners serving minority populations, the San Francisco Department of Public Health and the San Ysidro Community Health Center, a model health center located near the US-Mexican border, and additional collaborating institutions. The theme for this Center is to understand, prevent, and reduce oral health disparities among young children, with a primary focus on preventing early childhood caries. A secondary theme is to understand the interactions between the oral health and medical delivery systems that can affect children's oral health. These goals will be pursued from two primary directions: retrospective data- based projects to increase our understanding of the etiology of oral health disparities and to identify children most susceptible, and intervention projects to prevent disease. In this center we will 1) Support primarily patient and population-oriented research related to reducing oral health disparities in children; 2) Establish core facilities to provide technical services and resources to Center-affiliated projects; 3) Provide an enriched environment for training future health-care professionals and scientists, especially those from under-represented groups; 4) Establish mechanisms to increase collaboration among investigators in Center- supported projects, across health professions and affiliated collaborating public and private institutions on the west coast. Findings from this project will 1) identify cultural, environmental, workforce, behavioral, and biologic factors associated with health disparities among the ethnic/racial groups in the very diverse California environment; 2) enhance our ability to target children likely to be at risk for dental caries; 3) provide successful interdisciplinary interventions to prevent disease and reduce oral health disparities.

"Oral Health and Quality of Life in Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health stressed the significance of understanding how to bring oral health care to those segments of the US population that need it most, but are underserved. Children from socio economically disadvantaged backgrounds are one of these groups. Gaining a clearer understanding of how to improve their situation is the overall objective of this proposal. The concrete aims are (a) to validate the self report version and the parent/guardian (proxy) version of the Michigan Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (MOHRQOL) Scale for children (Aim 1), (b) to design and validate a short screening version of this instrument that parents/guardians and teachers can use to identify children in need for oral health care (Aim 2), (c) to identify the factors that ultimately determine parents'/guardians' decisions to seek oral health care for a child (Aim 3), and (d) to develop and evaluate educational material for parents/guardians and teachers/school administrators to alert them to the importance of regular preventive oral health care for elementary school age children as well as how to obtain reparative care once a child in need is identified (Aim 4). In order to investigate these aims, a research project is proposed that collects data from elementary school children, their parents/guardians, and teachers. In Study 1, survey data will be collected (a) from elementary school age children from underprivileged backgrounds about their ohrqol (N=3,000), and (b) from their parents/guardians (N=400) about their child's oral health, oral health care needs, and oral health-related quality of life. The children's oral health will be determined in oral exams. This study is used to validate the MOHRQOL - child and parent (proxy) versions (Aim 1), and to do a test-item analysis to identify the items that can be used in a screening instrument for parents and teachers. In Study 2, teachers (N=300) will be surveyed to assess their awareness of how oral health problems might interfere with learning, and whether they can identify when this is the case. In Year 2, the screening versions of the MOHRQOL for parents / guardians and teachers will be validated (Aim 2) by conducting Study 3. This study collects oral health data from children (N=3,000), as well as data collected with the screening instrument from children, parents/guardians (N=400), and teachers (N=300). Study 4 is designed as a focus group study with parents/guardians and teachers. Its goal is to identify the factors that shape parents'/guardians' decisions to seek oral health care for a child (Aim 3), and determine which informational needs parents and teachers have concerning children's oral health. Based on these findings, educational material for parents/guardians and teachers will be developed and its effectiveness will be evaluated in Study 5, a survey study of parents' (N=400) and teachers' (N=300) evaluations of the educational materials (Aim 4).         ",Oral Health and Quality of Life in Children,7072271,R01DE014887,"['middle childhood (6-11) ', ' dental disorder diagnosis ', ' oral health ', ' preventive dentistry ', ' health education ', ' parent ', ' medical outreach /case finding ', ' health care referral /consultation ', ' health care service utilization ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care cost /financing ', ' human subject ', ' information dissemination ', ' interview ', ' questionnaire ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' health survey ', ' ethnic group ', ' socioeconomics ', ' quality of life ', ' teacher ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' educational resource design /development ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' focus group ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2006,321590,0.27011598084565286
"Reducing Oral Cancer Disparities in Florida DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Florida bears a disproportionate burden from cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx: in 2000, Florida had the nation's second highest age-adjusted incidence rate for females and fifth-highest rate for males, and had the second highest number of new cases. Black/African American and white males in Florida experience comparable incidence rates, but blacks experience significantly higher mortality rates and lower survival rates, suggesting that earlier detection may help reduce racial disparities in prognosis. This project seeks to promote oral cancer awareness and early detection among blacks/African Americans in Florida through the following Specific Aims: (1) Use a social marketing approach to develop a mass-media campaign on oral and pharyngeal cancer for a population at high risk for incidence and mortality; (2) Increase the proportion of the target population that knows the major risk factors, signs, and symptoms of oral and pharyngeal cancer; and (3) Increase the proportion of the target population that receives a clinical examination for oral and pharyngeal cancer. Using a theory-based social marketing approach guided by preliminary study findings, this project will develop culturally-appropriate, research-based educational messages and materials. The project will use two approaches to increase oral cancer awareness, knowledge, and preventive behaviors among black/African American adults in northeast Florida: 1) a wide-scale mass media approach centered in Duval County but reaching all surrounding counties; and 2) a targeted, faith-based effort among a network of primarily African American churches in medically and dentally underserved areas in northeast Florida. A toll free telephone hotline will be available to provide additional information and links to clinical facilities for exams. County health departments in northeast Florida will provide oral cancer examinations at their facilities, and onsite examinations will be provided by dentists at participating churches. Effectiveness of the interventions will be measured through population-based surveys and utilization of the hotline and clinics.

"Molecular Analysis of the Biofilm in Caries and Health DESCRIPTION: Dental caries is the most common chronic disease of childhood, and is the biggest unmet health care need among America's children. Socioeconomic disparities in both rates of disease and treatment are a major public health issue. To date, effective biological interventions to prevent caries have not been developed. Dental plaque contains several hundred different organisms, many of which are poorly studied. A number of species have been shown to produce sufficient acid to drive pH below critical levels and to tolerate low pH. Research has primarily focused on Streptococcus mutans as the etiologic agent in caries, but based the work of previous investigators using cultivation and on our preliminary findings using molecular methods, S. mutans is not always present in caries, is often found at low levels, and additional and unexpected bacterial species may be important. In addition, comparatively little attention has been paid to identifying health-associated and potentially beneficial bacterial species that may reside in the oral cavity. For the proposed project, bacterial species present in childhood caries and health will be identified by cloning and sequencing bacterial 16S ribosomal genes amplified from DNA isolated from plaque samples. This open ended approach will allow the detection and identification of all bacterial species present, including novel, uncultivated or unexpected species. The presence and quantities of the species identified by this approach as potentially associated with caries or health will then be determined using quantitative, real-time PCR. This dual-technique approach will allow the examination of a much larger sample size than is possible by cloning and sequencing alone. Accomplishment of the proposed studies will identify the pathogens associated with the onset and progression of severe caries of the primary and young permanent dentition, and identify those bacterial species associated with a healthy dentition. This study will also provide a comprehensive catalog of the supragingival flora in children based on molecular technology. The significance of the proposed work is that identification of additional caries pathogens would provide alternative targets for biological interventions, and identification of beneficial health-associated species could provide the basis for therapeutic interventions to establish caries-resistant microbial communities.

"Oral Health Outcomes of Early Childhood Malnutrition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objectives of this retrospective cohort study are to assess the impact of early protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) on the permanent dentition, specifically with respect to: 1) dental caries, 2) enamel hypoplasia, 3) tooth eruption timing, and 4) salivary function. The proposed investigation will seek to assess clear dose-response and temporal relationships between early childhood PEM (ages birth-5 years old) and these oral outcomes at ages 10-18 years. An explanatory model of enamel hypoplasia, salivary gland hypofunction, tooth eruption timing, and socioeconomic risk factors as possible mechanisms for caries following PEM exposure will be examined. The few existing published human studies of PEM and oral outcomes were typically of cross-sectional design, with limited control for confounding variables, and almost exclusively focused on the primary dentition. Until now, there has been no high quality data base of past PEM exposure with a sufficient lag period of 10 years or more to allow the study of early childhood malnutrition effects on the permanent dentition. This study will capitalize on a 'natural experiment situation' that has occurred in Haiti, i.e. a database of serial weightings of children in their first 5 years of life, who had experienced the full range of PEM, and will maximize the time since exposure for disease determination. PEM exposure will be assessed using weights included in an ongoing Haitian Health Foundation database maintained since 1988 on over 16,000 children. The completion of this natural experiment only requires the collection of the oral health data from a randomly selected sub-group of these 16,000 children, stratified by nutrition status according to the severity and chronicity of their exposure to PEM. A random sample of 10-18 year old children frequency matched for age and gender will be recruited from each PEM stratum, for a total sample of 1,250 children. The investigation will consist of a four-month-long field dental examination, saliva collection and interview survey by a calibrated team of U.S. and Haitian trained dentists and epidemiologists. The primary analyses will consist of regression models that will assess the associations between the four oral outcomes and PEM levels and socioeconomic factors, as well as determining age-specific critical PEM exposure(s). The findings of this study will provide the first scientific evidence regarding the potential effect of early childhood PEM on the complete permanent dentition based on a retrospective longitudinal cohort study. Given the universality of PEM pathophysiology, this study's findings will be generalizable to subsets of U.S. children having 9 oral health disparities.         ",Oral Health Outcomes of Early Childhood Malnutrition,7067599,R01DE014708,"['bioenergetics ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' middle childhood (6-11) ', ' dental caries ', ' oral health ', ' dentition ', ' tooth enamel ', ' dentistry ', ' pathologic process ', ' human subject ', ' questionnaire ', ' malnutrition ', ' protein deficiency ', ' salivary gland ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' early experience ', ' socioeconomics ', ' clinical research ', ' outcomes research ', ' ']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,438350,0.27129748342356486

"Northwest/Alaska Cent. to Reduce Oral Health Disparities This proposal is in response to RFD DE-99-003 to establish the Northwest and Alaska Center for Oral Health Disparity for research to reduce oral health disparities in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska.  It is proposed that the Center develop basic and applied knowledge that addresses the needs of poor, minority, and rural children and their caretakers, utilizing approaches that go beyond the traditional strategies from dental public health that have not found success in these populations. While the research in the proposed center may involve traditional dental personnel, it also stresses the roles of pediatricians, mothers as well as children; and preventive agents beyond fluorides. Participants include Alaska Natives, Native Americans from the Yakima Indian Nation, Hispanics from the agricultural areas of Washington, African Americans and Hispanics from the local military reservations, Hispanics and Pacific Islanders served by urban hospitals as well as rural and low-income Whites. We propose to accomplish this goal through five specific aims: (1) To address the needs of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska by conducting clinical research to evaluate the efficacy of non- traditional interventions to prevent and treat oral disease in children and their caretakers; (2) To develop community-based research that translates existing knowledge and new information regarding children and their caretakers into new technologies and interventions that hold promise for reducing disparities in these high risk populations; (3) To expand health science education and research training opportunities for minority populations in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska by collaborations with key minority educational and health serving institutions in the region; (4) To conduct basic research to further understand the role of host defenses and genetic bases for caries and periodontal disease affect underserved populations as well as to probe the biologic basis for antibacterial that change disease susceptibility; and (5) To increase the impact of the center beyond the projects included in this proposal by recruiting investigators and students from minority institutions in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska and prioritizing and encouraging pilot and center-affiliated studies in which they are involved. The collaborating institutions and partners are Heritage College (Hispanic and Native American-serving institution sited on the Yakima Indian Nation), Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium/Yukon-Kuskokwim Native Health Corporation, Yakima Valley Farm Workers Clinic, Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board/Northwest Tribal Epidemiology Center, Washington Dental Service an Foundation (major private dental insurer); and Medical Assistance Administration (Medicaid agency for Washington State).

"Oral Microbiology Studies in Appalachia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children living in Appalachia rank lowest in the U.S. on indicators of oral health status. The substandard quality of oral health is consistent with well-documented findings that poor (and minority) children account for the majority of dental decay. We are applying a multidisciplinary approach to investigating factors contributing to this disparity. This application is a request for supplemental funding to extend the scope of our currently funded Genetics and Psychosocial Projects by addressing the microbiological contribution to poor oral health, particularly caries, in the same Appalachian sample. We will investigate the overall composition of oral flora in the total study population (1500 individuals in 250 families), and then intensely study Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) in a subset of 50 people from the highest- and lowest-risk families. S. mutans is considered to be a principal or the principal cause of dental caries. S. mutans is quite diverse at the genetic level; multiple genotypes are isolated from children and their parents, and from young adults. More strains are isolated from those with caries (~5) than those without caries (~3). The overall goal of this study is to compare the genetic diversity and virulence characteristics of S. mutans strains from high caries and low caries families in order to gain insight into the extent that poor oral health can be attributed to host factors versus S. mutans characteristics. In addition, we will develop high throughput methods for genotyping and screening S. mutans that can be applied in future, larger studies. We will compare the genetic diversity and virulence characteristics of S. mutans isolated from the tongue, saliva and supra-gingival plaque of individuals from 5-6 high caries families to those from 5-6 low caries families, approximately 1000 isolates each from 50 individuals. We will use various laboratory techniques to do so, including arbitrarily primed PCR, PCR, and dot blot hybridization. The techniques will also allow us to determine the extent that S. mutans are shared between individuals within a family or community, and the extent that the strains vary over time. Study results will guide the development of more effective caries prevention strategies.      LAY SUMMARY: Factors such as using fluoride products and toothbrushing decrease rates of dental decay, but some people who do so still have high rates of dental cavities. One cause of dental decay is bacteria found in the mouth, especially Streptococcus mutans. In this study we will compare the characteristics of S. mutans found in the mouth of families with high rates of dental cavities to that found in the mouth of those with low rates of dental cavities. This will help us understand how much of the differences in dental health is due to the S. mutans and to other factors.          ",Oral Microbiology Studies in Appalachia,7147086,R01DE014899,[''],NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2006,137260,0.278799366607701
"Detroit Center for Research on Oral Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant) - The Detroit Center for Research on Oral Health Disparities aims to promote oral health and reduce disparities within the community of low-income African American children (0-5 years) and their main caregivers (14 + years) living in the City of Detroit. The driving theme of the center's research program is to identify determinants and design interventions to answer the following question: why do some low-income African American children and their main caregivers have better oral health than others who live in the same community? The proposed center will focus on studying intra-group disparities in oral health. The community based partners, the City of Detroit Department of Health (DDH) and the Voices of Detroit Initiative (VODI) have strongly supported this theme. The Center will include 3 support cores, 5 research core projects and 1 pilot study. The Center's Methodology Core will select a multistage random sample of African American families living in the poorest 39 Census Tracts in the City of Detroit. A total of 1,529 families will be sampled and interviewed in their homes. It is estimated that 994 families will be examined at community centers in year 2 (2002) funding. Based on extensive data collected by the investigative team (R01 MH58299) in Detroit, the investigators predict that 760 families will be retained by the third examination phase in year 6 (2006). The research teams will investigate the social characteristics of parents, families, and neighborhoods, that are associated with disparities in oral health (dental caries and periodontal diseases) of children and their caregivers; lead levels in saliva of children and saliva and blood (finger prick) of the main caregivers; dietary intake; and genetic, behavioral, social and bacteriologic risk factors of periodontal disease in adults. Using information from 3 core research projects, the investigators propose to develop a tailored multi-media educational intervention (Project #3), based on the transtheoretical model of behavioral change, which will be administered using a randomized controlled design in year 4 of funding, just prior to the second examination phase. Additionally, the center will evaluate the impact on access to dental care of the state-funded experiment on utilization where Medicaid children are managed like privately insured patients (Project #4). The center will support health professionals from the DDH and VODI and the University of Detroit Mercy to receive research training. Doctoral students in three programs targeting minorities in the Schools of Public health and Social Work will be offered stipends to conduct research on health disparities. All families will have access to dental care in a DDH dental clinic (funded by DDH, HRSA, Delta Dental of Michigan and VODI).

"Oral health disparities in the first 4 decades of life DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective: The proposed research aims to use a life-course approach to develop a better understanding of the interplay of biological, environmental and behavioral determinants and antecedents of oral conditions from childhood to oral health by elucidating the nature, scale, persistence and potential mutability of oral health disparities in a population-based cohort of adults.      Methods: The Dunedin Study has traced the development of a representative 1972 birth cohort of 1,000 New Zealand men and women at birth and ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21 and 26. New data will be gathered at age 31, enabling analysis of oral health disparities data from childhood to age 31. The research will: (1) document the natural history of oral conditions through to the 4th decade of life; (2) examine the influence of earlier SES (and SES transitions) on adult oral health; (3) using periodontal disease as a model, test hypotheses about gene-environment interactions in the origins of poor adult oral health; and (4) determine the extent to which poor oral health is an important contributor to (a) poor physical health and (b) experience of adverse life outcomes by the 4th decade of life. The planned research will provide unique information on the scale, persistence and potential mutability of disparities in oral health through the first four decades of life, and will assist in identifying those clinical, public health and policy interventions, which are likely to be most appropriate and efficacious in reducing oral health disparities. The Dunedin Study offers a unique opportunity to conduct such an investigation because of the comprehensive data archive, which has already been assembled.      Implications: The persistence of oral health disparities has not been investigated through the entire life course to date, and close examination of the degree to which the Dunedin cohort's early-life disparities in oral health persist into adulthood would be invaluable in determining whether (and to what extent) such inequalities can be reduced by clinical, public health or policy interventions. The outcome of this important work will inform and determine the nature of measures which are taken to reduce oral health disparities.

"Rural Older Adults: Oral Health, Diet & Quality of Life DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral health is central to physical and psychosocial well-being. Oral health deficits affect nutritional status through constraining dietary choices, and they can impair social interaction and integration due to pain, communication disorders, and embarrassment. While advances in preventive dentistry over the past half century have been dramatic, disparities in oral health continue to exist. Older rural adults are a particularly high risk population for oral health disparities; many have had limited access to oral health care services, high poverty rates and low socioeconomic status which place them at risk for oral health deficits relative to their urban and suburban counterparts. The high proportion of ethnic minorities among rural elders in some parts of the US makes disparities in oral health status within rural populations likely. This competing continuation application (R01 AG13469), which builds on eight years of community-based research on nutritional self-management and nutritional status in two rural, multi-ethnic North Carolina counties, has the overall goal of documenting the impact of oral health on multiple domains of life for rural adults > 60 years by accomplishing four specific aims: (1) to document the oral health status of older rural adults in a multi-ethnic population, and its association with gender, ethnicity, and other demographic predictors; (2) to delineate the nutritional impact of deficits in oral health, including food selection, food preparation, food consumption, nutrient intake, and nutritional status; (3) to document the relationship of oral health to social functioning, including communication and social interaction; and (4) to assess the impact of oral health on perceived well-being/quality of life (QoL, directly and as mediated by dietary intake and social functioning. Building on a foundation of community ethnography begun in 1996, this project will achieve its specific aims using a multi-method approach that integrates the results of qualitative research with older adults (in-depth interviews with 36 older adults experiencing oral health deficits) with a cross-sectional random epidemiological survey (n=750) and clinical examination (dentate only, n=450) of oral health and its consequences for nutritional status and quality of life among a tri-ethnic (African American, Native American and white) largely disadvantaged population of older adults.

"Effects of Immigration on Oral Health: A Comparative Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ethnic minorities (native born, immigrant and refugees) in the US and in other industrialized countries have a much higher prevalence of oral disease compared to the majority population. The foreign-born population in New York City (NYC) increased from 2.1 million in 1990 to 2.9 million in 2000, a new peak. The assessment of the determinants of the oral health status of the immigrants in NYC and in the US in general is vital to plan effective oral health promotion programs and to eliminate disparities in oral health. This study will be the first assessment, that we are aware of, of the effect of immigrant status on multiple clinical indicators of oral health, perceptions of health and other predictors of oral health across specific subgroups of Asian, Hispanic/Latino and West Indian adult populations in the US. The proposed study will utilize data collected from one of the four major studies of the Northeastern Regional Center for Minority Oral Health. We propose to expand the scope of the original study by analyzing data from the top six racial/ethnic immigrant groups in NYC (Chinese, Asian Indian, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Central/-South Americans, and West Indians) with a new focus and analytical techniques. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) examine and compare the association between immigrant status (country of birth, age at immigration and years in the US) and the oral health status (documented caries and periodontal disease) of the top six adult racial/ethnic subgroups in New York City; 2) examine and compare the correlates of utilization of oral health care services across six adult racial/ethnic subgroups in New York City; 3) examine and compare the predictors of self-perceived oral health across six adult racial/ethnic subgroups in New York City. The proposed study would help elucidate the effects of ethnicity on the oral health of immigrants by examining some of the underlying factors associated with disparities in oral health.          ",Effects of Immigration on Oral Health: A Comparative Study,7103756,R03DE016864,"['oral health ', ' human migration ', ' Asian ', ' urban area ', ' immigrant ', ' clinical research ', ' ']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R03,2006,153567,0.28617564746076174
"Detroit Oral Cancer Prevention Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Detroit Oral Cancer Prevention Project is designed based on the extensive epidemiological analysis of the incidence, mortality, and early detection rates in Michigan (MI) during the last decade. African-American (AA) males in Detroit/Wayne County have the highest incidence and mortality rates in MI. The oral cancer survival rates of AA in Detroit have not changed significantly during the last 30 years; and smoking and alcohol use are relatively higher than the national average. Our analysis of data obtained from healthcare providers in community health centers show that 44% of the providers had high knowledge level on oral cancer and they identified high need for CE programs. About 70% of providers reported that they screen for oral cancer; yet there has not been a wide adoption of the one sheet screening form that was prepared specifically for these clinics by our program. A literature review identified that screening for cancers can be increased if a comprehensive media campaign and community outreach programs are implemented (Push-Pull Strategy). The aim of the Detroit Oral Cancer Prevention project is to achieve Healthy People 2010 Objectives. In Detroit (test site), a two-year media campaign will include radio and newspaper advertisements and outdoor signs that will promote early screening, tobacco cessation and reduction in drinking of alcohol. The media campaign will be coordinated with a community outreach educational program conducted in collaboration with churches and 144 local neighborhood organizations; an 800-toll free information telephone service will be available 16 hours per day for 5 days to provide information and schedule patients for free screening at a network of clinics to be available for 5 days per week. Additionally reminder postcards will be mailed to healthcare and dental providers in Detroit to emphasize the need for screening, tobacco cessation and, reduction in drinking of alcohol. In the seven comparison counties, with relatively high concentration of AA) only the reminder cards will be mailed. All healthcare and dental providers (test and comparison counties) will be offered CME or CDE courses (online and via scheduled courses) twice a year in each area. The changes in oral cancer incidence, mortality and early detection rates in Detroit and the comparison counties will be evaluated by the data collected by SEER and the Michigan Cancer Registry. Interim surveys will be conducted to evaluate the success of the program (process evaluation).

"Race/Ethnicity, Socioeconomic Status and Oral Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several studies report that that race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage are related to self-reports of general health, but very few studies have examined these relationships for self-rated oral health and other measures of perceived oral health, particularly among low-income and racially and ethnically diverse U.S. populations. The purpose of this study is to estimate composition (differences in people) and context (differences in places where people live) effects on low-income mothers' perceptions of oral health and their children's oral health. Aim 1 will estimate composition effects in a population of children aged 3-6 covered by Medicaid and their low-income mothers by: (a) describing the disparities in perceived oral health by racial/ethnic group and SES among mothers and their children, including the association between mother's perceptions of her oral health and her child's oral health in each group; (b) estimating whether a gradient relationship exists between mother's SES (income, education, and employment status) and her perceived oral health and perceptions of her child's oral health; and (c) estimating the interaction effects of SES and race/ethnicity on perceived oral health. Aim 2 addresses contextual effects: controlling for individual-level characteristics, we will estimate the independent effects of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage on the perceived oral health of mothers and their children aged 3-6. We also will test whether our findings are consistent with the general health literature by repeating Aims 1 and 2 for mother ratings of her and her child's general health. Data for this study come from our NIDCR study, Linking Mother and Child Access to Dental Care (NIDCR Grant No. R01 DE014400), a prospective cohorts udy of children aged 3-6 covered by Medicaid and their mothers in Washington state. Building on the biological connection between mother and child oral health, its main purpose is to determine whether having a me ther with a regular source of dental care at baseline is associated with greater dental care for the child af ter 1 year. Baseline survey data exist for 4,373 children and mothers in the following racial/ethnic groups: ,311 Hispanic mothers, 1,385 White mothers, 818 Black mothers, and 719 mothers from other racial/ethnic groups. Measures of perceived oral health include self- rating of oral health, fair/poor oral health, rating of condition of teeth, and number and type of dental problems. Guided by the study's conceptual model, regression equations will be estimated to test hypotheses. In Aim 1 binary and ordinal logistic regression will be used to estimate the effects of race/ethnicity and SES on mothers' perceptions of their and their children's health, controlling for other individual characteristics and risk factors. In Aim 2 mixed-effect multilevel models will be used to estimate the effects of neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage on perceived oral health controlling for individual-level characteristics.           ","Race/Ethnicity, Socioeconomic Status and Oral Health",7129714,R03DE017621,"['oral health ', ' parent ', ' clinical research ', ' children ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R03,2006,155000,0.2640658033894819
"NYU Oral Cancer RAAHP Center This proposed NYU Oral Cancer Research for Adolescent and Adult Health Promotion (RAAHP) Center is a P50 Center which was designed in response to the NIDCR request for applications for Centers for Research to Reduce Oral Health Disparities (RFA:DE-99-003). The overall goal of this proposed NY Oral Cancer RAAHP Center is to conduct studies and promote activities that will reduce oral disparities in the United States. While oral cancer occurs in all segments of the U.S. population, oral cancer rates (both incidence and mortality) are highest among minority populations, especially in African Americans and in Hispanics.

"Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health A Center Addressing Disparities in Children's Oral Health is proposed at the University of California, San Francisco, with two primary institutional partners serving minority populations, the San Francisco Department of Public Health and the San Ysidro Community Health Center, a model health center located near the US-Mexican border, and additional collaborating institutions. The theme for this Center is to understand, prevent, and reduce oral health disparities among young children, with a primary focus on preventing early childhood caries. A secondary theme is to understand the interactions between the oral health and medical delivery systems that can affect children's oral health. These goals will be pursued from two primary directions: retrospective data- based projects to increase our understanding of the etiology of oral health disparities and to identify children most susceptible, and intervention projects to prevent disease. In this center we will 1) Support primarily patient and population-oriented research related to reducing oral health disparities in children; 2) Establish core facilities to provide technical services and resources to Center-affiliated projects; 3) Provide an enriched environment for training future health-care professionals and scientists, especially those from under-represented groups; 4) Establish mechanisms to increase collaboration among investigators in Center- supported projects, across health professions and affiliated collaborating public and private institutions on the west coast. Findings from this project will 1) identify cultural, environmental, workforce, behavioral, and biologic factors associated with health disparities among the ethnic/racial groups in the very diverse California environment; 2) enhance our ability to target children likely to be at risk for dental caries; 3) provide successful interdisciplinary interventions to prevent disease and reduce oral health disparities.

"Selection Bias in Studies of Treatment Effectiveness  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application responds to the April 12, 2004 program announcement entitled ""N1DCR Small Research Grants for Data Analysis and Statistical Methodology (R03); PAR-04-091"". The Florida Dental Care Study (FDCS) is a prospective observational study of oral health and dental care based on a diverse, population-based sample including many subjects at increased risk for oral health disparities (e.g., African Americans, persons of low socioeconomic status, and persons whose approach to dental care is problem-oriented, rather than based on regular attendance). FDCS is the first study to use an innovative approach that directly links clinical exam data, self-reported dimensions of oral health, use of specific dental services, and diverse patient characteristics in a population-based sample of subjects who may or may not be regular attendees at dental clinics. This data set, which includes longitudinal observations across 72 months of follow-up, provides a unique database that is unprecedented in adult oral health disparities research, oral epidemiology, and dental health services research. So far, important hypotheses about the relationship between dental disease measured clinically, self-reported dimensions of oral health, health-related quality of life, and use of dental care have been tested. While the randomized trial has traditionally been considered the gold standard study design for evaluation of medical treatment effects, observational trials have important strengths. Observational studies allow evaluation of the effects of treatments for which randomized assignment is impossible, such as those for which subjects self-select into treatment groups, or for which a representative sample of the population of interest is not attainable. However, because subjects are not randomly assigned to receive treatment or not, observed group effects are likely to be confounded by characteristics, observed or not observed, other than the group difference that is of interest. This confounding leads to a potential for biased estimation of treatment differences, known as sample selection bias. The goals of this 2-year project are (1) to quantify the effects of sample selection bias on conclusions made about the effectiveness of specific types of dental services, using a broad range of oral health outcomes and treatment types, and (2) to measure whether these effects of selection bias in Specific Aim 1 differ by race, socioeconomic status, or typical approach to dental care (regular versus problem-oriented attendance).              ",Selection Bias in Studies of Treatment Effectiveness,7103710,R03DE016947,"['oral health ', ' dental health service ', ' dentistry ', ' preventive dentistry ', ' human subject ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' epidemiology ', ' bias ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R03,2006,142081,0.276633301380714
"Observed Factors Affecting Prevention in Dental Practice    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identification of mutable factors associated with the delivery of preventive services by dentists in general practice is the subject of this study. Identification of such factors will lead to the design, implementation, and evaluation of interventions that will improve preventive services provided in general dental practice. The conceptual framework for factor identification is that provided by Andersen in the Behavioral Model of Health Services Use. This study of dental practice will be focused on 120 Ohio dental practices that are part of the first dental practice research network to be organized in the United States. The methodology includes a direct observation technique developed at UC Davis and utilized at CWRU for the study of Family Medical Practice. Data concerning dental practice will be gathered by two teams of dental hygienists observing dentists and hygienists in each office for 3 days. Approximately 6000 patient visits will be observed. The direct observation will utilize the Davis Observation Code, a well-tested instrument to record physician behavior, adapted to dental practice. Data also will be collected utilizing information from patient questionnaires, practitioner surveys, billing data, and qualitative reporting. Comparison of information gathered by different methods will indicate the least expensive accurate methods for collecting various kinds of information about dental practice. Hypotheses will be tested concerning the association of preventive service delivery with risk for oral disease, delivery of esthetic services, dentists' beliefs about the importance of tobacco counseling, the socioeconomic status of patients, and the ethnicity of the dentist. This first large scale study utilizing a dental practice research network will provide statistically significant data concerning factors that influence provision of preventive services (counseling and procedures) to patients in actual practice settings.         ",Observed Factors Affecting Prevention in Dental Practice,6994460,R01DE015171,"['dental health service ', ' dental personnel ', ' preventive dentistry ', ' health care quality ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' human subject ', ' dental survey ', ' African American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDCR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,481214,0.1281730752001005
"Oral Health Disparities Among High-Risk Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award for Monica Fisher, DDS, MS, MPH, PhD. This award would allow Dr. Fisher to meet her long-term career goal to conduct productive and innovative patient-oriented research that focuses on oral health disparities and treatment effectiveness among high-risk populations. An immediate career goal is to gain additional expertise relevant to research on oral health disparities among high-risk populations.      We propose 3 aims related to career development and 4 related to the research plan. Dr. Fisher's career development aims are to: (1) obtain advanced biostatistical training; (2) increase analytical expertise in the areas of treatment effectiveness and smoking as a major risk factor for oral disease and its systemic effects; and (3) use these findings as preliminary data for subsequent R03 and R01 grant applications. The Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health highlights the imperative for rigorous studies on oral health disparities in high-risk populations, studies on smoking as a major risk factor, and studies on linkages between oral and general health. Therefore, the research plan comprises investigations of oral health disparities among high-risk populations (data from the Florida Dental Care Study) and persons with systemic conditions (data from the third National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey). The specific aims of the research plan are to test hypotheses that among highrisk populations: (4) dental care is effective in facilitating recovery and preventing oral health-related quality of life decrements, but varies by race and socioeconomic status (SES); (5) dental care is effective in facilitating recovery and preventing oral diseases, but varies by race and SES; (6) periodontal disease is associated with heart disease and glycemic control in diabetics, in analyses restricted to non-smokers; (7) self-reported need for a dental cleaning is associated with heart disease and glycemic control in diabetics, in analyses restricted to non-smokers.  This activity will take place in highly supportive research environments. Co-mentors Gregg Gilbert, DDS, MBA, Mark Litaker, PhD, and George Taylor, DMD, DrPH, national experts in their fields, will supervise Dr. Fisher's research and career development.

"Detroit Center for Research on Oral Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant) - The Detroit Center for Research on Oral Health Disparities aims to promote oral health and reduce disparities within the community of low-income African American children (0-5 years) and their main caregivers (14 + years) living in the City of Detroit. The driving theme of the center's research program is to identify determinants and design interventions to answer the following question: why do some low-income African American children and their main caregivers have better oral health than others who live in the same community? The proposed center will focus on studying intra-group disparities in oral health. The community based partners, the City of Detroit Department of Health (DDH) and the Voices of Detroit Initiative (VODI) have strongly supported this theme. The Center will include 3 support cores, 5 research core projects and 1 pilot study. The Center's Methodology Core will select a multistage random sample of African American families living in the poorest 39 Census Tracts in the City of Detroit. A total of 1,529 families will be sampled and interviewed in their homes. It is estimated that 994 families will be examined at community centers in year 2 (2002) funding. Based on extensive data collected by the investigative team (R01 MH58299) in Detroit, the investigators predict that 760 families will be retained by the third examination phase in year 6 (2006).

"Effects of Immigration on Oral Health: A Comparative Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ethnic minorities (native born, immigrant and refugees) in the US and in other industrialized countries have a much higher prevalence of oral disease compared to the majority population. The foreign-born population in New York City (NYC) increased from 2.1 million in 1990 to 2.9 million in 2000, a new peak. The assessment of the determinants of the oral health status of the immigrants in NYC and in the US in general is vital to plan effective oral health promotion programs and to eliminate disparities in oral health. This study will be the first assessment, that we are aware of, of the effect of immigrant status on multiple clinical indicators of oral health, perceptions of health and other predictors of oral health across specific subgroups of Asian, Hispanic/Latino and West Indian adult populations in the US. The proposed study will utilize data collected from one of the four major studies of the Northeastern Regional Center for Minority Oral Health. We propose to expand the scope of the original study by analyzing data from the top six racial/ethnic immigrant groups in NYC (Chinese, Asian Indian, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Central/-South Americans, and West Indians) with a new focus and analytical techniques. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) examine and compare the association between immigrant status (country of birth, age at immigration and years in the US) and the oral health status (documented caries and periodontal disease) of the top six adult racial/ethnic subgroups in New York City; 2) examine and compare the correlates of utilization of oral health care services across six adult racial/ethnic subgroups in New York City; 3) examine and compare the predictors of self-perceived oral health across six adult racial/ethnic subgroups in New York City. The proposed study would help elucidate the effects of ethnicity on the oral health of immigrants by examining some of the underlying factors associated with disparities in oral health.          ",Effects of Immigration on Oral Health: A Comparative Study,7247948,R03DE016864,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Dominican Republic ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Dominican ', ' Caribbean natives ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Subgroup ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Rate ', ' Asian Indian ', ' Hindu ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Clinical ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Numbers ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Americas ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Persons ', ' Nationalities ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' New York City ', ' Immigrant ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Nation ', ' Developed Country ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Perception ', ' Periodontal Diseases ', ' periodontium disorder ', ' periodontium disease ', ' periodontal disorder ', ' Parodontosis ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Refugees ', ' Research ', ' Societies ', ' programs ', ' South America ', ' Asian Americans ', ' United States ', ' South American ', ' Oral ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Birth Rate ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' craniofacial ', ' craniofacies ', ' experience ', ' Reporting ', ' Today ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Native-Born ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R03,2007,151508,0.28617564746076174
"MEASURING & DOCUMENTING DISPARITIES IN ORAL HEALTH: A PRACTICAL APPROACH    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While some improvements in the health of the United States (US) population have occurred over time, the persistence of disparities between groups, namely racial/ethnic or socioeconomic groups, indicates that such improvement has been uneven. Although these disparities have been documented over the years and some studies have attempted to examine trends over time, it has been challenging to estimate the magnitude and direction of these disparities across groups due to the lack of a uniform or standard methodology to measure health disparities and their trends across time. Oral health disparities are not an exception to this challenge. The goal of this proposal is to develop and test a methodology to assess oral health disparities in dental caries and periodontal diseases across populations over time. In order to accomplish this goal, we propose the following two specific aims: Aim 1: Use data from NHANES III to develop sensitive methods to measure disparities in dental caries and periodontal disease in the US population accounting for the difference in case definitions across studies. These methods will be developed considering and accounting for: a) the distribution of disease in the population by age, gender, race/ethnicity and socioeconomic position (SEP) indicators; b) the selection of the best reference group; and c) the comparison of results obtained using relative versus absolute measures of disease. Aim 2: Use data from NHANES 1999-2002 to test the measures developed in Aim 1 to assess oral health disparities in dental caries and periodontal disease. Testing the validity and reliability of the developed methodology in Aim 1 using the NHANES 1999-2002 data will allow us to provide guidelines and recommendations for the use of uniform and standardized measures to document the existing oral health disparities in studies at the local and national levels across groups of the population over time. This proposal's aims are consistent with the NIDCR Strategic Plan's Crosscutting Areas-Health Disparities and Data acquisition and Analysis-and the Healthy People 2010's goal of eliminating health disparities among segment of the US population. Specifically, accomplishing this proposed study's aims has the potential to contribute to our understanding of oral health disparities in the US; to provide the tools to gauge the magnitude and direction of oral health disparities using uniform measures in studies at the local and national levels; and to recommend guidelines for oral health disparity comparisons across studies and populations over time. Finally, the developed measures have the potential to be used to measure health disparities related to age, gender, race/ethnicity and socioeconomic position on other oral health outcomes and health outcomes in general.           ",MEASURING & DOCUMENTING DISPARITIES IN ORAL HEALTH: A PRACTICAL APPROACH,7303137,R03DE017901,"['Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Population Group ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' trend ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Guidelines ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Periodontal Diseases ', ' periodontium disorder ', ' periodontium disease ', ' periodontal disorder ', ' Parodontosis ', ' Periodontal Index ', ' tool ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Accounting ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' data acquisition ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NIDCR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2007,1,0.347657726008887
"Northwest/Alaska Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparity This proposal is in response to RFD DE-99-003 to establish the Northwest and Alaska Center for Oral Health Disparity for research to reduce oral health disparities in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska.  It is proposed that the Center develop basic and applied knowledge that addresses the needs of poor, minority, and rural children and their caretakers, utilizing approaches that go beyond the traditional strategies from dental public health that have not found success in these populations. While the research in the proposed center may involve traditional dental personnel, it also stresses the roles of pediatricians, mothers as well as children; and preventive agents beyond fluorides. Participants include Alaska Natives, Native Americans from the Yakima Indian Nation, Hispanics from the agricultural areas of Washington, African Americans and Hispanics from the local military reservations, Hispanics and Pacific Islanders served by urban hospitals as well as rural and low-income Whites. We propose to accomplish this goal through five specific aims: (1) To address the needs of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska by conducting clinical research to evaluate the efficacy of non- traditional interventions to prevent and treat oral disease in children and their caretakers; (2) To develop community-based research that translates existing knowledge and new information regarding children and their caretakers into new technologies and interventions that hold promise for reducing disparities in these high risk populations; (3) To expand health science education and research training opportunities for minority populations in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska by collaborations with key minority educational and health serving institutions in the region; (4) To conduct basic research to further understand the role of host defenses and genetic bases for caries and periodontal disease affect underserved populations as well as to probe the biologic basis for antibacterial that change disease susceptibility; and (5) To increase the impact of the center beyond the projects included in this proposal by recruiting investigators and students from minority institutions in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska and prioritizing and encouraging pilot and center-affiliated studies in which they are involved. The collaborating institutions and partners are Heritage College (Hispanic and Native American-serving institution sited on the Yakima Indian Nation), Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium/Yukon-Kuskokwim Native Health Corporation, Yakima Valley Farm Workers Clinic, Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board/Northwest Tribal Epidemiology Center, Washington Dental Service an Foundation (major private dental insurer); and Medical Assistance Administration (Medicaid agency for Washington State).

"Oral Health Disparities in Publicly Insured Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for a NIH Career Award through the Faculty Transition Phase of the NIDCR Scholar Development and Faculty Transition Award. This application proposes a comprehensive interdisciplinary program of necessary training and mentorship to develop into an independent investigator. The applicant has an established record of commitment and interest in research and academic dentistry. Problem: There are significant disparities in access to dental care in this country, particularly for low-income children and those with special health care needs. Purpose: This project investigates disparities in access to dental care and pediatric performance measures of oral health care provided to children (1-18 years) enrolled in public insurance programs that currently exist in North Carolina and Virginia. Methods: North Carolina's (NC) public insurance dental plans (Medicaid/SCHIP) are administered as fee-for-service programs, while Virginia's (VA) publicly insured children are enrolled in both managed care organizations and fee-for-service dental programs. This project will examine the impact of health care organizational factors such as managed care versus fee-for-service programs and the difference in plan performance measures on pediatric oral health outcomes. Aims: The first study will describe the dynamics of enrollment and the access to dental services over a three-year period (2001-2003) of publicly insured children in both states. The second study will examine the performance of dental plans (utilization, effectiveness of prevention and quality) for children over this three-year period. The third study will examine the likelihood of hospital use versus the conventional dental setting for enrolled children 1-5 years of age. The fourth study is a feasibility project aimed at exploring the clinical implications of oral health case management in the medical arena.

"Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health A Center Addressing Disparities in Children's Oral Health is proposed at the University of California, San Francisco, with two primary institutional partners serving minority populations, the San Francisco Department of Public Health and the San Ysidro Community Health Center, a model health center located near the US-Mexican border, and additional collaborating institutions. The theme for this Center is to understand, prevent, and reduce oral health disparities among young children, with a primary focus on preventing early childhood caries. A secondary theme is to understand the interactions between the oral health and medical delivery systems that can affect children's oral health. These goals will be pursued from two primary directions: retrospective data- based projects to increase our understanding of the etiology of oral health disparities and to identify children most susceptible, and intervention projects to prevent disease. In this center we will 1) Support primarily patient and population-oriented research related to reducing oral health disparities in children; 2) Establish core facilities to provide technical services and resources to Center-affiliated projects; 3) Provide an enriched environment for training future health-care professionals and scientists, especially those from under-represented groups; 4) Establish mechanisms to increase collaboration among investigators in Center- supported projects, across health professions and affiliated collaborating public and private institutions on the west coast. Findings from this project will 1) identify cultural, environmental, workforce, behavioral, and biologic factors associated with health disparities among the ethnic/racial groups in the very diverse California environment; 2) enhance our ability to target children likely to be at risk for dental caries; 3) provide successful interdisciplinary interventions to prevent disease and reduce oral health disparities.

"Public Health Nurses as Oral Health Advocates:  A Feasibility Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has been well documented that a mother's oral health status is directly related to the oral health of her children, especially during the perinatal period. This association is complex, with maternal oral health status as well as maternal knowledge, attitudes and health behaviors all affecting the child's oral health. Early childhood caries (ECC), an infectious, chronic disease most commonly transmitted from mother to child, is a prime example of the maternal-child link. The earlier a child is infected with Mutans Streptococcus (MS), the bacteria primarily associated with dental caries, the greater the child's risk of developing dental caries. Mothers who have poorer oral health, especially the presence of untreated dental decay, are more likely to have higher rates of MS, more likely to infect their child and more likely to infect their child at an earlier age. Home visiting programs were specifically developed to reach underserved; at risk children and annually over 1 million children are estimated to receive health care in their homes. The home visiting model offers an ideal venue to incorporate oral health promotion activities aimed at reducing ECC prevalence since 1) these programs already target children at highest risk for dental disease, 2) health promotion is one of their primary aims, 3) health professionals provide preventive services and 4) home-based health care providers have less time constraints than clinic based providers. Building on the tenets of the chronic care model, this exploratory study is designed to assess the feasibility of public health nurses incorporating oral health promotion activities into an ongoing pre and post natal home visiting program. The specific aims include: 1) to determine if an oral health promotion model, with a focus on patient-centered counseling and ECC prevention, can be effectively delivered by nurses as part of an ongoing perinatal home visiting program; 2) to determine nurses' ability to accurately assess oral health status, in a home setting, and 3) to determine patient acceptance of oral health promotion being delivered by nurses. The long term goal of this study is to use these results to design and test a multifaceted intervention to prevent ECC that incorporates both patient centered counseling and fluoride varnish applications in a home visiting setting. Using this delivery strategy to address the oral health needs of high risk women and children, when replicated in other settings, could potentially have far reaching impact in eliminating oral disease and oral health disparities.          ",Public Health Nurses as Oral Health Advocates:  A Feasibility Study,7343036,R21DE018654,"['Counseling ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Purpose ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Advocate ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Rate ', ' Behavioral ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Fluorides ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Perinatal ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' House Call ', ' Home Visits ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Infection ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' pediatrician ', ' Literature ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nurses ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health Nurses ', ' Public Health Nursing ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Speech ', ' Streptococcus ', ' Streptococcus mutans ', ' S.mutans ', ' S. mutans ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tooth Diseases ', ' dental disorder ', ' dental disease ', ' Tooth Disorder ', ' Urination ', ' micturition ', ' Attitude ', ' Weight ', ' White Spots ', ' Dental White Spots ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Bacteria ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Services ', ' early childhood ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Absenteeism ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Home visitation ', ' home visit ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Prevalence ', ' chronic care model ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' ']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2007,243750,0.32226459060032625
"Oral health disparities in the first 4 decades of life DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective: The proposed research aims to use a life-course approach to develop a better understanding of the interplay of biological, environmental and behavioral determinants and antecedents of oral conditions from childhood to oral health by elucidating the nature, scale, persistence and potential mutability of oral health disparities in a population-based cohort of adults.      Methods: The Dunedin Study has traced the development of a representative 1972 birth cohort of 1,000 New Zealand men and women at birth and ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21 and 26. New data will be gathered at age 31, enabling analysis of oral health disparities data from childhood to age 31. The research will: (1) document the natural history of oral conditions through to the 4th decade of life; (2) examine the influence of earlier SES (and SES transitions) on adult oral health; (3) using periodontal disease as a model, test hypotheses about gene-environment interactions in the origins of poor adult oral health; and (4) determine the extent to which poor oral health is an important contributor to (a) poor physical health and (b) experience of adverse life outcomes by the 4th decade of life. The planned research will provide unique information on the scale, persistence and potential mutability of disparities in oral health through the first four decades of life, and will assist in identifying those clinical, public health and policy interventions, which are likely to be most appropriate and efficacious in reducing oral health disparities. The Dunedin Study offers a unique opportunity to conduct such an investigation because of the comprehensive data archive, which has already been assembled.

"Rural Older Adults: Oral Health, Diet & Quality of Life DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral health is central to physical and psychosocial well-being. Oral health deficits affect nutritional status through constraining dietary choices, and they can impair social interaction and integration due to pain, communication disorders, and embarrassment. While advances in preventive dentistry over the past half century have been dramatic, disparities in oral health continue to exist. Older rural adults are a particularly high risk population for oral health disparities; many have had limited access to oral health care services, high poverty rates and low socioeconomic status which place them at risk for oral health deficits relative to their urban and suburban counterparts. The high proportion of ethnic minorities among rural elders in some parts of the US makes disparities in oral health status within rural populations likely. This competing continuation application (R01 AG13469), which builds on eight years of community-based research on nutritional self-management and nutritional status in two rural, multi-ethnic North Carolina counties, has the overall goal of documenting the impact of oral health on multiple domains of life for rural adults > 60 years by accomplishing four specific aims: (1) to document the oral health status of older rural adults in a multi-ethnic population, and its association with gender, ethnicity, and other demographic predictors; (2) to delineate the nutritional impact of deficits in oral health, including food selection, food preparation, food consumption, nutrient intake, and nutritional status; (3) to document the relationship of oral health to social functioning, including communication and social interaction; and (4) to assess the impact of oral health on perceived well-being/quality of life (QoL, directly and as mediated by dietary intake and social functioning. Building on a foundation of community ethnography begun in 1996, this project will achieve its specific aims using a multi-method approach that integrates the results of qualitative research with older adults (in-depth interviews with 36 older adults experiencing oral health deficits) with a cross-sectional random epidemiological survey (n=750) and clinical examination (dentate only, n=450) of oral health and its consequences for nutritional status and quality of life among a tri-ethnic (African American, Native American and white) largely disadvantaged population of older adults.

"Oral health disparities in the first 4 decades of life Objective: The proposed research aims to use a life-course approach to develop a better understanding of the interplay of biological, environmental and behavioral determinants and antecedents of oral conditions from childhood to oral health by elucidating the nature, scale, persistence and potential mutability of oral health disparities in a population-based cohort of adults.  Methods: The Dunedin Study has traced the development of a representative 1972 birth cohort of 1,000 New Zealand men and women at birth and ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21 and 26. New data will be gathered at age 31, enabling analysis of oral health disparities data from childhood to age 31. The research will: (1) document the natural history of oral conditions through to the 4th decade of life; (2) examine the influence of earlier SES (and SES transitions) on adult oral health; (3) using periodontal disease as a model, test hypotheses about gene-environment interactions in the origins of poor adult oral health; and (4) determine the extent to which poor oral health is an important contributor to (a) poor physical health and (b) experience of adverse life outcomes by the 4t"" decade of life. The planned research will provide unique information on the scale, persistence and potential mutability of disparities in oral health through the first four decades of life, and will assist in identifying those clinical, public health and policy interventions which are likely to be most appropriate and efficacious in reducing oral health disparities. The Dunedin Study offers a unique opportunity to conduct such an investigation because of the comprehensive data archive which has already been assembled. Implications: The persistence of oral health disparities has not been investigated through the entire life course to date, and close examination of the degree to which the Dunedin cohort's early-life disparities in oral health persist into adulthood would be invaluable in determining whether (and to what extent) such inequalities can be reduced by clinical, public health or policy interventions.

"Reducing Oral Cancer Disparities in Florida DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Florida bears a disproportionate burden from cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx: in 2000, Florida had the nation's second highest age-adjusted incidence rate for females and fifth-highest rate for males, and had the second highest number of new cases. Black/African American and white males in Florida experience comparable incidence rates, but blacks experience significantly higher mortality rates and lower survival rates, suggesting that earlier detection may help reduce racial disparities in prognosis. This project seeks to promote oral cancer awareness and early detection among blacks/African Americans in Florida through the following Specific Aims: (1) Use a social marketing approach to develop a mass-media campaign on oral and pharyngeal cancer for a population at high risk for incidence and mortality; (2) Increase the proportion of the target population that knows the major risk factors, signs, and symptoms of oral and pharyngeal cancer; and (3) Increase the proportion of the target population that receives a clinical examination for oral and pharyngeal cancer. Using a theory-based social marketing approach guided by preliminary study findings, this project will develop culturally-appropriate, research-based educational messages and materials. The project will use two approaches to increase oral cancer awareness, knowledge, and preventive behaviors among black/African American adults in northeast Florida: 1) a wide-scale mass media approach centered in Duval County but reaching all surrounding counties; and 2) a targeted, faith-based effort among a network of primarily African American churches in medically and dentally underserved areas in northeast Florida. A toll free telephone hotline will be available to provide additional information and links to clinical facilities for exams. County health departments in northeast Florida will provide oral cancer examinations at their facilities, and onsite examinations will be provided by dentists at participating churches. Effectiveness of the interventions will be measured through population-based surveys and utilization of the hotline and clinics.

"Examining California's Oral Health Disparities: New Models and Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 2005 California Oral Health Needs Assessment of Children (COHNAC), a complex statewide health examination survey of over 21,000 kindergarten and third grade children, has shown decreases in the prevalence of untreated caries and slight decreases in caries experience since the 1993-4 COHNAC. However, these prevalences have not met Healthy People 2010 Objectives, California's children have the 2nd worst oral health of the 25 states reporting data, and children in families with low income and children of color continue to have worse oral health. Overall goals of this proposed project are to apply state-of-the-art HD methods in the 2005 COHNAC, to assess associations of some particular factors of acculturation, parental health literacy, and social environment in relation to oral health, to test and evaluate HD methods applied to oral health, and to provide a suite of methods/tools to colleagues that can be used in similar state oral health surveys and beyond. Specific Aims are: 1) To estimate oral health disparities (OHD) with traditional regression based measures as well as state-of-the art disparities measures (e.g. HCI and Thiel's index) in the 2005 statewide California Oral Health Needs Assessment of Children; 2) To use multiple imputation for missing questionnaire data and models to examine child, family, neighborhood and school factors (including acculturation and health literacy related measures) associated with California OHD; 3) To validate a multi-level ensemble statistical modeling approach combining recursive partitioning methods with complex survey sampling regression using computer simulations; and 4) To disseminate a) multiple imputed 2005 COHNAC data according to the UCSF CAN-DO data use policy and b) computer programs and documentation for HD indices and survey regression portion of ensemble models freely on the UCSF CAN-DO website. An overarching goal for HP 2010 is the elimination or reduction of health disparities (HDs) in the US population. More specific objectives include Objectives 21-1b and 21- 2b: to reduce the percentage of children with caries and untreated caries, respectively. Objective 11-2 is a developmental objective to improve health literacy among those with inadequate health literacy levels.

"Using CBPR to Improve Oral Health in Northern Plains In*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This community-based participatory research (CBPR) project by the Aberdeen Area Tribal Chairmen's Health Board and University of Iowa concerns American Indian children and a chronic disease that affects them disproportionately-early childhood caries (tooth decay). In tribal communities 79 percent of children have caries by first grade, compared to only 24 percent for all races. A large proportion of tribal children have an aggressive and destructive form of the disease called rampant early childhood caries (ECC). Rampant ECC causes a child pain, difficulty in eating, and speech delay. Despite implementation of caries-control measures found effective in other populations, the rate of ECC actually increased in tribal communities from 1991-1999. This research will use a CBPR model to combine existing and emerging anti-caries technologies, new behavioral intervention strategies, and new service delivery paradigms to reduce the health disparity from ECC in American Indian children. The wisdom and experience of the participating communities will guide the efforts of the investigators and consultants in all phases of this research. The long-term goal for this current three-year research cycle is to develop, test, and evaluate innovative, evidence based models to prevent ECC in Northern Plains tribal communities. The specific aims include the following: (1) Recruit three tribal communities to participate in the development and implementation of community-based research designed to improve the oral health of their children; (2) Assess the social, structural, and environmental strengths and barriers related to improving the oral health status of the children of the community; (3) Develop, implement, and pilot test evidence-based research projects to improve the oral health status of children that are both scientifically sound and fully endorsed by the community; (4) Evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions in terms of both process measures and short-term outcomes; and (5) Perform a qualitative assessment of the CBPR process and its impact on the infrastructure needed to improve the oral health of young children. This research will greatly expand the knowledge base for effective early childhood caries prevention in high prevalence communities throughout the country.         ",Using CBPR to Improve Oral Health in Northern Plains In*,7252633,R24MD001658,"['Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' PubMed ', ' Dentistry ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Population Group ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Qualifying ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Virulent ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Chairperson ', ' Chairwoman ', ' Chairman ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Infant ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Iowa ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Speech Delay ', ' Funding ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Nebraska ', ' Collaborations ', ' Native Americans ', ' North Dakota ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' General Anesthesia ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Schools ', ' programs ', ' sound ', ' South Dakota ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tribes ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Dimensions ', ' restoration ', ' Country ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' interest ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' early childhood ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Budgets ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' Toddler ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Preschool Child ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' United States Indian Health Service ', ' Indian Health Service ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Process Measure ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Communities ', ' care systems ', ' tribal community ', ' tribal communities ', ' tribal leader ', ' northern plains ', ' Outcome ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities ', ' NCMHD ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NIMHD,GREAT PLAINS TRIBAL CHAIRMEN'S HLTH BRD,R24,2007,462450,0.18881492255165813

"Ten Year Longitudinal Analyses/Risk for Dental Caries in HIV Seropositive Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well-established that dental caries (dental decay), one the most prevalent diseases in the United States, tends to disproportionably affect racial and ethnic minorities, and those who are economically and socially disadvantaged, and those with underlying medical problems. HIV+ persons are likely to be ethnic/racial minorities and are likely to be socio-economically disadvantaged, compared to HIV- persons. A recent 5-year investigation found that HIV infection was related to dental caries, but reasons for the disparity were unclear, and, perhaps most importantly, risk factors for caries within the HIV+ persons were not well defined as a result of this study. The objective of this proposed investigation is to clarify the relationship between HIV infection and dental caries. The Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) and its oral sub-study (WIHS-OS) represent one of the largest studied cohorts of HIV+ persons in the United States, and provide the largest collection medical, interview and dental data of HIV+ persons followed for an extended period of time, beginning in 1995 and ending only recently (November, 2004). As part of the WIHS-OS, 844, primarily minority, women (719 HIV+, 125 HIV-) were recruited from the parent WIHS core in 1995-96; in 2001/02, in order to investigate the effects of HIV medications on a variety of outcomes, an additional 173 HIV+ women were added, for a total of 1017 women. Participants had interviews, medical and dental exams every six months. We propose to examine, using standard and appropriate statistical methodologies, using the WIHS and the WIHS-OS, whether demographic factors (income, education, race/ethnicity, drug use), behavioral factors (smoking, illicit drug use, use of dental services and oral self-care), HIV disease severity, HIV medication use, and oral health factors (saliva, oral hygiene and gum disease) are related to the development of caries over ten years. These proposed analyses are different from analyses that have been previously done because they will include data collected over the entire 10-year period of observation, from all women in the WIHS-OS and because they will include analysis of factors that have not previously been examined in this group. These analyses provide the best opportunity to resolve currently unanswered questions regarding the nature of caries in HIV+ persons, given the size of the database, the long, prospective nature of the follow-up for dental caries, and the high quality of the data. The results of these analyses will provide greatly needed clinical, practical, and public health information to dental and medical providers, as well as to those persons and agencies that are indebted to caring for the medical, dental and social welfare of persons with HIV infection. Recent studies have found that HIV infection may predispose persons to the development of dental decay (caries) due to side effects from medications and because of health damaging and health promoting behaviors in HIV+ persons. This proposed study is relevant because will resolve currently unanswered questions regarding the nature of caries in HIV+ persons. The results of these analyses will provide greatly needed clinical, practical, and public health information to dental and medical providers, as well as to those persons and agencies that are indebted to caring for the medical, dental and social welfare of persons with HIV infection.          ",Ten Year Longitudinal Analyses/Risk for Dental Caries in HIV Seropositive Women,7282176,R03DE018375,"['Persons ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Saliva ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Welfare ', ' welfare ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Time ', ' Tooth Diseases ', ' dental disorder ', ' dental disease ', ' Tooth Disorder ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' United States ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Oral ', ' Salivary ', ' Pattern ', ' size ', ' Behavior ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Services ', ' Participant ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' CD4/CD8 ratio procedure ', ' T4-T8 Ratio ', ' CD4-CD8 Ratio ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' response ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HAART ', ' Cocaine ', ' 8-Azabicyclo(3.2.1)octane-2-carboxylic acid, 3-(benzoyloxy)-8-methyl-, methyl ester, (1R-(exo,exo))- ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Accounting ', ' oral HIV ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Provider ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Preventive ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Rate ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Root Caries ', ' Affect ', ' Secondary to ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Gingival Recession ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' patient home care ', ' patient homecare ', ' Home Care ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Interview ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Data Quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Matched Group ', ' Methamphetamine ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Benzeneethanamine, N,alpha-dimethyl-, (S)- ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' ']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R03,2007,76645,0.1713881183012993
"Molecular Analysis of the Biofilm in Caries and Health DESCRIPTION: Dental caries is the most common chronic disease of childhood, and is the biggest unmet health care need among America's children. Socioeconomic disparities in both rates of disease and treatment are a major public health issue. To date, effective biological interventions to prevent caries have not been developed. Dental plaque contains several hundred different organisms, many of which are poorly studied. A number of species have been shown to produce sufficient acid to drive pH below critical levels and to tolerate low pH. Research has primarily focused on Streptococcus mutans as the etiologic agent in caries, but based the work of previous investigators using cultivation and on our preliminary findings using molecular methods, S. mutans is not always present in caries, is often found at low levels, and additional and unexpected bacterial species may be important. In addition, comparatively little attention has been paid to identifying health-associated and potentially beneficial bacterial species that may reside in the oral cavity. For the proposed project, bacterial species present in childhood caries and health will be identified by cloning and sequencing bacterial 16S ribosomal genes amplified from DNA isolated from plaque samples. This open ended approach will allow the detection and identification of all bacterial species present, including novel, uncultivated or unexpected species. The presence and quantities of the species identified by this approach as potentially associated with caries or health will then be determined using quantitative, real-time PCR. This dual-technique approach will allow the examination of a much larger sample size than is possible by cloning and sequencing alone. Accomplishment of the proposed studies will identify the pathogens associated with the onset and progression of severe caries of the primary and young permanent dentition, and identify those bacterial species associated with a healthy dentition. This study will also provide a comprehensive catalog of the supragingival flora in children based on molecular technology. The significance of the proposed work is that identification of additional caries pathogens would provide alternative targets for biological interventions, and identification of beneficial health-associated species could provide the basis for therapeutic interventions to establish caries-resistant microbial communities.

"MEASURING & DOCUMENTING DISPARITIES IN ORAL HEALTH: A PRACTICAL APPROACH    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While some improvements in the health of the United States (US) population have occurred over time, the persistence of disparities between groups, namely racial/ethnic or socioeconomic groups, indicates that such improvement has been uneven. Although these disparities have been documented over the years and some studies have attempted to examine trends over time, it has been challenging to estimate the magnitude and direction of these disparities across groups due to the lack of a uniform or standard methodology to measure health disparities and their trends across time. Oral health disparities are not an exception to this challenge. The goal of this proposal is to develop and test a methodology to assess oral health disparities in dental caries and periodontal diseases across populations over time. In order to accomplish this goal, we propose the following two specific aims: Aim 1: Use data from NHANES III to develop sensitive methods to measure disparities in dental caries and periodontal disease in the US population accounting for the difference in case definitions across studies. These methods will be developed considering and accounting for: a) the distribution of disease in the population by age, gender, race/ethnicity and socioeconomic position (SEP) indicators; b) the selection of the best reference group; and c) the comparison of results obtained using relative versus absolute measures of disease. Aim 2: Use data from NHANES 1999-2002 to test the measures developed in Aim 1 to assess oral health disparities in dental caries and periodontal disease. Testing the validity and reliability of the developed methodology in Aim 1 using the NHANES 1999-2002 data will allow us to provide guidelines and recommendations for the use of uniform and standardized measures to document the existing oral health disparities in studies at the local and national levels across groups of the population over time. This proposal's aims are consistent with the NIDCR Strategic Plan's Crosscutting Areas-Health Disparities and Data acquisition and Analysis-and the Healthy People 2010's goal of eliminating health disparities among segment of the US population. Specifically, accomplishing this proposed study's aims has the potential to contribute to our understanding of oral health disparities in the US; to provide the tools to gauge the magnitude and direction of oral health disparities using uniform measures in studies at the local and national levels; and to recommend guidelines for oral health disparity comparisons across studies and populations over time. Finally, the developed measures have the potential to be used to measure health disparities related to age, gender, race/ethnicity and socioeconomic position on other oral health outcomes and health outcomes in general.           ",MEASURING & DOCUMENTING DISPARITIES IN ORAL HEALTH: A PRACTICAL APPROACH,7613110,R03DE017901,"['Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Population Group ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' trend ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Guidelines ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Periodontal Diseases ', ' periodontium disorder ', ' periodontium disease ', ' periodontal disorder ', ' Parodontosis ', ' Periodontal Index ', ' tool ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Accounting ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' data acquisition ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NIDCR,HERBERT H.

"Association between oral health of mothers and their children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the significant advances in the understanding and prevention of dental caries there has been little change in the high prevalence of dental caries in low income children. Additionally, children from this group, who need care the most, are the ones that are least likely to obtain it. Previous research has found that mothers' attitudes and beliefs are important determinants in the oral health status and dental care utilization of their children. To our knowledge there are no studies of the association between mothers' and children's oral health status. We hypothesize that: mothers who have high caries levels will have children with high caries; mothers who report irregular dental care utilization will have children who have irregular dental care; and mothers who have perceived dental needs will report needs for their children. The specific aims of this study are: 1 To compare oral health outcomes (dental caries, mother's missing teeth, and self-assessed oral health status) of mothers and their children. 2. To compare dental care utilization (length since last dental visits, reasons for visit and reason for lack of visit in the past year) between mothers and their children. 3. To determine if there is an association between oral health needs (unmet needs, perceived needs) of mothers and their children; and to compare mothers' perceived with children's normative needs. Data for this project come from linked data for mothers and their child from the NHANES III (children ages 2- 6) and from the 1999 National Health Interview Survey (children ages 2- 6). After gathering descriptive statistics, bivariate relationships between mothers' and their child's health outcomes will be calculated. Then logistic regression models will be fit to determine predictors of children's outcomes, dental care utilization, and dental needs. These models will be determined following Andersen's model of health outcomes (1995), where mother's and child's characteristics (such as race/ethnicity, poverty status, dental insurance, etc) determine use of oral health care and, they all, determine oral health outcomes. A positive association between mothers and children oral health status, care utilization and perceived needs will suggest that intervening with mothers may reduce dental caries prevalence in their children by several mechanisms. Thus, identifying maternal health behaviors and related oral health status are not only important for understanding the prevalence of dental disease in their children, but are important for designing prevention plans to reduce oral health disparities and enable the objectives of Health People 2010.           ",Association between oral health of mothers and their children,7193597,R03DE017123,"['Age ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Dental Insurance ', ' dental health insurance ', ' Periodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontia insurance ', ' Oral Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Maternal Behavior ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mothers ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Poverty ', ' tool ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Knowledge ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Tooth structure ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth Diseases ', ' dental disorder ', ' dental disease ', ' Tooth Disorder ', ' United States ', ' Attitude ', ' Severities ', ' Oral ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' craniofacial ', ' craniofacies ', ' early childhood ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Modeling ', ' Abate ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Prevalence ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Length ', ' Caring ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Improve Access ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Injury ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R03,2007,148500,0.2701413721557929
"Oral/Pharyngeal Cancer Incidence from Medicare Claims    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral and pharyngeal cancer has remained a persistent oral health problem among the elderly in the United States. Survival rates have shown little improvement over the past decades. Health disparities also exist such as higher incidence and lower survival among racial and ethnic minority populations. Baseline and trend data by which progress can be measured are lacking-particularly among the underserved populations most in need of intervention. The goals of this research are to derive and validate an algorithm based on Medicare claims to identify incident oral and pharyngeal cancer cases among Medicare beneficiaries. This algorithm will be derived using the Surveillence, Epidimiology and End Result (SEER)-Medicare linked database. These data provide a unique linkage of the SEER tumor registry with Medicare claims, ie, it combines the ""gold standard"" tumor registry with the health claims of the largest insurer of the elderly in the United States. Half of the data will be randomly allocated to determine the algorithm, and the other have will be used for validation. This algorithm will have broad applications that include generating and improving upon oral and pharyngeal cancer baseline and trend data, which the National Institutes of Dental and Craniofacial Research have noted are lacking. This algorithm will also allow future studies to link cancer diagnoses with Medicare claims to study of prevention, early detection and treatment of oral and pharyngeal cancer. The strength in numbers of this population-based study, including racial and ethnic minority popuations, make this research a useful first step toward improving the oral health of the elderly as well as reducing health disparities. For this study, we will use Medicare claims to determine the best combination of procedures and diagnoses that identify individuals with oral and pharyngeal cancer. The ability to identify these cancer cases from Medicare claims will facilitate a cost-effective way to accurately measure the burden of oral and pharyngeal cancer, and to investigate the effectiveness of prevention, early detection and treatment strategies for this debilitating disease.           ",Oral/Pharyngeal Cancer Incidence from Medicare Claims,7194468,R03DE016958,"['Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Societies ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Oropharyngeal ', ' oral pharyngeal ', ' Oropharynxs ', ' Oropharynx ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' craniofacial ', ' craniofacies ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' member ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Sampling ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' cost ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' Coupling ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' tumor ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Rate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pharynx ', ' Pharynx Cancer ', ' Pharyngeal Cancer ', ' Pharnyx Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Pharynx ', ' Malignant Pharyngeal Tumor ', ' Malignant Pharyngeal Neoplasm ', ' beneficiary ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Au element ', ' Aging ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Algorithms ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' African ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Marital Status ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2007,147000,0.13108992537614314
"Understanding Barriers to Oral Health Care In Pregnancy: The First Step to Improv    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral health diseases such as childhood caries and periodontal diseases are prevalent conditions that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and disadvantaged individuals. Dental caries is the most common chronic childhood disease, affecting 5 times more children than asthma. Caries leads to tooth loss, with subsequent nutritional and social consequences. Adult periodontal disease affects up to 40% of reproductive age women, and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia. Effective preventive and treatment measures to reduce the morbidity of caries and periodontal disease exist, and data suggest that treatment of maternal oral disease may improve the oral health of the offspring and reduce risk for adverse pregnancy outcome. However, despite the presence of these evidence-based interventions to prevent or reduce the burden of oral diseases among children and women, both caries and periodontal disease remain prevalent, particularly among low-income families and members of racial and ethnic minorities. Our long-term goal is to reduce morbidity of oral diseases among pregnant women and their children, and to eliminate disparities in oral health. We hypothesize that maternal knowledge about and attitudes toward oral health, as well as lack of access to oral health services, greatly affect maternal behaviors that promote the oral health of both the mother and her offspring. The primary objective of this study is to identify barriers to oral health care among pregnant women, particularly racial and ethic minorities and those of lower socio-economic status, and then develop intervention strategies for removing or lowering the barriers so that existing evidence-based interventions can be more effectively applied. We will pursue this objective by achieving the following specific aims: 1. Collect and analyze data to understand pregnant women's current practices, attitudes, and perceived system barriers regarding optimal dental health. 2. Test the feasibility, acceptability, and likely use of four to eight potential interventions to remove and/or reduce barriers and encourage improved oral health practices. 3. Conduct pilot study of one or more interventions developed in aim 2. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team with strength in oral health in pregnancy, public health programming, behavioral research, qualitative analysis and public policy. Findings from this research will provide the framework for development of innovative, culturally sensitive strategies and approaches to improve the health and well-being of mothers and their children by reducing barriers to oral health care. Oral health diseases are prevalent conditions that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and disadvantaged individuals. Despite the presence of evidence-based interventions and effective preventive and treatment measures, oral diseases remain prevalent.

"Dental Caries: Whole Genome Association and Gene x Environment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dental caries (also known as tooth decay) remains the most common chronic disease of childhood. Although overall caries prevalence has declined over the last 40 years, dental caries in the primary dentition and mean caries rates in children ages 2-11 has increased markedly over the past 12 years. Childhood caries is a serious public health issue because of associated health problems and because disparities in oral health have led to substantially higher average disease prevalence among children in poverty and in underserved racial and ethnic groups. These issues are of such concern that in 2005, the American Academy of Pediatrics made children's oral health one of their top areas of focus, as it is for the majority of the NIDCR ""Disparities Centers."" Multiple factors contribute to a person's risk for caries, including environmental factors such as diet, oral hygiene, fluoride exposure and the level of colonization of cariogenic bacteria and host factors such as salivary flow. There are still individuals who appear to be more susceptible to caries and those that are extremely resistant, regardless of the environmental risk factors to which they are exposed, implying that genetic factors also play an important role in caries etiology. This conclusion is supported by studies in both humans and animals, with the most compelling evidence coming from studies of twins reared apart in which investigators found significant resemblance within monozygotic (MZ) but not dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs for percentage of teeth and surfaces restored or carious and estimated the genetic contribution to caries as 40%. Despite the strong evidence of a genetic component to risk for dental caries, there have been only a few studies of candidate genes in caries, and no published genome-wide scans. Therefore, the goal of this study is to perform genome-wide association (GWA) studies of dental caries with a large panel of SNPs (500,000 or more) in families and individuals ascertained through multiple US sites. There will be an initial GWA scan in samples from three sites (University of Pittsburgh, University of Iowa, and University of Washington), with follow-up studies in additional collaborating sites (University of Michigan and UCSF). Successful completion of this study will allow a better understanding of the biology of dental caries, and will lead to earlier identification of children at risk for dental caries, thereby allowing improved and targeted interventions.             ",Dental Caries: Whole Genome Association and Gene x Environment Studies,7326149,U01DE018903,"['Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Enamel ', ' tooth enamel ', ' Enamel ', ' Diet ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Range ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Exhibits ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Fluorides ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Depth ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Phase ', ' Iowa ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Michigan ', ' Persons ', ' Twin Studies ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Host Factor ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Animals ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' programs ', ' Time ', ' Tooth structure ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Dizygotic Twins ', ' Fraternal Twins ', ' Universities ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Washington ', ' Salivary ', ' tooth surface ', ' Biology ', ' American ', ' early childhood ', ' Buffers ', ' California ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Primary Dentition ', ' Deciduous Dentition ', ' Gender ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Early identification ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Academy ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' cariogenic bacteria ', ' SNP genotyping ', ' Prevalence ', ' Heritability ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' environmental allergy ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2007,492465,0.20563174192481917
"Longitudinal Study of Dental Caries in VLBW Infants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This longitudinal study addresses the relationship between birth weight and early childhood caries (ECC) in a cohort of pre-term very low birth weight (VLBW) and full-term normal birth weight (NBW) infants. VLBW and ECC disproportionately affects poor and minority children costing Medicaid billions of dollars annually for treatment. The improved survival of VLBW children has resulted in greater long-term disabilities and need for health services, thus classifying them as children with special health care needs. The oral health needs of VLBW children have not been adequately studied. VLBW children are known to have a high prevalence of enamel defects in the primary dentition, which in turn can lead to increased susceptibility to ECC. Socio- behavioral factors that can predispose some children to ECC are unknown in VLBW children. Therefore the primary aims of the study are to (1) assess the incidence of ECC in VLBW and NBW infants; (2) assess mediators such as the incidence of developmental enamel defects, S.mutans infection and the extent of oral health behaviors in VLBW and NEW infants; (3) assess the indirect relationship between birth weight and ECC via mediators after controlling for independent moderating variables. A total of 200 VLBW and 200 NBW infants will be followed at 8 and 18-20 months corrected age. The proposed study will collect data on caries (decayed and filled surfaces), mediating biological variables (enamel hypoplasia and opacity, S.mutans levels) and infant oral health behavior (feeding, diet, oral hygiene practices, and dental access), and independent variables (demographics, parent predisposing, enabling, need characteristics, dental behavior, biological and child medical factors). Data analysis for testing aims 1 and 2 includes the generalized estimating equations (GEE) models, and a two-stage structural equations model (SEM) for testing the role of mediators in aim 3. The sample size provide 85 to 99% power to compare the two groups in terms of the three study aims. The results of this study will provide critical data to address the knowledge gaps in taking care of VLBW children. The clinical implications include primary prevention, early diagnosis and treatment to prevent further susceptibility to dental decay. It is also of public health interest since interventions to target knowledge, attitude, beliefs, and oral health practices can be implemented in programs for special needs children, and there by improve both oral and systemic health.           ",Longitudinal Study of Dental Caries in VLBW Infants,7315399,R01DE017947,"['Live Birth ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' interest ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Equation ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' early childhood ', ' mental development ', ' cohort ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Reporting ', ' Primary Dentition ', ' Deciduous Dentition ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' cost ', ' feeding ', ' Minority ', ' demographics ', ' Attitude ', ' Washington ', ' Oral ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Enamel ', ' tooth enamel ', ' Enamel ', ' Dental Enamel Hypoplasia ', ' Hypoplastic Enamel ', ' Enamel Hypoplasia ', ' Enamel Agenesis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diet ', ' Purpose ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Older Population ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Affect ', ' Dental General Practice ', ' dental practice ', ' Age ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Needs ', ' Alaska ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Survivors ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Infection ', ' Dental Insurance ', ' dental health insurance ', ' Periodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontia insurance ', ' Oral Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Surgery Insurance ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Dental ', ' disability ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Numbers ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Sample Size ', ' Perinatal Care ', ' Medicaid ', ' Medicine ', ' Collaborations ', ' Very Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' very low birth weight infant human ', ' very low birth weight ', ' VLBW (human) ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Dental Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Streptococcus mutans ', ' S.mutans ', ' S. mutans ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Attention ', ' ']",NIDCR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,425071,0.19483193891418546
"Oral Health in People with Systemic Sclerosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of our proposed research is to understand the oral health status, oral health- related behaviors, and quality of life in the US population of patients with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma or SSc). SSc is a rare, progressive connective tissue disease that affects predominately women (3.8:1) with a higher risk of the severe form among African-Americans. SSc adults experience manifestations of the systemic disease that include microstomia, xerostomia, and impaired manual dexterity. The two specific aims of this study are: 1) to characterize the oral health status of adults with SSc, and 2) to determine the SSc disease specific manifestations (microstomia, xerostomia, and manual dexterity impairments) that are associated with the severity of oral health problems and oral health-related quality of life among adults with SSc. This first study of US adults with SSc is a cross-sectional survey of 250 adults with SSc in South Carolina. This population is 25% African-American which is similar to the racial distribution of SSc in the US adult population. Data collection includes information on: oral health status (periodontal, dental, mucosal and microbial), oral manifestations of SSc (size of oral aperture, severity of oral dryness, and manual dexterity for oral hygiene), and oral health-related behaviors and quality of life. The oral health status of the South Carolina SSc population will be compared to that of the adult US population based on an analysis of corresponding measures using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002 data. Multivariable regression modeling will be used to evaluate hypothesized risk and protective factors that are associated with oral health status in adults with SSc. Results of this study in South Carolina will be used in regional efforts for the development of interventions for improved oral health status of adults with SSc. Second, these results will provide the basis for a larger US study of oral health problems of adults with SSc. The public health impact of this study will be the application of the greater understanding of the oral health status, oral health related behaviors, and quality of life of patients with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma or SSc). It is hoped that risks and protective factors can be identified to be associated with the oral health status of adults with systemic sclerosis, leading to the development of interventions for improved oral health in this population, and providing the basis for a larger study of oral health problems of adults with systemic sclerosis.          ",Oral Health in People with Systemic Sclerosis,7314648,R21DE017360,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Facilities ', ' dental health care facility ', ' Dental Staff ', ' dental personnel ', ' Scleroderma ', ' dermatosclerosis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Dryness ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Subgroup ', ' Centers of Research Excellence ', ' Center of Biomedical Research Excellence ', ' COBRE ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' Exhibits ', ' Behavioral ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Dental Insurance ', ' dental health insurance ', ' Periodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontia insurance ', ' Oral Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Surgery Insurance ', ' Ensure ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Dental ', ' Literature ', ' Living Wills ', ' living will ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Manuals ', ' Microstomia ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Respondent ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Oral Manifestations ', ' Patients ', ' Periodontal Diseases ', ' periodontium disorder ', ' periodontium disease ', ' periodontal disorder ', ' Parodontosis ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Systemic Scleroderma ', ' progressive systemic sclerosis ', ' Systemic Sclerosis ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' South Carolina ', ' Time ', ' Tooth structure ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Xerostomia ', ' dry mouth ', ' aptyalism ', ' Mouth Dryness ', ' Hyposalivation ', ' Asialia ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Severities ', ' Oral ', ' Systemic disease ', ' size ', ' Behavior ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' craniofacial ', ' craniofacies ', ' experience ', ' microbial ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Disease regression ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' health related quality of life ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' Microbe ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Connective Tissue Diseases ', ' Connective Tissue Disorder ', ' ']",NIDCR,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2007,182500,0.325876573871514
"Reducing Oral Cancer Disparities in Florida DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Florida bears a disproportionate burden from cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx: in 2000, Florida had the nation's second highest age-adjusted incidence rate for females and fifth-highest rate for males, and had the second highest number of new cases. Black/African American and white males in Florida experience comparable incidence rates, but blacks experience significantly higher mortality rates and lower survival rates, suggesting that earlier detection may help reduce racial disparities in prognosis. This project seeks to promote oral cancer awareness and early detection among blacks/African Americans in Florida through the following Specific Aims: (1) Use a social marketing approach to develop a mass-media campaign on oral and pharyngeal cancer for a population at high risk for incidence and mortality; (2) Increase the proportion of the target population that knows the major risk factors, signs, and symptoms of oral and pharyngeal cancer; and (3) Increase the proportion of the target population that receives a clinical examination for oral and pharyngeal cancer. Using a theory-based social marketing approach guided by preliminary study findings, this project will develop culturally-appropriate, research-based educational messages and materials. The project will use two approaches to increase oral cancer awareness, knowledge, and preventive behaviors among black/African American adults in northeast Florida: 1) a wide-scale mass media approach centered in Duval County but reaching all surrounding counties; and 2) a targeted, faith-based effort among a network of primarily African American churches in medically and dentally underserved areas in northeast Florida. A toll free telephone hotline will be available to provide additional information and links to clinical facilities for exams. County health departments in northeast Florida will provide oral cancer examinations at their facilities, and onsite examinations will be provided by dentists at participating churches. Effectiveness of the interventions will be measured through population-based surveys and utilization of the hotline and clinics.

"Planning for International Studies of Population Oral Health Determinants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are powerful ""macro-level"" determinants of health that are fixed within populations, but which vary between populations. We hypothesize that quantifiable national macro-level determinants can be identified that will explain variation in oral health above and beyond variation attributable to characteristics of individuals within nations. Objectives: In response to PAR-06-219, the goals of this two-year planning project are to develop a study protocol and funding applications to investigate macro-level determinants of oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL). The project has four Specific Aims: 1) to assemble a collaborative team of researchers who have measured OHRQoL in six national surveys; 2) to establish new collaborations with researchers from other disciplines so that we can identify a comprehensive set of macro-level determinants; 3) to undertake preliminary studies of hypothesized macro-level determinants of oral health from each country; and 4) to develop a detailed study protocol that would undertake analysis of available datasets with multiple levels of health determinants. Relevance: These aims are of direct relevance to Goal 7 of the NIH/NIDCR strategic plan that seeks to ""Assess the social, educational and economic impact of oral ... conditions"" and of Healthy People 2010 which aims ""to help individuals of all ages increase life expectancy and improve their quality of life"". Research design: During the first year of NIH funding, we will hold one face-to-face investigators' meeting and monthly teleconference calls among the applicants. The meetings will be concerned primarily with hypothesis generation and identification of data sources. Between meetings, pilot studies will be undertaken to address methodology at each of the applicant institutions (Adelaide, Australia; Newcastle, UK; and Oulu, Finland). The primary outcomes for Year 1 will be: a) expansion of the team of investigators to include five additional consultants; b) compilation of a data dictionary describing oral health survey items and macro-level variables available in six countries; and c) methodological pilot studies examining macro-level determinants of oral health within three of the collaborating countries. In Year 2, we will identify new contextual variables, finalize hypotheses and complete pilot studies for the Year 2 grant application. At the second face-to-face meeting of the expanded group of investigators, pilot investigations conducted during Year 1 will be reviewed. Those results will also help finalization of the conceptual framework that was initiated in Year 1. We will spend the remainder of the year working with newly-recruited investigators to identify data sources from their own disciplines (e.g. geography, economics) that will be included in the Year 2 grant application. We will also complete the manuscript begun in Year 1 and submit it for publication. Finally, we plan to submit funding applications to at least two agencies that support international collaborative studies. Project Narrative: This project is relevant to public health because it will develop a study identifying ""macro-level"" features of nations that influence population oral health. Examples of macro-level determinants include social services and health programs, both in the public and private sector. In addition to identifying upstream causes of health disparities within countries, the planned study can point to health policy interventions needed to improve health in those nations.          ",Planning for International Studies of Population Oral Health Determinants,7449834,R21DE018980,"['Risk Factors ', ' Sociology ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Teleconferences ', ' United Kingdom ', ' United States ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Australia ', ' Dimensions ', ' Oral ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Country ', ' Belief ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Population Study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Censuses ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Tooth Loss ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Oral Health Impact Profile ', ' oral status ', ' health related quality of life ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Data Sources ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Dentistry ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Dictionary ', ' Institution ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' International ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Social Health Services ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Finland ', ' Geography ', ' Germany ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Dental ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Malaysia ', ' Malaya ', ' Malay Federation ', ' Federation of Malaya ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' National Health Policy ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Private Sector ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Condition ', ' Records ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE,R21,2008,106337,0.23665924578751676
"Association between oral health of mothers and their children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the significant advances in the understanding and prevention of dental caries there has been little change in the high prevalence of dental caries in low income children. Additionally, children from this group, who need care the most, are the ones that are least likely to obtain it. Previous research has found that mothers' attitudes and beliefs are important determinants in the oral health status and dental care utilization of their children. To our knowledge there are no studies of the association between mothers' and children's oral health status. We hypothesize that: mothers who have high caries levels will have children with high caries; mothers who report irregular dental care utilization will have children who have irregular dental care; and mothers who have perceived dental needs will report needs for their children. The specific aims of this study are: 1 To compare oral health outcomes (dental caries, mother's missing teeth, and self-assessed oral health status) of mothers and their children. 2. To compare dental care utilization (length since last dental visits, reasons for visit and reason for lack of visit in the past year) between mothers and their children. 3. To determine if there is an association between oral health needs (unmet needs, perceived needs) of mothers and their children; and to compare mothers' perceived with children's normative needs. Data for this project come from linked data for mothers and their child from the NHANES III (children ages 2- 6) and from the 1999 National Health Interview Survey (children ages 2- 6). After gathering descriptive statistics, bivariate relationships between mothers' and their child's health outcomes will be calculated. Then logistic regression models will be fit to determine predictors of children's outcomes, dental care utilization, and dental needs. These models will be determined following Andersen's model of health outcomes (1995), where mother's and child's characteristics (such as race/ethnicity, poverty status, dental insurance, etc) determine use of oral health care and, they all, determine oral health outcomes. A positive association between mothers and children oral health status, care utilization and perceived needs will suggest that intervening with mothers may reduce dental caries prevalence in their children by several mechanisms. Thus, identifying maternal health behaviors and related oral health status are not only important for understanding the prevalence of dental disease in their children, but are important for designing prevention plans to reduce oral health disparities and enable the objectives of Health People 2010.           ",Association between oral health of mothers and their children,7449720,R03DE017123,"['Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Length ', ' Caring ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Improve Access ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Injury ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Dental Insurance ', ' dental health insurance ', ' Periodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontia insurance ', ' Oral Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Maternal Behavior ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mothers ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Poverty ', ' tool ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Knowledge ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Tooth structure ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth Diseases ', ' dental disorder ', ' dental disease ', ' Tooth Disorder ', ' United States ', ' Attitude ', ' Severities ', ' Oral ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' craniofacial ', ' craniofacies ', ' early childhood ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Modeling ', ' Abate ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Prevalence ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R03,2008,73433,0.2701413721557929
"Southeast Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A multi-disciplinary Center built on strong community partnerships is proposed at the University of Florida to foster research, dissemination of findings, and training on disparities in oral health. The initial theme of this Center is to reduce disparities in cancer survival by promoting early detection of oral and pharyngeal cancer (OPC) through two community-based theoretically-derived intervention projects. Community-based interventions built on strong theory are rare in oral health disparity research. A major strength of this application is the inclusion of an evidence base to support our research methodology. The first project will refine and upgrade health care providers' ability to detect early stages of OPC using evidence-based health education theory and the second will apply theoretically derived health promotion models to increase the likelihood that African American men obtain regular OPC screening exams. An R21-level project to validate a cellular biomarker related to susceptibility to squamous cell carcinoma is also proposed. The second theme of this Center is to apply community-based research principles gleaned from aforementioned work to follow-up projects that will address communities' oral health needs. One such R21-level developmental project will determine feasibility of conducting large scale preventive and treatment intervention in a well defined population of low-income minority children with aggressive periodontitis. It is expected that both R21-level projects will lead to full community-based interventions. This Center will facilitate oral health disparity research by 1) providing new resources through which multi-disciplinary teams jointly conduct targeted community-based intervention research; 2) strengthening the partnerships among researchers, clinicians, and the community; and 3) developing a pipeline of oral health disparity researchers and leaders. Our longstanding partnerships enable us to disseminate the results of our research such that we influence the dental/medical community, community members/patients, and policymakers alike. As proposed, the Center will produce a synergistic force resulting in a measurable reduction of disparities in oral health among the underserved. Community partners include the Alachua County Organization for Rural Needs (ACORN, a clinic to serve low-income rural and minority patients), Florida state dental organizations, Department of Health, faith-based community organizations (ACTION network and 4A's), and Florida A&M University, a historically Black College/University. The research conducted by the Southeast Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health (CRRDOH) will generate an evidence base that will affect public policy and will result in long term benefits for disadvantaged citizens.    ",Southeast Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health,7533118,U54DE019261,[''],NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,U54,2008,1261268,0.29085152574150813
"Understanding Sources of Children's Oral Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The purpose of this application is to empirically examine the influence of individual, family, community and state level characteristics on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in children's oral health and health care. The data will come primarily from the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH), conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is a population-based survey of approximately 102,000 children ages 0-17 years nationwide, including independent, representative samples of approximately 2,000 children from each state and the District of Columbia (DC). It will be augmented with state-level contextual variables derived from other sources. Multilevel modeling methods will be used in the empirical analysis. The three specific aims of this project are to: 1) Identify and quantify the relative contributions of individual, family, community, and state-level factors that explain disparities in children's oral health status and oral health care using the NSCH, thus furthering our understanding of oral health disparities, their sources and potential remedies; 2) Identify differences across states in children's oral health status and oral health care and the factors that contribute to those differences. Our goal under this specific aim is to identify mutable state-level factors (e.g., water fluoridation policies, state dental public health infrastructure, and availability of dental health professionals) that can lead to improvements in children's oral health and reduce disparities in oral health status and oral health care, and; 3) Establish a web based system using the NSCH database that augments existing systems and can be used by policy makers, researchers and advocates to compare and track children's oral health and oral health care disparities, including baseline data for each state and DC from 2003 and comparison data from the 2007 NSCH when it becomes available. We have established a working relationship with the federal MCH Bureau-CDC supported Data Resource Center to include our results on their website devoted to the 2003 NSCH (www.nschdata.org). This frequently used web resource will provide an excellent home for the data developed under this study. Accomplishing these specific aims will provide helpful information for dental care practitioners, families, federal and state health policymakers, and dental health services researchers concerning child, family and community level influences on oral health and oral health disparities. Our overarching goal in this project is to identify significant and modifiable factors that influence children's oral health disparities nationally and across states. This information can then be used to help guide federal and state policies to reduce disparities in oral health status and oral health care. Project Narrative: An overarching goal for HP 2010 is the elimination or reduction of health disparities in the US population. This proposal is responsive to that priority. It is also responsive to several components of the NIDCR Strategic Plan, including Goal 6 (eliminating health disparities in oral, dental and craniofacial diseases and conditions among underserved populations and groups) and Goal 7 (ensuring the adequacy of systems to document and monitor the extent and impact of oral, dental and craniofacial diseases, disorders and conditions). The diverse and cross-disciplinary study team proposed for this project is responsive to Goal 4 (supporting research infrastructure and enhancing the development of new approaches for conducting inter- and cross-disciplinary research).          ",Understanding Sources of Children's Oral Health Disparities,7470323,R21DE018523,"['Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Health Services ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Population Group ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Assessing contribution of the dental care system to oral health care disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited access to dental care exacerbates oral health care disparities in underserved populations. The barriers in access at the individual level have been explored to a large extent; however, the impact of the dental care system on access is poorly understood. Reduced access has been linked to a lower overall supply of dentists, but little is known about the relationship between the specific characteristics of dental providers, such as education and practice setting, and access. The specific aims of this project are: 1) to assess the impact of dentist characteristics on access to dental care of underserved populations; and 2) to assess the potential differences in impact of dentist characteristics on specific categories of the underserved, such as children, low- income, and racial/ethnic populations. Using Andersen's conceptual framework of access to care, it is hypothesized that access to dental care is influenced by the context in which dental care is delivered, or the dental care system, in addition to individual characteristics. Measures of the dental care system are primarily conceptualized as personal and practice characteristics of dentists in the medical study service area where individuals reside. The data for this study include an existing population-based survey of individuals, an existing representative survey of dentists in private practice, and existing administrative data. The dependent variables (length of time since last dental visit and unmet dental care) and individual level independent variables will be obtained from the population survey. Independent variables measuring personal and practice characteristics of dentists will be obtained from the dentist survey. Examples of the latter measures are percentages of private practice dentists in the medical study service area who accept discounted fees, participate in public insurance programs, or have large practices (as indicated by number of various personnel and multiple practice locations). Additional independent variables on supply or availability of other dental care providers will be obtained from administrative data (e.g. designation of dental health professional shortage area, number of visits to community-based clinics). The impact of dentist characteristics on access will be examined in multinomial and dichotomous logistic regression models, controlling for individual and other predictors of access to dental care. Both models will be stratified by subgroups of underserved populations to assess potential differences in predictors of access among groups. Improving access to dental care is the solution most likely to reduce observed disparities in oral health of underserved populations. Research that identifies systemic barriers in access to care of the underserved populations is needed to inform policies designed to diminish oral health disparities.

"Severe Early Childhood Caries: Role of Dietary Cariogenicity and Eating Patterns    Description (provided by applicant): Early childhood caries is a serious pediatric health problem that disproportionately impacts children of lower socioeconomic status. In the U.S., early childhood caries affects 2 to 20% of pre-school children. Despite the general appreciation for the magnitude of childhood dental problems and the role of dietary sugars in the development of caries, there are critical gaps in our knowledge regarding how best to characterize the cariogenicity of child diet, what aspects of child diet are most important in the development of caries, and how dental treatment influences subsequent dietary patterns. The proposed exploratory/developmental research makes use of a rich complement of dental and dietary data being collected prospectively on 900 children as part of project within the Northeast Center for Research to Evaluate and Eliminate Dental Disparities. Low-income predominantly non-white children ages 2 to 6 years are being studied at three time points over a 12-month period. Equal numbers of children with severe early childhood caries and caries-free control children have been enrolled. A cariogenicity classification system will be developed based on foods identified by 24-hour diet recall interview and food frequency questionnaire, and used to systematically develop and test a pediatric ""dietary cariogenicity index"" to represent total dietary cariogenicity based on both the physical form and timing of food consumed. Secondarily, we will explore comprehensively the impact of S-ECC on dietary patterns, and evaluate changes in dietary patterns and dietary cariogenicity following comprehensive dental treatment. Collectively, these activities will improve our ability to characterize child diets with methodology relevant for oral health, and to inform prevention efforts and our ability to intervene in children with early childhood caries. Project Narrative: Improved methodology for the study of oral health/nutrition linkages as well as better understanding of the associations between eating patterns and early childhood caries are urgently needed. Together these advances will support increasingly focused clinical research in prevention and treatment efforts aimed at early childhood caries, a condition which disproportionately impacts children of racial/ethnic minorities as well as those of lower socioeconomic status.          ",Severe Early Childhood Caries: Role of Dietary Cariogenicity and Eating Patterns,7535940,R21DE018119,"['Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Juice ', ' Divorce ', ' Dietary intake ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Low income ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' U-Series Cooperative Agreements ', ' Cooperative Agreements ', ' Data ', ' Dietary Factors ', ' Intake ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Observational Study ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Food ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Affect ', ' Natural History ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Hay fever ', ' pollenosis ', ' Seasonal Rhinitis ', ' Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal ', ' Hayfever ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Lesion ', ' teacher ', ' Fiber ', ' Dental ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Numbers ', ' Low Income Population ', ' sugar ', ' Measurement ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Parents ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Sleep ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dietary Sugars ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Attention ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' Awareness ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Food and Beverages ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Dietary Assessment ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities ', ' NCMHD ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' ']",NIDCR,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,R21,2008,205677,0.06831981677837137
"Community Oral Health Interventions Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of the proposed Community Oral Health Interventions Program (COHIP) is to develop and implement an integrated model for reducing oral health disparities. COHIP's vision, mission, and design framework were developed with direct input from community partners and the findings for the Detroit Dental Health Project (DDHP), a disparity research center funded by NIH. The DDHP has had a successful model for understanding the determinants of oral health disparities and has built a strong community and organizational foundations. The DDHP has produced so far over 19 refereed publications, 3 PhD dissertations, and 2 MSc theses. Moreover, the DDHP core leadership has managed during the last 6 years a complex research project focusing on families of low-income African-American children. The findings from the DDHP underscore the need for multi-level interventions. Following the Ottawa and Jakarta Declarations for health promotion, COHIP was designed to intervene on key social, behavioral, and clinical factors of oral health disparities. The COHIP will focus on building healthy communities around four dental clinics owned by 2 Federally Qualified Health Centers. Around each clinic the lowest income census tracts will be selected to target a population of 16,023 children aged 0-11 years and their caregivers. The selected areas will be stratified into small clusters of households and randomized into intervention and comparison groups. COHIP includes three clustered randomized demonstration trials targeting the same families. One project will aim to intervene on the social, behavioral, and biological determinants of dental caries; another will focus on resolving a major problem identified in the DDHP analyses where children who get care have a significant proportion of their cavitated tooth surfaces left untreated within 2 years of follow-up; and the third will focus on reducing the significant disparities in periodontal diseases on adults by intervening on the social, behavioral, and biological risk factors of periodontal diseases. COHIP has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of social, behavioral, biological, dental, medical and organizational researchers. COHIP plans to intervene at the community and clinical levels. Sustainability of the COHIP model is a requirement demanded by the community partners. COHIP is collaborating with FQHC operational experts and has the support of HRSA regional office, University of Michigan ($1 Million grant), and the NNHOA.     ",Community Oral Health Interventions Program,7532990,U01DE019258,[''],NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2008,550000,0.29303359632721904
"Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health will focus on oral health concerns of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) and will be known as the Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR). The Principal Investigator is Judith E. N. Albino, PhD, President Emeritus of the University of Colorado and Professor, American Indian/Alaska Native Programs (AIANP) and Craniofacial Biology, and a health psychologist. She will lead the Research Program Administrative Center (RPAC). Dr. Spero Manson, PhD, Professor and Head, AIANP, and a medical anthropologist, will serve as Co-Investigator and lead the Community Liaison and Dissemination Core within RPAC. Biostatistician William Henderson, PhD, Professor, Colorado Health Outcomes Program, will lead the Statistics and Data Coordinating Center (S&DCC). CNOHR takes a comprehensive approach to oral health disparities in the long term, with an initial focus on oral infections and key roles of behavioral factors and comorbidities. The interdisciplinary team includes scientists trained in anthropology, biostatistics, dentistry, economics, medicine, psychology, and public health, supported by experienced project management and technology teams. The three initial projects focus on caries and periodontal disease, and intervene by extending current services and their use as well as adding prevention services and oral health promotion. The first Research Component (RC1) tests an intervention with pregnant women/mothers of newborns on a Northern Plains Reservation, which is focused on the use of motivational interviewing in prevention of ECC. RC2 is a randomized clinical trial of two methods for treating periodontal disease in Southwestern American Indians who also have Type 2 diabetes mellitus. RC3 is a test of a service delivery intervention in which tribal/community members are trained to apply fluoride varnish and deliver personalized oral health education for 3-5 year old children and their parents enrolled in reservation-based Indian Head Start programs. A Developmental Research Program will offer opportunities to pilot work suggested by new investigators, by community participation and planning activities, and by preliminary results of major projects. A focus on dissemination will include activities aimed at increasing community awareness and influencing health policy. Considerable prior experience with the participating tribes and communities has shaped the CNOHR methods and approaches, and ongoing community participation in planning will continue to influence the implementation of the RCs. A robust program of training and career development experiences will include mentoring and support for students at the secondary, undergraduate, professional and graduate, and post-doctoral levels, with emphasis on recruiting AI/AN investigators to oral health disparities research.     ",Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR),7533005,U54DE019259,[''],NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,U54,2008,2112432,0.273548267273214
"Public Health Nurses as Oral Health Advocates:  A Feasibility Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has been well documented that a mother's oral health status is directly related to the oral health of her children, especially during the perinatal period. This association is complex, with maternal oral health status as well as maternal knowledge, attitudes and health behaviors all affecting the child's oral health. Early childhood caries (ECC), an infectious, chronic disease most commonly transmitted from mother to child, is a prime example of the maternal-child link. The earlier a child is infected with Mutans Streptococcus (MS), the bacteria primarily associated with dental caries, the greater the child's risk of developing dental caries. Mothers who have poorer oral health, especially the presence of untreated dental decay, are more likely to have higher rates of MS, more likely to infect their child and more likely to infect their child at an earlier age. Home visiting programs were specifically developed to reach underserved; at risk children and annually over 1 million children are estimated to receive health care in their homes. The home visiting model offers an ideal venue to incorporate oral health promotion activities aimed at reducing ECC prevalence since 1) these programs already target children at highest risk for dental disease, 2) health promotion is one of their primary aims, 3) health professionals provide preventive services and 4) home-based health care providers have less time constraints than clinic based providers. Building on the tenets of the chronic care model, this exploratory study is designed to assess the feasibility of public health nurses incorporating oral health promotion activities into an ongoing pre and post natal home visiting program. The specific aims include: 1) to determine if an oral health promotion model, with a focus on patient-centered counseling and ECC prevention, can be effectively delivered by nurses as part of an ongoing perinatal home visiting program; 2) to determine nurses' ability to accurately assess oral health status, in a home setting, and 3) to determine patient acceptance of oral health promotion being delivered by nurses. The long term goal of this study is to use these results to design and test a multifaceted intervention to prevent ECC that incorporates both patient centered counseling and fluoride varnish applications in a home visiting setting. Using this delivery strategy to address the oral health needs of high risk women and children, when replicated in other settings, could potentially have far reaching impact in eliminating oral disease and oral health disparities.          ",Public Health Nurses as Oral Health Advocates:  A Feasibility Study,7487006,R21DE018654,"['Counseling ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Advocate ', ' Rate ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Perinatal ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' House Call ', ' Home Visits ', ' Link ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', ' Mothers ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Nurses ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Public Health Nurses ', ' Public Health Nursing ', ' Risk ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Streptococcus mutans ', ' S.mutans ', ' S. mutans ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tooth Diseases ', ' dental disorder ', ' dental disease ', ' Tooth Disorder ', ' Attitude ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Bacteria ', ' Services ', ' early childhood ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Home visitation ', ' home visit ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Prevalence ', ' chronic care model ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' ']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2008,200891,0.32226459060032625
"Oral Health in People with Systemic Sclerosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of our proposed research is to understand the oral health status, oral health- related behaviors, and quality of life in the US population of patients with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma or SSc). SSc is a rare, progressive connective tissue disease that affects predominately women (3.8:1) with a higher risk of the severe form among African-Americans. SSc adults experience manifestations of the systemic disease that include microstomia, xerostomia, and impaired manual dexterity. The two specific aims of this study are: 1) to characterize the oral health status of adults with SSc, and 2) to determine the SSc disease specific manifestations (microstomia, xerostomia, and manual dexterity impairments) that are associated with the severity of oral health problems and oral health-related quality of life among adults with SSc. This first study of US adults with SSc is a cross-sectional survey of 250 adults with SSc in South Carolina. This population is 25% African-American which is similar to the racial distribution of SSc in the US adult population. Data collection includes information on: oral health status (periodontal, dental, mucosal and microbial), oral manifestations of SSc (size of oral aperture, severity of oral dryness, and manual dexterity for oral hygiene), and oral health-related behaviors and quality of life. The oral health status of the South Carolina SSc population will be compared to that of the adult US population based on an analysis of corresponding measures using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002 data. Multivariable regression modeling will be used to evaluate hypothesized risk and protective factors that are associated with oral health status in adults with SSc. Results of this study in South Carolina will be used in regional efforts for the development of interventions for improved oral health status of adults with SSc. Second, these results will provide the basis for a larger US study of oral health problems of adults with SSc. The public health impact of this study will be the application of the greater understanding of the oral health status, oral health related behaviors, and quality of life of patients with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma or SSc). It is hoped that risks and protective factors can be identified to be associated with the oral health status of adults with systemic sclerosis, leading to the development of interventions for improved oral health in this population, and providing the basis for a larger study of oral health problems of adults with systemic sclerosis.          ",Oral Health in People with Systemic Sclerosis,7460896,R21DE017360,"['design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' Microbe ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Connective Tissue Diseases ', ' Connective Tissue Disorder ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Facilities ', ' dental health care facility ', ' Dental Staff ', ' dental personnel ', ' Scleroderma ', ' dermatosclerosis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Dryness ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Subgroup ', ' Centers of Research Excellence ', ' Center of Biomedical Research Excellence ', ' COBRE ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' Exhibits ', ' Behavioral ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Dental Insurance ', ' dental health insurance ', ' Periodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontia insurance ', ' Oral Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Surgery Insurance ', ' Ensure ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Dental ', ' Literature ', ' Living Wills ', ' living will ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Manuals ', ' Microstomia ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Respondent ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Oral Manifestations ', ' Patients ', ' Periodontal Diseases ', ' periodontium disorder ', ' periodontium disease ', ' periodontal disorder ', ' Parodontosis ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Systemic Scleroderma ', ' progressive systemic sclerosis ', ' Systemic Sclerosis ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' South Carolina ', ' Time ', ' Tooth structure ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Xerostomia ', ' dry mouth ', ' aptyalism ', ' Mouth Dryness ', ' Hyposalivation ', ' Asialia ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Severities ', ' Oral ', ' Systemic disease ', ' size ', ' Behavior ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' craniofacial ', ' craniofacies ', ' experience ', ' microbial ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Disease regression ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' health related quality of life ', ' ']",NIDCR,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2008,216591,0.325876573871514
"Oral Health Disparities in Publicly Insured Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for a NIH Career Award through the Faculty Transition Phase of the NIDCR Scholar Development and Faculty Transition Award. This application proposes a comprehensive interdisciplinary program of necessary training and mentorship to develop into an independent investigator. The applicant has an established record of commitment and interest in research and academic dentistry. Problem: There are significant disparities in access to dental care in this country, particularly for low-income children and those with special health care needs. Purpose: This project investigates disparities in access to dental care and pediatric performance measures of oral health care provided to children (1-18 years) enrolled in public insurance programs that currently exist in North Carolina and Virginia. Methods: North Carolina's (NC) public insurance dental plans (Medicaid/SCHIP) are administered as fee-for-service programs, while Virginia's (VA) publicly insured children are enrolled in both managed care organizations and fee-for-service dental programs. This project will examine the impact of health care organizational factors such as managed care versus fee-for-service programs and the difference in plan performance measures on pediatric oral health outcomes. Aims: The first study will describe the dynamics of enrollment and the access to dental services over a three-year period (2001-2003) of publicly insured children in both states. The second study will examine the performance of dental plans (utilization, effectiveness of prevention and quality) for children over this three-year period. The third study will examine the likelihood of hospital use versus the conventional dental setting for enrolled children 1-5 years of age. The fourth study is a feasibility project aimed at exploring the clinical implications of oral health case management in the medical arena.

"Oral/Pharyngeal Cancer Incidence from Medicare Claims    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral and pharyngeal cancer has remained a persistent oral health problem among the elderly in the United States. Survival rates have shown little improvement over the past decades. Health disparities also exist such as higher incidence and lower survival among racial and ethnic minority populations. Baseline and trend data by which progress can be measured are lacking-particularly among the underserved populations most in need of intervention. The goals of this research are to derive and validate an algorithm based on Medicare claims to identify incident oral and pharyngeal cancer cases among Medicare beneficiaries. This algorithm will be derived using the Surveillence, Epidimiology and End Result (SEER)-Medicare linked database. These data provide a unique linkage of the SEER tumor registry with Medicare claims, ie, it combines the ""gold standard"" tumor registry with the health claims of the largest insurer of the elderly in the United States. Half of the data will be randomly allocated to determine the algorithm, and the other have will be used for validation. This algorithm will have broad applications that include generating and improving upon oral and pharyngeal cancer baseline and trend data, which the National Institutes of Dental and Craniofacial Research have noted are lacking. This algorithm will also allow future studies to link cancer diagnoses with Medicare claims to study of prevention, early detection and treatment of oral and pharyngeal cancer. The strength in numbers of this population-based study, including racial and ethnic minority popuations, make this research a useful first step toward improving the oral health of the elderly as well as reducing health disparities. For this study, we will use Medicare claims to determine the best combination of procedures and diagnoses that identify individuals with oral and pharyngeal cancer. The ability to identify these cancer cases from Medicare claims will facilitate a cost-effective way to accurately measure the burden of oral and pharyngeal cancer, and to investigate the effectiveness of prevention, early detection and treatment strategies for this debilitating disease.           ",Oral/Pharyngeal Cancer Incidence from Medicare Claims,7430475,R03DE016958,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Rate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pharynx ', ' Pharynx Cancer ', ' Pharyngeal Cancer ', ' Pharnyx Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Pharynx ', ' Malignant Pharyngeal Tumor ', ' Malignant Pharyngeal Neoplasm ', ' beneficiary ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Au element ', ' Aging ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Algorithms ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' African ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Marital Status ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Societies ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Oropharyngeal ', ' oral pharyngeal ', ' Oropharynxs ', ' Oropharynx ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' craniofacial ', ' craniofacies ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' member ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Sampling ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' cost ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' Coupling ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' tumor ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2008,145383,0.13108992537614314
"Ten Year Longitudinal Analyses/Risk for Dental Caries in HIV Seropositive Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well-established that dental caries (dental decay), one the most prevalent diseases in the United States, tends to disproportionably affect racial and ethnic minorities, and those who are economically and socially disadvantaged, and those with underlying medical problems. HIV+ persons are likely to be ethnic/racial minorities and are likely to be socio-economically disadvantaged, compared to HIV- persons. A recent 5-year investigation found that HIV infection was related to dental caries, but reasons for the disparity were unclear, and, perhaps most importantly, risk factors for caries within the HIV+ persons were not well defined as a result of this study. The objective of this proposed investigation is to clarify the relationship between HIV infection and dental caries. The Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) and its oral sub-study (WIHS-OS) represent one of the largest studied cohorts of HIV+ persons in the United States, and provide the largest collection medical, interview and dental data of HIV+ persons followed for an extended period of time, beginning in 1995 and ending only recently (November, 2004). As part of the WIHS-OS, 844, primarily minority, women (719 HIV+, 125 HIV-) were recruited from the parent WIHS core in 1995-96; in 2001/02, in order to investigate the effects of HIV medications on a variety of outcomes, an additional 173 HIV+ women were added, for a total of 1017 women. Participants had interviews, medical and dental exams every six months. We propose to examine, using standard and appropriate statistical methodologies, using the WIHS and the WIHS-OS, whether demographic factors (income, education, race/ethnicity, drug use), behavioral factors (smoking, illicit drug use, use of dental services and oral self-care), HIV disease severity, HIV medication use, and oral health factors (saliva, oral hygiene and gum disease) are related to the development of caries over ten years. These proposed analyses are different from analyses that have been previously done because they will include data collected over the entire 10-year period of observation, from all women in the WIHS-OS and because they will include analysis of factors that have not previously been examined in this group. These analyses provide the best opportunity to resolve currently unanswered questions regarding the nature of caries in HIV+ persons, given the size of the database, the long, prospective nature of the follow-up for dental caries, and the high quality of the data. The results of these analyses will provide greatly needed clinical, practical, and public health information to dental and medical providers, as well as to those persons and agencies that are indebted to caring for the medical, dental and social welfare of persons with HIV infection. Recent studies have found that HIV infection may predispose persons to the development of dental decay (caries) due to side effects from medications and because of health damaging and health promoting behaviors in HIV+ persons. This proposed study is relevant because will resolve currently unanswered questions regarding the nature of caries in HIV+ persons. The results of these analyses will provide greatly needed clinical, practical, and public health information to dental and medical providers, as well as to those persons and agencies that are indebted to caring for the medical, dental and social welfare of persons with HIV infection.          ",Ten Year Longitudinal Analyses/Risk for Dental Caries in HIV Seropositive Women,7391312,R03DE018375,"['Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Provider ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Preventive ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Rate ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Root Caries ', ' Affect ', ' Secondary to ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Gingival Recession ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' patient home care ', ' patient homecare ', ' Home Care ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Interview ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Data Quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Matched Group ', ' Methamphetamine ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Benzeneethanamine, N,alpha-dimethyl-, (S)- ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Persons ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Saliva ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Welfare ', ' welfare ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Time ', ' Tooth Diseases ', ' dental disorder ', ' dental disease ', ' Tooth Disorder ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' United States ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Oral ', ' Salivary ', ' Pattern ', ' size ', ' Behavior ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Services ', ' Participant ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' CD4/CD8 ratio procedure ', ' T4-T8 Ratio ', ' CD4-CD8 Ratio ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' response ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HAART ', ' Cocaine ', ' 8-Azabicyclo(3.2.1)octane-2-carboxylic acid, 3-(benzoyloxy)-8-methyl-, methyl ester, (1R-(exo,exo))- ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Accounting ', ' oral HIV ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' ']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R03,2008,76050,0.1713881183012993
"Rural Older Adults: Oral Health, Diet & Quality of Life DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral health is central to physical and psychosocial well-being. Oral health deficits affect nutritional status through constraining dietary choices, and they can impair social interaction and integration due to pain, communication disorders, and embarrassment. While advances in preventive dentistry over the past half century have been dramatic, disparities in oral health continue to exist. Older rural adults are a particularly high risk population for oral health disparities; many have had limited access to oral health care services, high poverty rates and low socioeconomic status which place them at risk for oral health deficits relative to their urban and suburban counterparts. The high proportion of ethnic minorities among rural elders in some parts of the US makes disparities in oral health status within rural populations likely. This competing continuation application (R01 AG13469), which builds on eight years of community-based research on nutritional self-management and nutritional status in two rural, multi-ethnic North Carolina counties, has the overall goal of documenting the impact of oral health on multiple domains of life for rural adults > 60 years by accomplishing four specific aims: (1) to document the oral health status of older rural adults in a multi-ethnic population, and its association with gender, ethnicity, and other demographic predictors; (2) to delineate the nutritional impact of deficits in oral health, including food selection, food preparation, food consumption, nutrient intake, and nutritional status; (3) to document the relationship of oral health to social functioning, including communication and social interaction; and (4) to assess the impact of oral health on perceived well-being/quality of life (QoL, directly and as mediated by dietary intake and social functioning. Building on a foundation of community ethnography begun in 1996, this project will achieve its specific aims using a multi-method approach that integrates the results of qualitative research with older adults (in-depth interviews with 36 older adults experiencing oral health deficits) with a cross-sectional random epidemiological survey (n=750) and clinical examination (dentate only, n=450) of oral health and its consequences for nutritional status and quality of life among a tri-ethnic (African American, Native American and white) largely disadvantaged population of older adults.

"MEASURING & DOCUMENTING DISPARITIES IN ORAL HEALTH: A PRACTICAL APPROACH    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While some improvements in the health of the United States (US) population have occurred over time, the persistence of disparities between groups, namely racial/ethnic or socioeconomic groups, indicates that such improvement has been uneven. Although these disparities have been documented over the years and some studies have attempted to examine trends over time, it has been challenging to estimate the magnitude and direction of these disparities across groups due to the lack of a uniform or standard methodology to measure health disparities and their trends across time. Oral health disparities are not an exception to this challenge. The goal of this proposal is to develop and test a methodology to assess oral health disparities in dental caries and periodontal diseases across populations over time. In order to accomplish this goal, we propose the following two specific aims: Aim 1: Use data from NHANES III to develop sensitive methods to measure disparities in dental caries and periodontal disease in the US population accounting for the difference in case definitions across studies. These methods will be developed considering and accounting for: a) the distribution of disease in the population by age, gender, race/ethnicity and socioeconomic position (SEP) indicators; b) the selection of the best reference group; and c) the comparison of results obtained using relative versus absolute measures of disease. Aim 2: Use data from NHANES 1999-2002 to test the measures developed in Aim 1 to assess oral health disparities in dental caries and periodontal disease. Testing the validity and reliability of the developed methodology in Aim 1 using the NHANES 1999-2002 data will allow us to provide guidelines and recommendations for the use of uniform and standardized measures to document the existing oral health disparities in studies at the local and national levels across groups of the population over time. This proposal's aims are consistent with the NIDCR Strategic Plan's Crosscutting Areas-Health Disparities and Data acquisition and Analysis-and the Healthy People 2010's goal of eliminating health disparities among segment of the US population. Specifically, accomplishing this proposed study's aims has the potential to contribute to our understanding of oral health disparities in the US; to provide the tools to gauge the magnitude and direction of oral health disparities using uniform measures in studies at the local and national levels; and to recommend guidelines for oral health disparity comparisons across studies and populations over time. Finally, the developed measures have the potential to be used to measure health disparities related to age, gender, race/ethnicity and socioeconomic position on other oral health outcomes and health outcomes in general.           ",MEASURING & DOCUMENTING DISPARITIES IN ORAL HEALTH: A PRACTICAL APPROACH,7436320,R03DE017901,"['Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Population Group ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' trend ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Guidelines ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Periodontal Diseases ', ' periodontium disorder ', ' periodontium disease ', ' periodontal disorder ', ' Parodontosis ', ' Periodontal Index ', ' tool ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Accounting ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' data acquisition ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NIDCR,HERBERT H.

"Dental Caries: Whole Genome Association and Gene x Environment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dental caries (also known as tooth decay) remains the most common chronic disease of childhood. Although overall caries prevalence has declined over the last 40 years, dental caries in the primary dentition and mean caries rates in children ages 2-11 has increased markedly over the past 12 years. Childhood caries is a serious public health issue because of associated health problems and because disparities in oral health have led to substantially higher average disease prevalence among children in poverty and in underserved racial and ethnic groups. These issues are of such concern that in 2005, the American Academy of Pediatrics made children's oral health one of their top areas of focus, as it is for the majority of the NIDCR ""Disparities Centers."" Multiple factors contribute to a person's risk for caries, including environmental factors such as diet, oral hygiene, fluoride exposure and the level of colonization of cariogenic bacteria and host factors such as salivary flow. There are still individuals who appear to be more susceptible to caries and those that are extremely resistant, regardless of the environmental risk factors to which they are exposed, implying that genetic factors also play an important role in caries etiology. This conclusion is supported by studies in both humans and animals, with the most compelling evidence coming from studies of twins reared apart in which investigators found significant resemblance within monozygotic (MZ) but not dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs for percentage of teeth and surfaces restored or carious and estimated the genetic contribution to caries as 40%. Despite the strong evidence of a genetic component to risk for dental caries, there have been only a few studies of candidate genes in caries, and no published genome-wide scans. Therefore, the goal of this study is to perform genome-wide association (GWA) studies of dental caries with a large panel of SNPs (500,000 or more) in families and individuals ascertained through multiple US sites. There will be an initial GWA scan in samples from three sites (University of Pittsburgh, University of Iowa, and University of Washington), with follow-up studies in additional collaborating sites (University of Michigan and UCSF). Successful completion of this study will allow a better understanding of the biology of dental caries, and will lead to earlier identification of children at risk for dental caries, thereby allowing improved and targeted interventions.             ",Dental Caries: Whole Genome Association and Gene x Environment Studies,7478820,U01DE018903,"['Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Enamel ', ' tooth enamel ', ' Enamel ', ' Diet ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Range ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Exhibits ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Fluorides ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Depth ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Phase ', ' Iowa ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Michigan ', ' Persons ', ' Twin Studies ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Host Factor ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Animals ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' programs ', ' Time ', ' Tooth structure ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Dizygotic Twins ', ' Fraternal Twins ', ' Universities ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Washington ', ' Salivary ', ' tooth surface ', ' Biology ', ' American ', ' early childhood ', ' Buffers ', ' California ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Primary Dentition ', ' Deciduous Dentition ', ' Gender ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Early identification ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Academy ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' cariogenic bacteria ', ' SNP genotyping ', ' Prevalence ', ' Heritability ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' environmental allergy ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2008,851689,0.20563174192481917
"Examining California's Oral Health Disparities: New Models and Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 2005 California Oral Health Needs Assessment of Children (COHNAC), a complex statewide health examination survey of over 21,000 kindergarten and third grade children, has shown decreases in the prevalence of untreated caries and slight decreases in caries experience since the 1993-4 COHNAC. However, these prevalences have not met Healthy People 2010 Objectives, California's children have the 2nd worst oral health of the 25 states reporting data, and children in families with low income and children of color continue to have worse oral health. Overall goals of this proposed project are to apply state-of-the-art HD methods in the 2005 COHNAC, to assess associations of some particular factors of acculturation, parental health literacy, and social environment in relation to oral health, to test and evaluate HD methods applied to oral health, and to provide a suite of methods/tools to colleagues that can be used in similar state oral health surveys and beyond. Specific Aims are: 1) To estimate oral health disparities (OHD) with traditional regression based measures as well as state-of-the art disparities measures (e.g. HCI and Thiel's index) in the 2005 statewide California Oral Health Needs Assessment of Children; 2) To use multiple imputation for missing questionnaire data and models to examine child, family, neighborhood and school factors (including acculturation and health literacy related measures) associated with California OHD; 3) To validate a multi-level ensemble statistical modeling approach combining recursive partitioning methods with complex survey sampling regression using computer simulations; and 4) To disseminate a) multiple imputed 2005 COHNAC data according to the UCSF CAN-DO data use policy and b) computer programs and documentation for HD indices and survey regression portion of ensemble models freely on the UCSF CAN-DO website. An overarching goal for HP 2010 is the elimination or reduction of health disparities (HDs) in the US population.

"Alkali production in human dental plaque and saliva as predictor of caries risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Caries continues to be a prevalent disease with high incidence among all age groups. Ammonia production from the hydrolysis of arginine and urea by enzymes of oral bacteria moderates plaque acidification and may inhibit dental caries, as suggested by in vitro studies and indirect clinical observations. The objective of this study is to examine the relationship of arginine deiminase (AD) and urease activities with dental caries status at the clinical level. We hypothesize that AD and urease activities in plaque and/or saliva of caries free subjects is significantly higher than in caries active subjects. AD and urease activities will be measured in dental plaque and saliva samples from caries free subjects, caries experienced subjects, and subjects with at least 4 teeth with active caries. Specific Aim (SA) 1 will determine the magnitude and the direction of the association between plaque and saliva AD and urease activity levels with dental caries in human subjects. SA 2 will examine the relationship between AD and urease activity levels with the numbers of selected major acid-producing and alkali-producing bacterial species in the oral samples. SA 3 will investigate the predictors of AD and urease activity levels. SA 1 will be met through a case-control study and SA 2 will be met using a sub-sample of the subjects (10 with the highest, 10 with the lowest, and 10 with medium plaque AD and urease levels). SA3 will be met by gathering information on patient's age, gender, race, dental history, plaque, and frequency of oral care, and investigating the relationship of these explanatory factors to AD and urease activity levels in plaque and saliva. If the results of the present study support an association between AD and/or urease activity levels with dental caries in adults, the knowledge obtained will be applied to the design of a prospective cohort study at the end of the grant period, which will determine whether this association is a cause-and-effect one. If AD and urease activity levels are shown to be predictive of caries risk in adults, either alone or in combination with other risk factors, we will then apply this relationship to the development of novel approaches for early identification of individuals at risk to develop caries and for caries prevention strategies.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will contribute to the development of novel methods for caries risk assessment and prevention, while providing a better understanding of unknown factors affecting caries risk.           The proposed study will contribute to the development of novel methods for caries risk assessment and prevention, while providing a better understanding of unknown factors affecting caries risk.",Alkali production in human dental plaque and saliva as predictor of caries risk,7581196,R21DE018392,"['Measures ', ' Early identification ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Sampling ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' oral biofilm ', ' oral care ', ' oral streptococci ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' human subject ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Hydrolysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Alkalies ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Dental ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' enzyme activity ', ' Methods ', ' Ammonia ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Streptococcus salivarius ', ' S.salivarius ', ' S. salivarius ', ' Polymerase Chain Reaction ', ' Probability ', ' Production ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Streptococcus gordonii ', ' S.gordonii ', ' S. gordonii ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Saliva ', ' Societies ', ' Arginine ', ' L-Isomer Arginine ', ' L-Arginine ', ' Knowledge ', ' Streptococcus sanguis ', ' S.sanguis ', ' S. sanguis ', ' Time ', ' Tooth structure ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Urea ', ' Ureaphil ', ' Urea Carbamide ', ' Elaqua XX ', ' Carbamide ', ' Urease ', ' Urea Amidohydrolase ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Severities ', ' Oral ', ' Salivary ', ' Streptococcus parasanguis ', ' S.parasanguis ', ' S. parasanguis ', ' Source ', ' Bacteria ', ' Arginine deiminase ', ' arginine iminohydrolase ', ' arginine dihydrolase ', ' arginine converting enzyme ', ' information gathering ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' oral bacteria ', ' oral flora ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Prevention ', ' Catabolism ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Carbon Dioxide ', ' Carbonic Anhydride ', ' CO2 ', ' social ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' demineralization ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Cytoplasm ', ' Acids ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Enamel ', ' tooth enamel ', ' Enamel ', ' Dental Plaque ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Enzymes ', ' Alkalinization ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fermentation ', ' Killings ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' remineralization ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2008,219750,0.12016170614334734
"Northwest/Alaska/Hawaii Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Northwest/Alaska/Hawaii Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities at the University of Washington in Seattle focuses on tooth decay in children, because it is the major oral health challenge U.S. society faces. Tooth decay in preschool children is worsening. The Healthy People 2010 Midcourse Review found the country moving away from national targets for young children: 22% of children 2-4 years of age have tooth decay while the target is 11%. The research plan addresses disparities and inequities in access to dental care and to healthy teeth (tooth decay or caries prevention) for low-income and vulnerable mothers and children within a conceptual framework that specifies the ecological nature of disparity problems. The specific aims of the community-based multidisciplinary research plan are to: 1) Conduct human trials to evaluate the efficacy of interventions to prevent and treat dental caries in children and their caretakers; 2) Develop community-based research that translates existing knowledge and new information into technologies and interventions that will reduce disparities; and 3) Encourage and support developmental research that has the potential to lead to independent studies to address and reduce caries inequity in children. The Center includes the Research Program Administrative Center (RPAC), two major community based intervention trials focused on dental caries- Community-Based Intergenerational Oral Health Promotion In Rural America and Parent-Child Toothbrushing with 1000 ppm Fluoride Toothpaste to Prevent ECC-and a Statistics and Data Coordinating Center (S&DCC).

"Understanding Barriers to Oral Health Care In Pregnancy: The First Step to Improv    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral health diseases such as childhood caries and periodontal diseases are prevalent conditions that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and disadvantaged individuals. Dental caries is the most common chronic childhood disease, affecting 5 times more children than asthma. Caries leads to tooth loss, with subsequent nutritional and social consequences. Adult periodontal disease affects up to 40% of reproductive age women, and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia. Effective preventive and treatment measures to reduce the morbidity of caries and periodontal disease exist, and data suggest that treatment of maternal oral disease may improve the oral health of the offspring and reduce risk for adverse pregnancy outcome. However, despite the presence of these evidence-based interventions to prevent or reduce the burden of oral diseases among children and women, both caries and periodontal disease remain prevalent, particularly among low-income families and members of racial and ethnic minorities. Our long-term goal is to reduce morbidity of oral diseases among pregnant women and their children, and to eliminate disparities in oral health. We hypothesize that maternal knowledge about and attitudes toward oral health, as well as lack of access to oral health services, greatly affect maternal behaviors that promote the oral health of both the mother and her offspring. The primary objective of this study is to identify barriers to oral health care among pregnant women, particularly racial and ethic minorities and those of lower socio-economic status, and then develop intervention strategies for removing or lowering the barriers so that existing evidence-based interventions can be more effectively applied. We will pursue this objective by achieving the following specific aims: 1. Collect and analyze data to understand pregnant women's current practices, attitudes, and perceived system barriers regarding optimal dental health. 2. Test the feasibility, acceptability, and likely use of four to eight potential interventions to remove and/or reduce barriers and encourage improved oral health practices. 3. Conduct pilot study of one or more interventions developed in aim 2. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team with strength in oral health in pregnancy, public health programming, behavioral research, qualitative analysis and public policy. Findings from this research will provide the framework for development of innovative, culturally sensitive strategies and approaches to improve the health and well-being of mothers and their children by reducing barriers to oral health care. Oral health diseases are prevalent conditions that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and disadvantaged individuals.

"Molecular Analysis of the Biofilm in Caries and Health DESCRIPTION: Dental caries is the most common chronic disease of childhood, and is the biggest unmet health care need among America's children. Socioeconomic disparities in both rates of disease and treatment are a major public health issue. To date, effective biological interventions to prevent caries have not been developed. Dental plaque contains several hundred different organisms, many of which are poorly studied. A number of species have been shown to produce sufficient acid to drive pH below critical levels and to tolerate low pH. Research has primarily focused on Streptococcus mutans as the etiologic agent in caries, but based the work of previous investigators using cultivation and on our preliminary findings using molecular methods, S. mutans is not always present in caries, is often found at low levels, and additional and unexpected bacterial species may be important. In addition, comparatively little attention has been paid to identifying health-associated and potentially beneficial bacterial species that may reside in the oral cavity. For the proposed project, bacterial species present in childhood caries and health will be identified by cloning and sequencing bacterial 16S ribosomal genes amplified from DNA isolated from plaque samples. This open ended approach will allow the detection and identification of all bacterial species present, including novel, uncultivated or unexpected species. The presence and quantities of the species identified by this approach as potentially associated with caries or health will then be determined using quantitative, real-time PCR. This dual-technique approach will allow the examination of a much larger sample size than is possible by cloning and sequencing alone. Accomplishment of the proposed studies will identify the pathogens associated with the onset and progression of severe caries of the primary and young permanent dentition, and identify those bacterial species associated with a healthy dentition. This study will also provide a comprehensive catalog of the supragingival flora in children based on molecular technology. The significance of the proposed work is that identification of additional caries pathogens would provide alternative targets for biological interventions, and identification of beneficial health-associated species could provide the basis for therapeutic interventions to establish caries-resistant microbial communities.

"Oral Health Disparities Among High-Risk Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award for Monica Fisher, DDS, MS, MPH, PhD. This award would allow Dr. Fisher to meet her long-term career goal to conduct productive and innovative patient-oriented research that focuses on oral health disparities and treatment effectiveness among high-risk populations. An immediate career goal is to gain additional expertise relevant to research on oral health disparities among high-risk populations.      We propose 3 aims related to career development and 4 related to the research plan. Dr. Fisher's career development aims are to: (1) obtain advanced biostatistical training; (2) increase analytical expertise in the areas of treatment effectiveness and smoking as a major risk factor for oral disease and its systemic effects; and (3) use these findings as preliminary data for subsequent R03 and R01 grant applications. The Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health highlights the imperative for rigorous studies on oral health disparities in high-risk populations, studies on smoking as a major risk factor, and studies on linkages between oral and general health. Therefore, the research plan comprises investigations of oral health disparities among high-risk populations (data from the Florida Dental Care Study) and persons with systemic conditions (data from the third National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey). The specific aims of the research plan are to test hypotheses that among highrisk populations: (4) dental care is effective in facilitating recovery and preventing oral health-related quality of life decrements, but varies by race and socioeconomic status (SES); (5) dental care is effective in facilitating recovery and preventing oral diseases, but varies by race and SES; (6) periodontal disease is associated with heart disease and glycemic control in diabetics, in analyses restricted to non-smokers; (7) self-reported need for a dental cleaning is associated with heart disease and glycemic control in diabetics, in analyses restricted to non-smokers.  This activity will take place in highly supportive research environments. Co-mentors Gregg Gilbert, DDS, MBA, Mark Litaker, PhD, and George Taylor, DMD, DrPH, national experts in their fields, will supervise Dr. Fisher's research and career development. The proposed plans will intensify and focus Dr. Fisher's career development, and make innovative, methodologically sophisticated contributions to the literature.

"Longitudinal Study of Dental Caries in VLBW Infants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This longitudinal study addresses the relationship between birth weight and early childhood caries (ECC) in a cohort of pre-term very low birth weight (VLBW) and full-term normal birth weight (NBW) infants. VLBW and ECC disproportionately affects poor and minority children costing Medicaid billions of dollars annually for treatment. The improved survival of VLBW children has resulted in greater long-term disabilities and need for health services, thus classifying them as children with special health care needs. The oral health needs of VLBW children have not been adequately studied. VLBW children are known to have a high prevalence of enamel defects in the primary dentition, which in turn can lead to increased susceptibility to ECC. Socio- behavioral factors that can predispose some children to ECC are unknown in VLBW children. Therefore the primary aims of the study are to (1) assess the incidence of ECC in VLBW and NBW infants; (2) assess mediators such as the incidence of developmental enamel defects, S.mutans infection and the extent of oral health behaviors in VLBW and NEW infants; (3) assess the indirect relationship between birth weight and ECC via mediators after controlling for independent moderating variables. A total of 200 VLBW and 200 NBW infants will be followed at 8 and 18-20 months corrected age. The proposed study will collect data on caries (decayed and filled surfaces), mediating biological variables (enamel hypoplasia and opacity, S.mutans levels) and infant oral health behavior (feeding, diet, oral hygiene practices, and dental access), and independent variables (demographics, parent predisposing, enabling, need characteristics, dental behavior, biological and child medical factors). Data analysis for testing aims 1 and 2 includes the generalized estimating equations (GEE) models, and a two-stage structural equations model (SEM) for testing the role of mediators in aim 3. The sample size provide 85 to 99% power to compare the two groups in terms of the three study aims. The results of this study will provide critical data to address the knowledge gaps in taking care of VLBW children. The clinical implications include primary prevention, early diagnosis and treatment to prevent further susceptibility to dental decay. It is also of public health interest since interventions to target knowledge, attitude, beliefs, and oral health practices can be implemented in programs for special needs children, and there by improve both oral and systemic health.           ",Longitudinal Study of Dental Caries in VLBW Infants,7455129,R01DE017947,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Enamel ', ' tooth enamel ', ' Enamel ', ' Dental Enamel Hypoplasia ', ' Hypoplastic Enamel ', ' Enamel Hypoplasia ', ' Enamel Agenesis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diet ', ' Purpose ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Older Population ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Affect ', ' Dental General Practice ', ' dental practice ', ' Age ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Needs ', ' Alaska ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Survivors ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Infection ', ' Dental Insurance ', ' dental health insurance ', ' Periodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontia insurance ', ' Oral Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Surgery Insurance ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Dental ', ' disability ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Numbers ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Sample Size ', ' Perinatal Care ', ' Medicaid ', ' Medicine ', ' Collaborations ', ' Very Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' very low birth weight infant human ', ' very low birth weight ', ' VLBW (human) ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Dental Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Streptococcus mutans ', ' S.mutans ', ' S. mutans ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Washington ', ' Oral ', ' Live Birth ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' interest ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Equation ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' early childhood ', ' mental development ', ' cohort ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Reporting ', ' Primary Dentition ', ' Deciduous Dentition ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' cost ', ' feeding ', ' Minority ', ' demographics ', ' ']",NIDCR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,421614,0.19483193891418546
"Oral Health of Latino and Ethiopian Children and Their Mothers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract With the launch of Healthy People 2010 and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) strategic plan; goals to eliminate disparities in health and health care have been firmly placed on the national health agenda. To achieve these goals, the Institute of Medicine's Unequal Treatment report recommended that DHHS monitor progress toward the elimination of health care disparities. The report noted the relative paucity of research in health care disparities for non-African American minority groups. Dental caries and its complications are specifically targeted by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research's Plan to Eliminate Health Disparities. Despite significant advances in the understanding of the caries process and in the tools to prevent it, caries is still the most prevalent infectious disease among children, particularly minority and low-income children. Caries in preschool children, also known as Early Childhood Caries, is of particular concern given that its deleterious effects are seen later in life and its treatment requires specialized care even in the operating room under general anesthesia. Early Childhood Caries is the presence of 1 or more decayed (noncavitated or cavitated lesions), missing (due to caries), or filled tooth surfaces in any primary tooth in a child 71 months of age or younger. The overall goal of this mixed-method, community based participatory research project is to improve understanding of early childhood caries and barriers and facilitators for dental care services utilization among Latino and Ethiopian children and their mothers. There are four main aims of this project: 1) Identify knowledge, attitudes and behaviors relating to oral health among mothers who are main caregivers of 0-5 year old Latino and Ethiopian children attending an urban community health center, (2) Compare demographic and sociocultural characteristics of users and nonusers of dental services at an urban community health center, (3) Determine the rate of caries and risk markers (identified in Aims 1 and 2) for Latino, Ethiopian and other children 0-5 years of age and their main caregiver mothers who receive dental services, and (4) Provide train- the-trainer oral health education for personnel of an urban community health center. This project will provide needed information regarding oral health of Central/South American and Ethiopian immigrants, parents' attitudes and beliefs towards dental pain in young children, and maternal oral health knowledge, beliefs and attitudes. Information gained through this collaborative project will be used to plan oral health education efforts at a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) in Washington DC (Mary's Center for Maternal and Child Care), and other Central/South American and Ethiopian communities outside the DC area and support ancillary oral health studies for the NHLBI Hispanic Community Health Study, and a clinical trial planning grant. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Information on dental caries (the most common infectious disease among children); the use of dental services; and oral health knowledge, attitudes and behaviors will be gathered through focus groups, health interview surveys and dental examinations for 0-5 year old Latino and Ethiopian children and their main caregiver mothers attending an urban community health center. This information will be used to provide education on oral health to personnel of an urban community health center.          ",Oral Health of Latino and Ethiopian Children and Their Mothers,7425196,R21HD060294,"['Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Dental Health Surveys ', ' dental survey ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early childhood caries (ECC) is the most prevalent chronic childhood disease in the U.S., particularly among economically disadvantaged, underserved children. We propose to continue our existing Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health (U54DE014251) and its efforts to understand, prevent, and reduce oral health disparities, with a focus on preventing ECC. The themes of our collaborative, community-based program are (1) to provide the high-quality evidence base for new methods to prevent ECC in populations experiencing oral-health disparities and (2) to identify the most effective dissemination methods for delivering fluoride varnish (FV), an efficacious preventive method. We will actively engage California communities and providers in two large-scale intervention studies utilizing randomized clinical trial (RCT) methodology, stratified by settings, to assess the effectiveness or clinical efficacy of different preventive methods on caries incidence and increment among low-income children. Using the RE-AIM framework, Project 1 will identify the most effective setting (medical, social service agency or dental) to disseminate FV to the greatest number of 1-3-year-old children. Stratifying on setting, a parallel groups practical RCT will be conducted in 24 community-based primary care clinics (CPCCs) from the UCSF primary care collaborative research network, and 24 California Special Supplemental Nutrition Programs for Women, Infants and Children (WICs). Each non-dental site (CPCC or WIC) will be randomized to a program of parental counseling and onsite FV application or to parental counseling and referral to a dentist for child's FV application. We will also compare two automated telephone counseling methods and utilize teledentistry approaches for blinded caries assessments. Project 2 is an intervention study to be conducted in dental and non-dental settings, both affiliated with Federally Qualified Health Centers near the US-Mexico border, to compare the relative caries prevention efficacy of four protocols in 3-6 year-old children: 1) parental oral-health counseling (C) alone; 2) C+ FV; 3) C+ fluoride-releasing, glass ionomer (Gl) sealants applied to primary molars, and 4) C+FV+ Gl. Our Administrative Core, Statistics and Data Coordinating Center, and Community Liaison Program will support our two RCTs and developmental projects. These endeavors, with other education and career development activities, will foster new investigators to increase oral-health-disparity research capacity.     ",Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health,7533540,U54DE019285,[''],NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U54,2008,3453750,0.2200410498739798
"Southeast Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A multi-disciplinary Center built on strong community partnerships is proposed at the University of Florida to foster research, dissemination of findings, and training on disparities in oral health. The initial theme of this Center is to reduce disparities in cancer survival by promoting early detection of oral and pharyngeal cancer (OPC) through two community-based theoretically-derived intervention projects. Community-based interventions built on strong theory are rare in oral health disparity research. A major strength of this application is the inclusion of an evidence base to support our research methodology. The first project will refine and upgrade health care providers' ability to detect early stages of OPC using evidence-based health education theory and the second will apply theoretically derived health promotion models to increase the likelihood that African American men obtain regular OPC screening exams. An R21-level project to validate a cellular biomarker related to susceptibility to squamous cell carcinoma is also proposed. The second theme of this Center is to apply community-based research principles gleaned from aforementioned work to follow-up projects that will address communities' oral health needs. One such R21-level developmental project will determine feasibility of conducting large scale preventive and treatment intervention in a well defined population of low-income minority children with aggressive periodontitis. It is expected that both R21-level projects will lead to full community-based interventions. This Center will facilitate oral health disparity research by 1) providing new resources through which multi-disciplinary teams jointly conduct targeted community-based intervention research; 2) strengthening the partnerships among researchers, clinicians, and the community; and 3) developing a pipeline of oral health disparity researchers and leaders. Our longstanding partnerships enable us to disseminate the results of our research such that we influence the dental/medical community, community members/patients, and policymakers alike. As proposed, the Center will produce a synergistic force resulting in a measurable reduction of disparities in oral health among the underserved. Community partners include the Alachua County Organization for Rural Needs (ACORN, a clinic to serve low-income rural and minority patients), Florida state dental organizations, Department of Health, faith-based community organizations (ACTION network and 4A's), and Florida A&M University, a historically Black College/University. The research conducted by the Southeast Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health (CRRDOH) will generate an evidence base that will affect public policy and will result in long term benefits for disadvantaged citizens.       ",Southeast Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health,7896980,U54DE019261,"['Critiques ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Dental Hygienists ', ' Dentistry ', ' Dentists ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Glean ', ' Population Group ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Continuance of education ', ' Continuing Education ', ' Professional Education ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' mouth lesion ', ' oral lesion ', ' Crossover Trials ', ' Crossover Studies ', ' Cross-Over Trials ', ' Cross-Over Studies ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Measurable ', ' Media Intervention ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Premalignant ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' Pharynx Cancer ', ' Pharyngeal Cancer ', ' Pharnyx Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Pharynx ', ' Malignant Pharyngeal Tumor ', ' Malignant Pharyngeal Neoplasm ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pharynx ', ' Faculty ', ' Behavioral ', ' Florida ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Affect ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Oral Health Disparities Among High-Risk Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award for Monica Fisher, DDS, MS, MPH, PhD. This award would allow Dr. Fisher to meet her long-term career goal to conduct productive and innovative patient-oriented research that focuses on oral health disparities and treatment effectiveness among high-risk populations. An immediate career goal is to gain additional expertise relevant to research on oral health disparities among high-risk populations.      We propose 3 aims related to career development and 4 related to the research plan. Dr. Fisher's career development aims are to: (1) obtain advanced biostatistical training; (2) increase analytical expertise in the areas of treatment effectiveness and smoking as a major risk factor for oral disease and its systemic effects; and (3) use these findings as preliminary data for subsequent R03 and R01 grant applications. The Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health highlights the imperative for rigorous studies on oral health disparities in high-risk populations, studies on smoking as a major risk factor, and studies on linkages between oral and general health. Therefore, the research plan comprises investigations of oral health disparities among high-risk populations (data from the Florida Dental Care Study) and persons with systemic conditions (data from the third National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey). The specific aims of the research plan are to test hypotheses that among highrisk populations: (4) dental care is effective in facilitating recovery and preventing oral health-related quality of life decrements, but varies by race and socioeconomic status (SES); (5) dental care is effective in facilitating recovery and preventing oral diseases, but varies by race and SES; (6) periodontal disease is associated with heart disease and glycemic control in diabetics, in analyses restricted to non-smokers; (7) self-reported need for a dental cleaning is associated with heart disease and glycemic control in diabetics, in analyses restricted to non-smokers.  This activity will take place in highly supportive research environments. Co-mentors Gregg Gilbert, DDS, MBA, Mark Litaker, PhD, and George Taylor, DMD, DrPH, national experts in their fields, will supervise Dr. Fisher's research and career development.

"University of Guam/Cancer Research Center of Hawaii Partnership (2 of 2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Oral cancer is the sixth leading cancer in the world, and ranks in the top three cancers in countries where betel nut (also known as areca nut) chewing is common. In Micronesia, a group of Pacific Islands where betel nut is frequently chewed, the risk of oral cancer is elevated, but quite variable across populations. For the period 1985-1998 (age-adjusted to the 1988 U.S. population), the prevalence per 100,000 ranged from 4.2 in Chuuk to 31.8 in Yap. In Guam, the incidence of mouth cancer per 100,000 population for the period 1997-2003, age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. population, varied between 8.1 for Chamorros to 17.9 among other Micronesians. The disparity in oral cancer rates among these populations may be due to differences in betel nut chewing patterns. To investigate the effect of chewing patterns, we must be able to conduct studies on multiple Micronesian islands with differing chewing patterns. Previously, we developed a comprehensive betel nut assessment protocol and a protocol for detecting oral lesions on Guam. The overall objectives of the pilot study are to further develop and test these methods, and to demonstrate that they can be applied in a research study of betel nut use on an island other than Guam. A convenience sample of 100 Micronesians (50 men and 50 women) who are long-term betel nut users (regular use for at least 10 years) will be recruited from the island of Saipan in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). We will collect data on betel nut use, presence of oral precancerous lesions, diet, demographics, anthropometry, medical history, and physical activity. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) collect information on betel nut use among study participants and other members of their families, 2) perform oral examinations, and biopsies, as needed, on study participants, 3) measure other health risks among this population, including obesity, high blood pressure, self-reported history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and unhealthy dietary practices and 4) examine associations of duration, frequency, and type of betel nut use with oral pre-cancers and with other health risks. This pilot project will help formulate the research methods for studying betel nut use and disease risk in Micronesia, and will provide the necessary preliminary data for a full multi-island study of betel nut use and the prevalence of oral lesions. Ultimately, a better understanding of these associations will provide important new directions for reduction of health risks through educational efforts and targeted intervention strategies.              ",University of Guam/Cancer Research Center of Hawaii Partnership (2 of 2),7786725,U54CA143728,[''],NCI,UNIVERSITY OF GUAM,U54,2009,1173406,0.2111930028514738
"Device for Tooth Cleaning in Special Needs and Older Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Good oral hygiene practices, such as brushing teeth regularly, are critical to maintaining dental and periodontal health. In special needs and older populations with reduced manual dexterity, brushing is not rigorous enough to maintain oral hygiene, leading to a higher incidence of caries and periodontal disease in these cohorts. Poor oral health not only affects nutritional and functional status adversely, it also has serious implications on quality of life with a potential increase in the susceptibility of these individuals to a number of systemic ailments. This provides the impetus to develop a novel, hands- free device for tooth cleaning, with the objective of improving oral and systemic health in special needs and older populations. In this proposal, we hypothesize that a novel hands-free ultrasound generating device coupled with specially formulated gels will be effective in removing dental biofilms in vitro. To test this hypothesis, we propose to: (1) Develop and test ultrasound-generating piezo-fiber based composite strips molded into a form that can be placed over the teeth and gums, in conjunction with gels that function to enhance the action of the ultrasound, and (2) Determine the efficacy of the device in cleaning of typodont and human teeth covered with an experimental biofilm in vitro as compared to conventional brushing. The scientific and technological novelty lies in developing and using specialized ultrasound strips combined with uniquely formulated gels placed adjacent to the teeth to achieve biofilm removal. The gels will serve to provide a medium for propagating ultrasonic pressure waves to tooth surfaces AND to reduce ultrasonic energies required to cause cavitations (microscopic bubbles) that then expand and contract rapidly next to tooth surfaces and serve to clean teeth. The rapid expansion and contraction of these microscopic bubbles provides the same energies as those generated by the motion of brushes against tooth surfaces and are expected to dislodge biofilm within a maximum of two minutes. A series of gels will be developed that will enhance the action of ultrasound and will function to clean and renew the tooth. We anticipate that a device will be developed which can be used to clean teeth in an effective manner and with results comparable to brushing. The development of this device has important public health implications, since it will improve oral and possibly systemic health in special needs and older populations, and may also reduce healthcare costs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Cleaning of teeth by regular brushing is extremely important towards maintaining oral health, which in turn can impact on overall health. Many older individuals and special needs populations lack the hand mobility to effectively clean their teeth, leading to oral and possibly systemic disease. This causes significant public health disparities in these populations. This application proposes the development and testing of a novel hands-free toothcleaning device, using ultrasound in association with specially formulated gels. The successful development of such a device will have a major public health impact by improving oral and general health of older individuals and those with special needs. Such improvements in oral and general health will also decrease healthcare costs to society.           Project Narrative Cleaning of teeth by regular brushing is extremely important towards maintaining oral health, which in turn can impact on overall health.

"Severe Early Childhood Caries: Role of Dietary Cariogenicity and Eating Patterns    Description (provided by applicant): Early childhood caries is a serious pediatric health problem that disproportionately impacts children of lower socioeconomic status. In the U.S., early childhood caries affects 2 to 20% of pre-school children. Despite the general appreciation for the magnitude of childhood dental problems and the role of dietary sugars in the development of caries, there are critical gaps in our knowledge regarding how best to characterize the cariogenicity of child diet, what aspects of child diet are most important in the development of caries, and how dental treatment influences subsequent dietary patterns. The proposed exploratory/developmental research makes use of a rich complement of dental and dietary data being collected prospectively on 900 children as part of project within the Northeast Center for Research to Evaluate and Eliminate Dental Disparities. Low-income predominantly non-white children ages 2 to 6 years are being studied at three time points over a 12-month period. Equal numbers of children with severe early childhood caries and caries-free control children have been enrolled. A cariogenicity classification system will be developed based on foods identified by 24-hour diet recall interview and food frequency questionnaire, and used to systematically develop and test a pediatric ""dietary cariogenicity index"" to represent total dietary cariogenicity based on both the physical form and timing of food consumed. Secondarily, we will explore comprehensively the impact of S-ECC on dietary patterns, and evaluate changes in dietary patterns and dietary cariogenicity following comprehensive dental treatment. Collectively, these activities will improve our ability to characterize child diets with methodology relevant for oral health, and to inform prevention efforts and our ability to intervene in children with early childhood caries. Project Narrative: Improved methodology for the study of oral health/nutrition linkages as well as better understanding of the associations between eating patterns and early childhood caries are urgently needed. Together these advances will support increasingly focused clinical research in prevention and treatment efforts aimed at early childhood caries, a condition which disproportionately impacts children of racial/ethnic minorities as well as those of lower socioeconomic status.          ",Severe Early Childhood Caries: Role of Dietary Cariogenicity and Eating Patterns,7674817,R21DE018119,"['Knowledge ', ' Dietary Sugars ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Attention ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Hour ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' Awareness ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Beverages ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Dietary Assessment ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities ', ' NCMHD ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' evidence base ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Juice ', ' Divorce ', ' Dietary intake ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Low income ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' U-Series Cooperative Agreements ', ' Cooperative Agreements ', ' Data ', ' Dietary Factors ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Intake ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Observational Study ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Food ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Natural History ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Hay fever ', ' pollenosis ', ' Seasonal Rhinitis ', ' Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal ', ' Hayfever ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Lesion ', ' teacher ', ' Fiber ', ' Dental ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Low Income Population ', ' sugar ', ' Measurement ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Parents ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Sleep ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' ']",NIDCR,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,R21,2009,206250,0.06831981677837137

"Longitudinal Study of Dental Caries in VLBW Infants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This longitudinal study addresses the relationship between birth weight and early childhood caries (ECC) in a cohort of pre-term very low birth weight (VLBW) and full-term normal birth weight (NBW) infants. VLBW and ECC disproportionately affects poor and minority children costing Medicaid billions of dollars annually for treatment. The improved survival of VLBW children has resulted in greater long-term disabilities and need for health services, thus classifying them as children with special health care needs. The oral health needs of VLBW children have not been adequately studied. VLBW children are known to have a high prevalence of enamel defects in the primary dentition, which in turn can lead to increased susceptibility to ECC. Socio- behavioral factors that can predispose some children to ECC are unknown in VLBW children. Therefore the primary aims of the study are to (1) assess the incidence of ECC in VLBW and NBW infants; (2) assess mediators such as the incidence of developmental enamel defects, S.mutans infection and the extent of oral health behaviors in VLBW and NEW infants; (3) assess the indirect relationship between birth weight and ECC via mediators after controlling for independent moderating variables. A total of 200 VLBW and 200 NBW infants will be followed at 8 and 18-20 months corrected age. The proposed study will collect data on caries (decayed and filled surfaces), mediating biological variables (enamel hypoplasia and opacity, S.mutans levels) and infant oral health behavior (feeding, diet, oral hygiene practices, and dental access), and independent variables (demographics, parent predisposing, enabling, need characteristics, dental behavior, biological and child medical factors). Data analysis for testing aims 1 and 2 includes the generalized estimating equations (GEE) models, and a two-stage structural equations model (SEM) for testing the role of mediators in aim 3. The sample size provide 85 to 99% power to compare the two groups in terms of the three study aims. The results of this study will provide critical data to address the knowledge gaps in taking care of VLBW children. The clinical implications include primary prevention, early diagnosis and treatment to prevent further susceptibility to dental decay. It is also of public health interest since interventions to target knowledge, attitude, beliefs, and oral health practices can be implemented in programs for special needs children, and there by improve both oral and systemic health.           ",Longitudinal Study of Dental Caries in VLBW Infants,7626034,R01DE017947,"['very low birth weight infant human ', ' very low birth weight ', ' VLBW (human) ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Parents ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Dental Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Streptococcus mutans ', ' S.mutans ', ' S. mutans ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Washington ', ' Oral ', ' Live Birth ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' interest ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Equation ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' early childhood ', ' mental development ', ' cohort ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Reporting ', ' Primary Dentition ', ' Deciduous Dentition ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' cost ', ' feeding ', ' Minority ', ' demographics ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Enamel ', ' tooth enamel ', ' Enamel ', ' Dental Enamel Hypoplasia ', ' Hypoplastic Enamel ', ' Enamel Hypoplasia ', ' Enamel Agenesis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diet ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Older Population ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Affect ', ' Dental General Practice ', ' dental practice ', ' Age ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Needs ', ' Alaska ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Survivors ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Infection ', ' Dental Insurance ', ' dental health insurance ', ' Periodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontia insurance ', ' Oral Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Surgery Insurance ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Dental ', ' disability ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Sample Size ', ' Perinatal Care ', ' Medicaid ', ' Medicine ', ' Collaborations ', ' Very Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' ']",NIDCR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,422617,0.19483193891418546
"Oral Health Disparities Among High-Risk Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award for Monica Fisher, DDS, MS, MPH, PhD. This award would allow Dr. Fisher to meet her long-term career goal to conduct productive and innovative patient-oriented research that focuses on oral health disparities and treatment effectiveness among high-risk populations. An immediate career goal is to gain additional expertise relevant to research on oral health disparities among high-risk populations.      We propose 3 aims related to career development and 4 related to the research plan. Dr. Fisher's career development aims are to: (1) obtain advanced biostatistical training; (2) increase analytical expertise in the areas of treatment effectiveness and smoking as a major risk factor for oral disease and its systemic effects; and (3) use these findings as preliminary data for subsequent R03 and R01 grant applications. The Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health highlights the imperative for rigorous studies on oral health disparities in high-risk populations, studies on smoking as a major risk factor, and studies on linkages between oral and general health. Therefore, the research plan comprises investigations of oral health disparities among high-risk populations (data from the Florida Dental Care Study) and persons with systemic conditions (data from the third National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey). The specific aims of the research plan are to test hypotheses that among highrisk populations: (4) dental care is effective in facilitating recovery and preventing oral health-related quality of life decrements, but varies by race and socioeconomic status (SES); (5) dental care is effective in facilitating recovery and preventing oral diseases, but varies by race and SES; (6) periodontal disease is associated with heart disease and glycemic control in diabetics, in analyses restricted to non-smokers; (7) self-reported need for a dental cleaning is associated with heart disease and glycemic control in diabetics, in analyses restricted to non-smokers.  This activity will take place in highly supportive research environments. Co-mentors Gregg Gilbert, DDS, MBA, Mark Litaker, PhD, and George Taylor, DMD, DrPH, national experts in their fields, will supervise Dr. Fisher's research and career development. The proposed plans will intensify and focus Dr. Fisher's career development, and make innovative, methodologically sophisticated contributions to the literature.

The initial theme of this Center is to reduce disparities in cancer survival by promoting early detection of oral and pharyngeal cancer (OPC) through two community-based theoretically-derived intervention projects. Community-based interventions built on strong theory are rare in oral health disparity research. A major strength of this application is the inclusion of an evidence base to support our research methodology. The first project will refine and upgrade health care providers' ability to detect early stages of OPC using evidence-based health education theory and the second will apply theoretically derived health promotion models to increase the likelihood that African American men obtain regular OPC screening exams. An R21-level project to validate a cellular biomarker related to susceptibility to squamous cell carcinoma is also proposed. The second theme of this Center is to apply community-based research principles gleaned from aforementioned work to follow-up projects that will address communities' oral health needs. One such R21-level developmental project will determine feasibility of conducting large scale preventive and treatment intervention in a well defined population of low-income minority children with aggressive periodontitis. It is expected that both R21-level projects will lead to full community-based interventions. This Center will facilitate oral health disparity research by 1) providing new resources through which multi-disciplinary teams jointly conduct targeted community-based intervention research; 2) strengthening the partnerships among researchers, clinicians, and the community; and 3) developing a pipeline of oral health disparity researchers and leaders. Our longstanding partnerships enable us to disseminate the results of our research such that we influence the dental/medical community, community members/patients, and policymakers alike. As proposed, the Center will produce a synergistic force resulting in a measurable reduction of disparities in oral health among the underserved. Community partners include the Alachua County Organization for Rural Needs (ACORN, a clinic to serve low-income rural and minority patients), Florida state dental organizations, Department of Health, faith-based community organizations (ACTION network and 4A's), and Florida A&M University, a historically Black College/University. The research conducted by the Southeast Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health (CRRDOH) will generate an evidence base that will affect public policy and will result in long term benefits for disadvantaged citizens.    ",Southeast Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health,7691274,U54DE019261,[''],NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,U54,2009,2125420,0.29085152574150813
"Planning for International Studies of Population Oral Health Determinants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are powerful ""macro-level"" determinants of health that are fixed within populations, but which vary between populations. We hypothesize that quantifiable national macro-level determinants can be identified that will explain variation in oral health above and beyond variation attributable to characteristics of individuals within nations. Objectives: In response to PAR-06-219, the goals of this two-year planning project are to develop a study protocol and funding applications to investigate macro-level determinants of oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL). The project has four Specific Aims: 1) to assemble a collaborative team of researchers who have measured OHRQoL in six national surveys; 2) to establish new collaborations with researchers from other disciplines so that we can identify a comprehensive set of macro-level determinants; 3) to undertake preliminary studies of hypothesized macro-level determinants of oral health from each country; and 4) to develop a detailed study protocol that would undertake analysis of available datasets with multiple levels of health determinants. Relevance: These aims are of direct relevance to Goal 7 of the NIH/NIDCR strategic plan that seeks to ""Assess the social, educational and economic impact of oral ... conditions"" and of Healthy People 2010 which aims ""to help individuals of all ages increase life expectancy and improve their quality of life"". Research design: During the first year of NIH funding, we will hold one face-to-face investigators' meeting and monthly teleconference calls among the applicants. The meetings will be concerned primarily with hypothesis generation and identification of data sources. Between meetings, pilot studies will be undertaken to address methodology at each of the applicant institutions (Adelaide, Australia; Newcastle, UK; and Oulu, Finland). The primary outcomes for Year 1 will be: a) expansion of the team of investigators to include five additional consultants; b) compilation of a data dictionary describing oral health survey items and macro-level variables available in six countries; and c) methodological pilot studies examining macro-level determinants of oral health within three of the collaborating countries. In Year 2, we will identify new contextual variables, finalize hypotheses and complete pilot studies for the Year 2 grant application. At the second face-to-face meeting of the expanded group of investigators, pilot investigations conducted during Year 1 will be reviewed. Those results will also help finalization of the conceptual framework that was initiated in Year 1. We will spend the remainder of the year working with newly-recruited investigators to identify data sources from their own disciplines (e.g. geography, economics) that will be included in the Year 2 grant application. We will also complete the manuscript begun in Year 1 and submit it for publication. Finally, we plan to submit funding applications to at least two agencies that support international collaborative studies. Project Narrative: This project is relevant to public health because it will develop a study identifying ""macro-level"" features of nations that influence population oral health. Examples of macro-level determinants include social services and health programs, both in the public and private sector. In addition to identifying upstream causes of health disparities within countries, the planned study can point to health policy interventions needed to improve health in those nations.          ",Planning for International Studies of Population Oral Health Determinants,7643354,R21DE018980,"['Data Sources ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Dentistry ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Dictionary ', ' Institution ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' International ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Social Health Services ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Finland ', ' Geography ', ' Germany ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Dental ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Malaysia ', ' Malaya ', ' Malay Federation ', ' Federation of Malaya ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' National Health Policy ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Private Sector ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Records ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sociology ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Teleconferences ', ' United Kingdom ', ' United States ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Australia ', ' Dimensions ', ' Oral ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' Belief ', ' meetings ', ' Manuscripts ', ' economic impact ', ' Population Study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Censuses ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Tooth Loss ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Oral Health Impact Profile ', ' oral status ', ' health related quality of life ', ' care systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' primary outcome ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2009,131324,0.23665924578751676
"Alkali production in human dental plaque and saliva as predictor of caries risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Caries continues to be a prevalent disease with high incidence among all age groups. Ammonia production from the hydrolysis of arginine and urea by enzymes of oral bacteria moderates plaque acidification and may inhibit dental caries, as suggested by in vitro studies and indirect clinical observations. The objective of this study is to examine the relationship of arginine deiminase (AD) and urease activities with dental caries status at the clinical level. We hypothesize that AD and urease activities in plaque and/or saliva of caries free subjects is significantly higher than in caries active subjects. AD and urease activities will be measured in dental plaque and saliva samples from caries free subjects, caries experienced subjects, and subjects with at least 4 teeth with active caries. Specific Aim (SA) 1 will determine the magnitude and the direction of the association between plaque and saliva AD and urease activity levels with dental caries in human subjects. SA 2 will examine the relationship between AD and urease activity levels with the numbers of selected major acid-producing and alkali-producing bacterial species in the oral samples. SA 3 will investigate the predictors of AD and urease activity levels. SA 1 will be met through a case-control study and SA 2 will be met using a sub-sample of the subjects (10 with the highest, 10 with the lowest, and 10 with medium plaque AD and urease levels). SA3 will be met by gathering information on patient's age, gender, race, dental history, plaque, and frequency of oral care, and investigating the relationship of these explanatory factors to AD and urease activity levels in plaque and saliva. If the results of the present study support an association between AD and/or urease activity levels with dental caries in adults, the knowledge obtained will be applied to the design of a prospective cohort study at the end of the grant period, which will determine whether this association is a cause-and-effect one. If AD and urease activity levels are shown to be predictive of caries risk in adults, either alone or in combination with other risk factors, we will then apply this relationship to the development of novel approaches for early identification of individuals at risk to develop caries and for caries prevention strategies.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will contribute to the development of novel methods for caries risk assessment and prevention, while providing a better understanding of unknown factors affecting caries risk.           The proposed study will contribute to the development of novel methods for caries risk assessment and prevention, while providing a better understanding of unknown factors affecting caries risk.",Alkali production in human dental plaque and saliva as predictor of caries risk,7694347,R21DE018392,"['Cytoplasm ', ' Acids ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Enamel ', ' tooth enamel ', ' Enamel ', ' Dental Plaque ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Enzymes ', ' Alkalinization ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fermentation ', ' Killings ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' remineralization ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Hydrolysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Alkalies ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Dental ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' enzyme activity ', ' Methods ', ' Ammonia ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Streptococcus salivarius ', ' S.salivarius ', ' S. salivarius ', ' Probability ', ' Production ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Streptococcus gordonii ', ' S.gordonii ', ' S. gordonii ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Saliva ', ' Societies ', ' Arginine ', ' L-Isomer Arginine ', ' L-Arginine ', ' Knowledge ', ' Streptococcus sanguis ', ' S.sanguis ', ' S. sanguis ', ' Time ', ' Tooth structure ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Urea ', ' Ureaphil ', ' Urea Carbamide ', ' Elaqua XX ', ' Carbamide ', ' Urease ', ' Urea Amidohydrolase ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Severities ', ' Oral ', ' Salivary ', ' Streptococcus parasanguis ', ' S.parasanguis ', ' S. parasanguis ', ' Source ', ' Bacteria ', ' Arginine deiminase ', ' arginine iminohydrolase ', ' arginine dihydrolase ', ' arginine converting enzyme ', ' meetings ', ' information gathering ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' oral bacteria ', ' oral flora ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Prevention ', ' Catabolism ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Carbon Dioxide ', ' Carbonic Anhydride ', ' CO2 ', ' social ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Early identification ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Sampling ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' oral biofilm ', ' oral care ', ' oral streptococci ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' demineralization ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2009,183125,0.12016170614334734
"Assessing contribution of the dental care system to oral health care disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited access to dental care exacerbates oral health care disparities in underserved populations. The barriers in access at the individual level have been explored to a large extent; however, the impact of the dental care system on access is poorly understood. Reduced access has been linked to a lower overall supply of dentists, but little is known about the relationship between the specific characteristics of dental providers, such as education and practice setting, and access. The specific aims of this project are: 1) to assess the impact of dentist characteristics on access to dental care of underserved populations; and 2) to assess the potential differences in impact of dentist characteristics on specific categories of the underserved, such as children, low- income, and racial/ethnic populations. Using Andersen's conceptual framework of access to care, it is hypothesized that access to dental care is influenced by the context in which dental care is delivered, or the dental care system, in addition to individual characteristics. Measures of the dental care system are primarily conceptualized as personal and practice characteristics of dentists in the medical study service area where individuals reside. The data for this study include an existing population-based survey of individuals, an existing representative survey of dentists in private practice, and existing administrative data. The dependent variables (length of time since last dental visit and unmet dental care) and individual level independent variables will be obtained from the population survey. Independent variables measuring personal and practice characteristics of dentists will be obtained from the dentist survey. Examples of the latter measures are percentages of private practice dentists in the medical study service area who accept discounted fees, participate in public insurance programs, or have large practices (as indicated by number of various personnel and multiple practice locations). Additional independent variables on supply or availability of other dental care providers will be obtained from administrative data (e.g. designation of dental health professional shortage area, number of visits to community-based clinics). The impact of dentist characteristics on access will be examined in multinomial and dichotomous logistic regression models, controlling for individual and other predictors of access to dental care. Both models will be stratified by subgroups of underserved populations to assess potential differences in predictors of access among groups. Improving access to dental care is the solution most likely to reduce observed disparities in oral health of underserved populations. Research that identifies systemic barriers in access to care of the underserved populations is needed to inform policies designed to diminish oral health disparities.

"Sociodemographic, Biosocial and Behavioral Mechanisms Linked to Earlier Oral Agin    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this project is to develop a biopsychosocial model that explains how sociodemographic, biosocial, behavioral factors interact with one another to lead to differential oral health in later life. Oral aging indicators examined in this project include tooth count, tooth decay, periodontal disease, and oral symptoms such as dry mouth and difficulty chewing foods. We will examine the effect on oral aging of the proposed mechanisms including race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health care use and availability, chronic health conditions, psychological and cognitive characteristics, and biological risk factors. We will specifically examine the age patterns of the relationship between oral health and various biopsychosocial factors in order to understand the evidence of earlier aging manifested by the higher presence at a given age of oral health problems in some subgroups of the population such as the poor and members of some racial and ethnic minority groups. We are particularly interested in looking at the link between some biological risk factors and oral health including indicators of inflammatory, immune and metabolic system processes, and bone density. This project will use the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2006, and 1988-1994 for mortality-linked analyses and analyses with CMV. NHANES-mortality linked data set will allow us to develop healthy life expectancy based on oral health indicators such as years of life without periodontal disease and years of life with natural teeth. A rich set of examined dental measures and potential mechanisms including biomarkers measured in NHANES provides an unparalleled opportunity to systematically and comprehensively study how mechanisms interact with one another to produce oral health and how some groups of our population get to poorer oral health outcomes, which can be an indicator of earlier aging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is important to understand how demographic, socioeconomic, psychological, medical and biological factors interact to produce oral health disparities across population subgroups in the United States. Better understanding the mediating factors and their interactions would not only help reduce the disparities of oral health among different populations, but it would also help provide strategies to improve oral health status. In addition, given that oral health status can be related to major chronic conditions related to aging, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoporosis, it is important to understand interacting mechanisms by which oral health care and other medical care can be coordinated to improve overall health status.              7.

"University of Guam/Cancer Research Center of Hawaii Partnership (1 of 2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Oral cancer is the sixth leading cancer in the world, and ranks in the top three cancers in countries where betel nut (also known as areca nut) chewing is common. In Micronesia, a group of Pacific Islands where betel nut is frequently chewed, the risk of oral cancer is elevated, but quite variable across populations. For the period 1985-1998 (age-adjusted to the 1988 U.S. population), the prevalence per 100,000 ranged from 4.2 in Chuuk to 31.8 in Yap. In Guam, the incidence of mouth cancer per 100,000 population for the period 1997-2003, age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. population, varied between 8.1 for Chamorros to 17.9 among other Micronesians. The disparity in oral cancer rates among these populations may be due to differences in betel nut chewing patterns. To investigate the effect of chewing patterns, we must be able to conduct studies on multiple Micronesian islands with differing chewing patterns. Previously, we developed a comprehensive betel nut assessment protocol and a protocol for detecting oral lesions on Guam. The overall objectives of the pilot study are to further develop and test these methods, and to demonstrate that they can be applied in a research study of betel nut use on an island other than Guam. A convenience sample of 100 Micronesians (50 men and 50 women) who are long-term betel nut users (regular use for at least 10 years) will be recruited from the island of Saipan in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). We will collect data on betel nut use, presence of oral precancerous lesions, diet, demographics, anthropometry, medical history, and physical activity. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) collect information on betel nut use among study participants and other members of their families, 2) perform oral examinations, and biopsies, as needed, on study participants, 3) measure other health risks among this population, including obesity, high blood pressure, self-reported history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and unhealthy dietary practices and 4) examine associations of duration, frequency, and type of betel nut use with oral pre-cancers and with other health risks. This pilot project will help formulate the research methods for studying betel nut use and disease risk in Micronesia, and will provide the necessary preliminary data for a full multi-island study of betel nut use and the prevalence of oral lesions. Ultimately, a better understanding of these associations will provide important new directions for reduction of health risks through educational efforts and targeted intervention strategies.              ",University of Guam/Cancer Research Center of Hawaii Partnership (1 of 2),7786722,U54CA143727,[''],NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,U54,2009,635679,0.2111930028514738
"Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early childhood caries (ECC) is the most prevalent chronic childhood disease in the U.S., particularly among economically disadvantaged, underserved children. We propose to continue our existing Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health (U54DE014251) and its efforts to understand, prevent, and reduce oral health disparities, with a focus on preventing ECC. The themes of our collaborative, community-based program are (1) to provide the high-quality evidence base for new methods to prevent ECC in populations experiencing oral-health disparities and (2) to identify the most effective dissemination methods for delivering fluoride varnish (FV), an efficacious preventive method. We will actively engage California communities and providers in two large-scale intervention studies utilizing randomized clinical trial (RCT) methodology, stratified by settings, to assess the effectiveness or clinical efficacy of different preventive methods on caries incidence and increment among low-income children. Using the RE-AIM framework, Project 1 will identify the most effective setting (medical, social service agency or dental) to disseminate FV to the greatest number of 1-3-year-old children. Stratifying on setting, a parallel groups practical RCT will be conducted in 24 community-based primary care clinics (CPCCs) from the UCSF primary care collaborative research network, and 24 California Special Supplemental Nutrition Programs for Women, Infants and Children (WICs). Each non-dental site (CPCC or WIC) will be randomized to a program of parental counseling and onsite FV application or to parental counseling and referral to a dentist for child's FV application. We will also compare two automated telephone counseling methods and utilize teledentistry approaches for blinded caries assessments. Project 2 is an intervention study to be conducted in dental and non-dental settings, both affiliated with Federally Qualified Health Centers near the US-Mexico border, to compare the relative caries prevention efficacy of four protocols in 3-6 year-old children: 1) parental oral-health counseling (C) alone; 2) C+ FV; 3) C+ fluoride-releasing, glass ionomer (Gl) sealants applied to primary molars, and 4) C+FV+ Gl. Our Administrative Core, Statistics and Data Coordinating Center, and Community Liaison Program will support our two RCTs and developmental projects. These endeavors, with other education and career development activities, will foster new investigators to increase oral-health-disparity research capacity.     ",Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health,7692894,U54DE019285,[''],NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U54,2009,3530469,0.2200410498739798
"Beverage consumption and early childhood caries trends    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite significant advances in the understanding of the caries process and in the interventions needed to prevent it, early childhood caries (ECC) remains one of the most prevalent diseases among children in the United States and the world. The main objective of this study is to determine if there is a relationship between increasing consumption of putative cariogenic beverages, such as 100% juice, juice drinks and soda, and the increase in ECC observed between the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1988-1994, and NHANES 1999-2004. We hypothesize that an increased consumption of these beverages, along with a decrease in milk intake between 1988-94 and 1999-2004 is associated with increase in the prevalence of ECC. We also hypothesized that cariogenic beverage consumption may contribute to the disparity observed in the prevalence of ECC among sociodemographic groups. The specific aims of this study are Aim 1: To determine if the strength of the association between caries and cariogenic beverage consumption among preschool children has changed between NHANES III and NHANES 99-04. Aim 2: To determine among socioeconomic groups of preschoolers if the strength of the association between caries and cariogenic beverage consumption has changed between NHANES III and NHANES 99-04. Aim 3: To identify beverages that may modify the association between cariogenic beverages and caries among preschool children in NHANES III and NHANES 99-04 and to determine if their consumption has changed between the 2 surveys. To achieve these specific aims data for children 2-6 years of age from NHANES III and from NHANES 1999-2004 will be analyzed. Data on beverage consumption and dental caries will be modeled with sociodemographic characteristics using Poisson and logistic regressions. Finding associations between beverage consumption and caries may suggest reasons for the lack of reduction in ECC, and will provide support for targeted dietary educational programs. Caries prevention interventions at the community level would improve resource utilization and reduce societal healthcare needs and at the individual level; dental disease prevention will set the stage for healthier lives.

"Northwest/Alaska/Hawaii Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Northwest/Alaska/Hawaii Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities at the University of Washington in Seattle focuses on tooth decay in children, because it is the major oral health challenge U.S. society faces. Tooth decay in preschool children is worsening. The Healthy People 2010 Midcourse Review found the country moving away from national targets for young children: 22% of children 2-4 years of age have tooth decay while the target is 11%. The research plan addresses disparities and inequities in access to dental care and to healthy teeth (tooth decay or caries prevention) for low-income and vulnerable mothers and children within a conceptual framework that specifies the ecological nature of disparity problems. The specific aims of the community-based multidisciplinary research plan are to: 1) Conduct human trials to evaluate the efficacy of interventions to prevent and treat dental caries in children and their caretakers; 2) Develop community-based research that translates existing knowledge and new information into technologies and interventions that will reduce disparities; and 3) Encourage and support developmental research that has the potential to lead to independent studies to address and reduce caries inequity in children. The Center includes the Research Program Administrative Center (RPAC), two major community based intervention trials focused on dental caries- Community-Based Intergenerational Oral Health Promotion In Rural America and Parent-Child Toothbrushing with 1000 ppm Fluoride Toothpaste to Prevent ECC-and a Statistics and Data Coordinating Center (S&DCC). Primary research program sites include 12 rural county health departments in the State of Oregon serving whites and Latinos, a training center in Klamath County Oregon, and large Community Health Centers serving minority communities in Woodburn, Oregon (Salud Medical Center, Latinos) and Waianae Coast, Hawaii (Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders). Further dissemination sites are in the Alaska bush, rural Hawaii and Washington State. Developmental research projects involve communities in rural Eastern and Southwestern Washington State and focus on school nutrition and the use of topical PVP-iodine and fluoride varnish in caries prevention. The Center also includes a training core to increase the cadre of oral health disparities researchers through clinical research training and mentoring for junior scientists, efforts to enhance the awareness of health disparities research in the predoctoral curriculum in dentistry and medicine, and increases the numbers of minority and rural students entering dentistry and health sciences disciplines.       ",Northwest/Alaska/Hawaii Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities,7929079,U54DE019346,"['Critiques ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Dedications ', ' dental

"Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early childhood caries (ECC) is the most prevalent chronic childhood disease in the U.S., particularly among economically disadvantaged, underserved children. We propose to continue our existing Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health (U54DE014251) and its efforts to understand, prevent, and reduce oral health disparities, with a focus on preventing ECC. The themes of our collaborative, community-based program are (1) to provide the high-quality evidence base for new methods to prevent ECC in populations experiencing oral-health disparities and (2) to identify the most effective dissemination methods for delivering fluoride varnish (FV), an efficacious preventive method. We will actively engage California communities and providers in two large-scale intervention studies utilizing randomized clinical trial (RCT) methodology, stratified by settings, to assess the effectiveness or clinical efficacy of different preventive methods on caries incidence and increment among low-income children. Using the RE-AIM framework, Project 1 will identify the most effective setting (medical, social service agency or dental) to disseminate FV to the greatest number of 1-3-year-old children. Stratifying on setting, a parallel groups practical RCT will be conducted in 24 community-based primary care clinics (CPCCs) from the UCSF primary care collaborative research network, and 24 California Special Supplemental Nutrition Programs for Women, Infants and Children (WICs). Each non-dental site (CPCC or WIC) will be randomized to a program of parental counseling and onsite FV application or to parental counseling and referral to a dentist for child's FV application. We will also compare two automated telephone counseling methods and utilize teledentistry approaches for blinded caries assessments. Project 2 is an intervention study to be conducted in dental and non-dental settings, both affiliated with Federally Qualified Health Centers near the US-Mexico border, to compare the relative caries prevention efficacy of four protocols in 3-6 year-old children: 1) parental oral-health counseling (C) alone; 2) C+ FV; 3) C+ fluoride-releasing, glass ionomer (Gl) sealants applied to primary molars, and 4) C+FV+ Gl. Our Administrative Core, Statistics and Data Coordinating Center, and Community Liaison Program will support our two RCTs and developmental projects. These endeavors, with other education and career development activities, will foster new investigators to increase oral-health-disparity research capacity.        ",Center to Address Disparities in

"Dental Biologics for Underserved Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities of oral health care are a significantly under-addressed area of health disparities. A substantial population, primarily those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged and of ethnic groups including Hispanics, African Americans and Native Americans, have alarmingly poor access to oral health care. Dental pulp is vascularized connective tissue in the central core of a tooth, and maintains homeostasis of the tooth as   a biologically viable organ. When caries or trauma involves dental pulp, endodontic therapies are indicated. In irreversible pulpitis, the dentist or endodontist extirpates dental pulp, and obturates the instrumented root canal with bioinert materials. A total of approximately 16 million endodontic procedures are performed each year in the United States alone. However, individuals of socioeconomically disadvantaged populations have little access to root canal therapy, and frequently have their infected teeth extracted. Whereas root canal therapy is one of the successful dental treatments, complications have been repeatedly documented in the literature.  Secondary infections due to coronal leakage or undetected accessory canals are not uncommon, and require re-treatment. A substantial amount of tooth structure is removed during root canal treatment, leading to increased incidences of tooth fracture. Root canal treated teeth are devoid of innervation and pulpal sensation,   and thus are deprived of the ability to detect secondary infections. Our preliminary data demonstrate, for the first time, that endodontically treated human teeth are recellularized and revascularized in vivo. Accordingly, the overall goal of this SBIR/Phase-I proposal is to develop biologically based approaches for dental pulp regeneration at a cost that is substantially less than the current root canal therapy and readily accessible by underserved populations who currently have little access to conventional root canal therapy.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This SBIR/Phase I project will address a substantial disparity in oral health care by developing novel therapies for dental pulp regeneration. A total of   approximately 16 million endodontic procedures are performed each year in the United States alone. However, current root canal therapy is an expensive dental treatment with alarmingly poor access by socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, and yet leads to de-vitalized pulp tissue. We have generated preliminary data to demonstrate that dental pulp regeneration can be realized in human teeth at a fraction of the cost of current root canal therapy. We propose to take advantage of the SBIR mechanism to develop biologically based, regenerative root canal therapy that is affordable and accessible by underserved populations.           This SBIR/Phase I project will address a substantial disparity in oral health care by developing novel therapies for dental pulp regeneration.

"Community Oral Health Interventions Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of the proposed Community Oral Health Interventions Program (COHIP) is to develop and implement an integrated model for reducing oral health disparities. COHIP's vision, mission, and design framework were developed with direct input from community partners and the findings for the Detroit Dental Health Project (DDHP), a disparity research center funded by NIH. The DDHP has had a successful model for understanding the determinants of oral health disparities and has built a strong community and organizational foundations. The DDHP has produced so far over 19 refereed publications, 3 PhD dissertations, and 2 MSc theses. Moreover, the DDHP core leadership has managed during the last 6 years a complex research project focusing on families of low-income African-American children. The findings from the DDHP underscore the need for multi-level interventions. Following the Ottawa and Jakarta Declarations for health promotion, COHIP was designed to intervene on key social, behavioral, and clinical factors of oral health disparities. The COHIP will focus on building healthy communities around four dental clinics owned by 2 Federally Qualified Health Centers. Around each clinic the lowest income census tracts will be selected to target a population of 16,023 children aged 0-11 years and their caregivers. The selected areas will be stratified into small clusters of households and randomized into intervention and comparison groups. COHIP includes three clustered randomized demonstration trials targeting the same families. One project will aim to intervene on the social, behavioral, and biological determinants of dental caries; another will focus on resolving a major problem identified in the DDHP analyses where children who get care have a significant proportion of their cavitated tooth surfaces left untreated within 2 years of follow-up; and the third will focus on reducing the significant disparities in periodontal diseases on adults by intervening on the social, behavioral, and biological risk factors of periodontal diseases. COHIP has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of social, behavioral, biological, dental, medical and organizational researchers. COHIP plans to intervene at the community and clinical levels. Sustainability of the COHIP model is a requirement demanded by the community partners. COHIP is collaborating with FQHC operational experts and has the support of HRSA regional office, University of Michigan ($1 Million grant), and the NNHOA.     ",Community Oral Health Interventions Program,7691759,U01DE019258,"['Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Clinics ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Low income ', ' Caring ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Grant ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Household ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Dental ', ' Leadership ', ' Funding ', ' Michigan ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Periodontal Diseases ', ' periodontium disorder ', ' periodontium disease ', ' periodontal disorder ', ' Parodontosis ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' United States Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' HRSA ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' tooth surface ', ' intervention program ', ' social ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' comparison group ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2009,742262,0.29303359632721904
"Contra Caries: Preventing ECC Using a Promotora Model for Rural Latino Families    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R21 application is to support pilot work examining the acceptability and feasibility of a culturally-appropriate, rigorously designed, implemented and evaluated, trained community-based Latino lay health worker (promotora) educational intervention. This intervention aims to reduce oral health disparities due to prevalence of early childhood caries (ECC) in children in rural, Latino families. ECC, (baby bottle tooth decay or cavities) the most common infectious disease of childhood (Surgeon General 2000) and a major unmet health care need (Newacheck et al 2000), is highly prevalent among low- income, rural preschool aged children, especially those of Mexican-origin. The proposed study will occur in two stages. Stage 1 addresses development, refinement and acceptability of the program and evaluation methods to promotoras, participants and the community using focus groups and other qualitative research methods. The curriculum is guided by Social Cognitive Theory. Stage 2 addresses feasibility and fidelity issues by implementing and evaluating the promotora training and pilot interactive oral health education program for 100 parents of children aged 1 to 5 years in Salinas, CA, a predominantly Latino agricultural community. We aim to assess, via pre-test post-test changes (at completion of program and 3-months after completion), whether the proposed intervention program: 1) Increases parental understanding of the mechanism and consequences of caries, knowledge of effective preventive activities including the role of fluoride, and understanding and knowledge about oral health generally including access to and use of oral health professionals, 2) Increases parental knowledge, skills and sense of self-efficacy with respect to their role in affecting their children's oral health care at home, including where, when and how to enroll children for oral services. The direction and amount of change in parental knowledge, attitude, practices and self- efficacy will be assessed. Rigorous process and outcome evaluation strategies will be used. If, in addition to meeting the stated objectives, the program is acceptable to the community and its delivery feasible, then an RO1 will be written in the future to support the program with a larger sample of Latino families in a rural location as a randomized rigorously designed, controlled intervention study. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research involves a culturally-appropriate educational intervention focused on parents of Latino children living in a rural area. It addresses Early Childhood Caries (ECC), a major oral health disparity experienced by children under five years of age. The intervention aims to reduce the number of children with ECC through improving parental understanding of its causes, mechanisms, and preventive activities - particularly improved oral hygiene (tooth brushing). The intervention enhances parents' ability to assist and better manage children's oral health care behaviors.           The proposed research involves a culturally-appropriate educational intervention focused on parents of Latino children living in a rural area.

"Causal Mediation Analysis of Dental Caries in VLBW and BPD Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Very low birth weight (VLBW) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are significant health issues which are also risk factors for oral health disease, including dental caries. In addition, VLBW/BPD is associated both with enamel defects, a biological risk factor for caries, and reduced cognitive development which may hinder the acquisition of healthy oral health behavior. Furthermore, both VLBW and BPD disproportionately affect minorities and those with low SES. The relative contributions or `mediating effects' of the various biologic, cognitive/behavior and psychosocial factors to the incidence and progression of oral disease in VLBW/BPD individuals is poorly understood. We propose to develop a new approach to mediation analysis and to analyze data from a unique cohort study to help illuminate the relationship between VLBW/BPD and dental caries. Our data are from a study which collected dental caries, enamel defects and oral health behavior information on a cohort of 302 adolescents previously assessed on medical, cognitive, and psychosocial outcomes at birth and at eight years of age. We propose a flexible new statistical method which translates and elaborates a proposed causal diagram into a system of easily fitted generalized linear models. This general context will allow us to incorporate specialized models, such as the zero-inflated Poisson, for the DMFT/S and other dental caries outcomes. We use a potential outcomes framework to develop mediation measures which may be expressed as functions of parameters from our general model. An additional aim of our project is to conduct simulation studies to examine the bias and efficiency of our mediation effect estimators, with a focus on robustness to model departures. Our development and study of methods for mediation analysis will facilitate their broad applicability for dental health and other studies. By helping to illuminate causal mechanisms in the relationship between VLBW/BPD and adolescent dental caries, we also hope to contribute to the development of effective new intervention programs for these special needs children.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to learn about the reasons (whether they are biologic, oral health behavioral, or both) for the increased risk of dental caries among adolescents with very low birth weight (VLBW) and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Our specific goals are to develop new statistical methods to handle complex causal models and to use these methods to analyze data from a cohort of adolescents followed from birth. By understanding the mechanisms leading to dental caries in VLBW/BPD children, we can more effectively intervene to improve the oral and general health of these special needs children.           This project seeks to learn about the reasons (whether they are biologic, oral health behavioral, or both) for the increased risk of dental caries among adolescents with very low birth weight (VLBW) and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

"Health literacy and oral health status of African refugees    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Refugees often arrive in the United States (U.S.) with unmet health needs and significant barriers to care related to linguistic and cultural access. In particular, oral health problems have been identified as the most common health problem of newly arrived refugee children and second most common among refugee adults. Oral health disparities seen among U.S. populations are therefore also likely to be common among refugees and similar immigrant populations entering the U.S. From 1995 - 2005, 21,868 total refugees entered Massachusetts from an increasingly diverse array of countries, particularly in Africa. Most recent refugees from Africa in Massachusetts arrive with rudimentary English literacy skills. While low health literacy contributes significantly to poor oral health status in the U.S., its relationship with oral health status among refugees is unclear. In previous research, we have found that on arrival in the U.S., African refugees have less tooth decay than other refugees while still having high rates of other oral health problems such as gingivitis. Very little is known about how refugees' English literacy levels affect oral health status over time in the U.S. Lastly, it is unclear to what extent refugees' oral health problems improve, persist, or worsen once in the U.S. These findings and issues suggest the need to evaluate the impact of health literacy on oral health outcomes among refugees and immigrants. Therefore, the investigators propose to use mixed quantitative and qualitative methods in a cross-sectional study of newly arrived Somali refugees to determine the relationship between basic English language literacy and oral health status. They hypothesize that increased English literacy may lead to better oral health status independently of the adoption of Western cultural and social factors affecting oral health status, i.e. acculturation. The study will evaluate the impact of English functional health literacy on oral screening examination findings, experience with dental care, and perceptions and knowledge of other key factors that are known to impact on oral health status. Qualitative assessments will focus on experiences with resettlement, oral health, and literacy/education as well as the role of life stressors in determining oral health practices. Findings subsequently may be used to help design culturally acceptable preventive services and public health interventions directed at refugees and immigrants in the U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: No previous study has investigated the relationships between literacy, acculturation, and oral health clinical outcomes among refugees. This study represents an important opportunity to define these relationships and identify areas in which preventive oral health interventions may be directed. Preventive oral health interventions directed toward the growing immigrant and refugee populations in the U.S. will be important for reducing oral health disparities and their associated personal and societal costs for these communities and the larger U.S. population.          ",Health literacy and oral health status of African refugees,7559932,R01DE017716,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Performance at work ', ' work performance ', ' job performance ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Preventive ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Improve Access ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Gingivitis ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hygiene ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Information Services ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Dental ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' African ', ' literacy ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Immigrant ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Perception ', ' instrument ', ' Refugees ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' English Language ', ' Somalia ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Writing ', ' Oral ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Behavior ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Services ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communications Media ', ' Forms of Communication ', ' Communities ', ' functional health literacy ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' social science research ', ' ']",NIDCR,MASSACHUSETTS STATE DEPT OF PUB HEALTH,R01,2009,522208,0.2535505001294066
"Trends and Trajectories of Oral Health Among Older Americans:  The Role of Cognit    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral health is a critical but often overlooked component of health and well-being in older Americans. Compared to younger individuals, elderly people have an increased incidence and prevalence of oral diseases. Little is known about the patterns of oral health changes in late life at either the population or the individual level. In addition, few studies have examined factors, such as cognitive function, that may be associated with oral health changes. This study has the following specific aims: (1) examine and project racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in oral health trends among older Americans; (2) examine the intra- and inter-individual differences of change in oral health among older adults; (3) cross-sectionally analyze the relationship between cognitive function and oral health; and (4) assess the linkage between cognitive function and oral health among older adults by conducting longitudinal data analysis. This proposed research is innovative in several respects: 1) state-of-the-art analytic approach to analyses on population trends and projections, and individual trajectories of oral health; 2) examination of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in oral health trends and trajectories; 3) focus on individuals with a range of cognitive function (from individuals with potential dementia to cognitively normal); 4) examination of the linkage between cognitive function and oral health while controlling for other important covariates; and 5) use of multiple well-established datasets, including nationally and regionally representative samples, that are longitudinal or cross-sectional in nature, to compare and confirm the patterns and predictors of oral health across the various datasets. We expect our study to lead to a better understanding of the mechanism underlying oral health deterioration and its risk factors. And, in turn, our study may suggest strategies for effective and innovative practices to prevent oral health deterioration. As secondary data will be used, the proposed study is a very cost-effective way to accomplish our objectives.

"Longitudinal Study of Dental Caries in VLBW Infants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This longitudinal study addresses the relationship between birth weight and early childhood caries (ECC) in a cohort of pre-term very low birth weight (VLBW) and full-term normal birth weight (NBW) infants. VLBW and ECC disproportionately affects poor and minority children costing Medicaid billions of dollars annually for treatment. The improved survival of VLBW children has resulted in greater long-term disabilities and need for health services, thus classifying them as children with special health care needs. The oral health needs of VLBW children have not been adequately studied. VLBW children are known to have a high prevalence of enamel defects in the primary dentition, which in turn can lead to increased susceptibility to ECC. Socio- behavioral factors that can predispose some children to ECC are unknown in VLBW children. Therefore the primary aims of the study are to (1) assess the incidence of ECC in VLBW and NBW infants; (2) assess mediators such as the incidence of developmental enamel defects, S.mutans infection and the extent of oral health behaviors in VLBW and NEW infants; (3) assess the indirect relationship between birth weight and ECC via mediators after controlling for independent moderating variables. A total of 200 VLBW and 200 NBW infants will be followed at 8 and 18-20 months corrected age. The proposed study will collect data on caries (decayed and filled surfaces), mediating biological variables (enamel hypoplasia and opacity, S.mutans levels) and infant oral health behavior (feeding, diet, oral hygiene practices, and dental access), and independent variables (demographics, parent predisposing, enabling, need characteristics, dental behavior, biological and child medical factors). Data analysis for testing aims 1 and 2 includes the generalized estimating equations (GEE) models, and a two-stage structural equations model (SEM) for testing the role of mediators in aim 3. The sample size provide 85 to 99% power to compare the two groups in terms of the three study aims. The results of this study will provide critical data to address the knowledge gaps in taking care of VLBW children. The clinical implications include primary prevention, early diagnosis and treatment to prevent further susceptibility to dental decay. It is also of public health interest since interventions to target knowledge, attitude, beliefs, and oral health practices can be implemented in programs for special needs children, and there by improve both oral and systemic health.

"Oral Health of Latino and Ethiopian Children and Their Mothers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract With the launch of Healthy People 2010 and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) strategic plan; goals to eliminate disparities in health and health care have been firmly placed on the national health agenda. To achieve these goals, the Institute of Medicine's Unequal Treatment report recommended that DHHS monitor progress toward the elimination of health care disparities. The report noted the relative paucity of research in health care disparities for non-African American minority groups. Dental caries and its complications are specifically targeted by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research's Plan to Eliminate Health Disparities. Despite significant advances in the understanding of the caries process and in the tools to prevent it, caries is still the most prevalent infectious disease among children, particularly minority and low-income children. Caries in preschool children, also known as Early Childhood Caries, is of particular concern given that its deleterious effects are seen later in life and its treatment requires specialized care even in the operating room under general anesthesia. Early Childhood Caries is the presence of 1 or more decayed (noncavitated or cavitated lesions), missing (due to caries), or filled tooth surfaces in any primary tooth in a child 71 months of age or younger. The overall goal of this mixed-method, community based participatory research project is to improve understanding of early childhood caries and barriers and facilitators for dental care services utilization among Latino and Ethiopian children and their mothers. There are four main aims of this project: 1) Identify knowledge, attitudes and behaviors relating to oral health among mothers who are main caregivers of 0-5 year old Latino and Ethiopian children attending an urban community health center, (2) Compare demographic and sociocultural characteristics of users and nonusers of dental services at an urban community health center, (3) Determine the rate of caries and risk markers (identified in Aims 1 and 2) for Latino, Ethiopian and other children 0-5 years of age and their main caregiver mothers who receive dental services, and (4) Provide train- the-trainer oral health education for personnel of an urban community health center. This project will provide needed information regarding oral health of Central/South American and Ethiopian immigrants, parents' attitudes and beliefs towards dental pain in young children, and maternal oral health knowledge, beliefs and attitudes. Information gained through this collaborative project will be used to plan oral health education efforts at a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) in Washington DC (Mary's Center for Maternal and Child Care), and other Central/South American and Ethiopian communities outside the DC area and support ancillary oral health studies for the NHLBI Hispanic Community Health Study, and a clinical trial planning grant. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Information on dental caries (the most common infectious disease among children); the use of dental services; and oral health knowledge, attitudes and behaviors will be gathered through focus groups, health interview surveys and dental examinations for 0-5 year old Latino and Ethiopian children and their main caregiver mothers attending an urban community health center.

Title: First preventive dental visit: Disparities in needs, costs + behavioral insights This study investigates the predictors and outcomes of age at first preventive dental visit (AFPDV) for Medicaid-enrolled children-a dentally underserved population. The age when a child receives their first dental check-up helps establish a dental home for the child and provides important preventive counseling for the mother. Medicaid-enrolled children are known to have less access to dental care. Of particular interest in this study are five Medicaid subpopulations at high risk of disparities in access to dental care and resulting oral health status: 1) Racial and ethnic minority children, 2) Rural children, 3) Children in federally designated Dental Health Professions Shortage Areas (HPSAs), 4) Children with less access to medical care and associated well child visits, and 5) Children who receive care at a Community Health Center (CHC). Since one in four children in the United States are enrolled in Medicaid, this study could potentially impact a large population of the most vulnerable children in the country. We are proposing a multifaceted, interdisciplinary set of studies to explore this issue: Study 1: Determinants of the age at first preventive dental visit for Medicaid-enrolled children. The first study investigates the predictors of age at first preventive dental visit using Iowa Medicaid claims data for preschool age children who were enrolled in the program within a month of birth in 2004. We will follow these children in the claims database until they have their first preventive dental visit, are no longer enrolled in Medicaid or turn six years old. Factors previously identified in dental use models will be included in these analyses with the added factor of utilization of well-child visits. We will use survival analyses to model these relationships. Study 2: An evaluation of the effectiveness of earlier FPDVs on the need for dental care at the first visit and the successful completion of treatment plans for Medicaid-enrolled children who sought care at a CHC in Iowa. Chart reviews will be used to find out how the needs of children at the time of their first dental visit and whether AFPDV affects outcomes, in particular, the completion of the treatment plan. The chart reviews will be performed at 9 Community Health Centers (CHCs) with electronic health records for 270 children in Iowa. Study 3: Impact of the AFPDV on future dental and medical care utilization and costs. Iowa Medicaid claims and administrative data will be used to determine if AFPDV affects future dental and medical care costs for preschool children. Using instrumental variable analyses we will model the factors related to dental use and cost with special attention to AFPDV. Study 4: Using the Health Belief Model and the Extended Parallel Process Model to determine factors associated with mothers' decision-making and preventive dental care seeking behavior related to FPDV. Focus groups will be used to help us understand what factors encourage and discourage parents from taking their children for preventive dental care. The results of these three studies will serve to inform the contents of a survey of parents with children in Medicaid. Previous results will help us to include the most critical factors and tailor the surveys to issues important to parents with children in Medicaid. These surveys will be designed to find out what prompts parents to take their children to the dentist for their first preventive dental visit and what might discourage them from preventive dental care. These data will be analyzed with OLS regression to determine what psycho-social factors are related to AFPDV. Goal: This program of research is designed to help us understand the most effective age for the first preventive dental visit. This work ultimately culminates in the design of an intervention with parents and providers to encourage the effective timing of children's first preventive dental visit. This study builds on extensive previous research by this team who has demonstrated the ability to successfully conduct studies regarding dental care for underserved children combining these large administrative databases and primary data collection methodologies.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research project will investigate the predictors and outcomes of preschool age children's first preventive dental visit, improving our understanding of how age at first preventive dental visit is affected by the psychosocial, behavioral, and social factors and affects the outcomes of dental care over time. We will use this information to design an intervention to encourage the appropriate timing of a child's first preventive dental visit through education of the parent and providers.               Relevance to Public Health This research project will investigate the predictors and outcomes of preschool age children's first preventive dental visit, improving our understanding of how age at first preventive dental visit is affected by the psychosocial, behavioral, and social factors and affects the outcomes of dental care over time.

"Understanding Sources of Children's Oral Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The purpose of this application is to empirically examine the influence of individual, family, community and state level characteristics on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in children's oral health and health care. The data will come primarily from the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH), conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is a population-based survey of approximately 102,000 children ages 0-17 years nationwide, including independent, representative samples of approximately 2,000 children from each state and the District of Columbia (DC). It will be augmented with state-level contextual variables derived from other sources. Multilevel modeling methods will be used in the empirical analysis. The three specific aims of this project are to: 1) Identify and quantify the relative contributions of individual, family, community, and state-level factors that explain disparities in children's oral health status and oral health care using the NSCH, thus furthering our understanding of oral health disparities, their sources and potential remedies; 2) Identify differences across states in children's oral health status and oral health care and the factors that contribute to those differences. Our goal under this specific aim is to identify mutable state-level factors (e.g., water fluoridation policies, state dental public health infrastructure, and availability of dental health professionals) that can lead to improvements in children's oral health and reduce disparities in oral health status and oral health care, and; 3) Establish a web based system using the NSCH database that augments existing systems and can be used by policy makers, researchers and advocates to compare and track children's oral health and oral health care disparities, including baseline data for each state and DC from 2003 and comparison data from the 2007 NSCH when it becomes available. We have established a working relationship with the federal MCH Bureau-CDC supported Data Resource Center to include our results on their website devoted to the 2003 NSCH (www.nschdata.org). This frequently used web resource will provide an excellent home for the data developed under this study. Accomplishing these specific aims will provide helpful information for dental care practitioners, families, federal and state health policymakers, and dental health services researchers concerning child, family and community level influences on oral health and oral health disparities. Our overarching goal in this project is to identify significant and modifiable factors that influence children's oral health disparities nationally and across states. This information can then be used to help guide federal and state policies to reduce disparities in oral health status and oral health care. Project Narrative: An overarching goal for HP 2010 is the elimination or reduction of health disparities in the US population. This proposal is responsive to that priority. It is also responsive to several components of the NIDCR Strategic Plan, including Goal 6 (eliminating health disparities in oral, dental and craniofacial diseases and conditions among underserved populations and groups) and Goal 7 (ensuring the adequacy of systems to document and monitor the extent and impact of oral, dental and craniofacial diseases, disorders and conditions). The diverse and cross-disciplinary study team proposed for this project is responsive to Goal 4 (supporting research infrastructure and enhancing the development of new approaches for conducting inter- and cross-disciplinary research).          ",Understanding Sources of Children's Oral Health Disparities,7686929,R21DE018523,"['Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Health Services ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Population Group ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Development and Testing of a Social Determinants Model of Oral Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite of recent overall improvements in oral health, oral diseases remain a significant public health problem in the US. To effectively achieve sustained and meaningful improvements, future interventions need to tackle the fundamental causes of oral diseases. Current biomedical and individualistic behavorial approaches fail to explain the underlying determinants of oral diseases. Based upon the Marmot Social Determinants Model of Health, this proposal aims to develop and test a new conceptual model for oral health. Secondary data analysis will be performed using data from NHANES (1999-2004) and other US population surveys. Clinical and subjective measures of oral health will be used, including counts of decayed teeth, tooth loss, periodontal disease, dental injuries, self-rated oral health and oral health related quality of life measures. Oral health related behaviours will include sugar consumption, dental attendance, smoking, alcohol, and tooth cleanliness. Regression analysis will be conducted to examine the relationship between health behaviours and oral health on the one hand and psychosocial, community and environmental factors on the other. Finally, the relationship between the clustered behaviors with oral health, and the psychosocial, community and environmental factors will be examined. Advanced multi-level analyses will be undertaken in addition to the regression models. This novel and innovative study will provide valuable insights into the underlying causes of oral diseases in the US population.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current biomedical and behavioral approaches fail to fully explain the underlying determinants of oral diseases.

The interdisciplinary team includes scientists trained in anthropology, biostatistics, dentistry, economics, medicine, psychology, and public health, supported by experienced project management and technology teams. The three initial projects focus on caries and periodontal disease, and intervene by extending current services and their use as well as adding prevention services and oral health promotion. The first Research Component (RC1) tests an intervention with pregnant women/mothers of newborns on a Northern Plains Reservation, which is focused on the use of motivational interviewing in prevention of ECC. RC2 is a randomized clinical trial of two methods for treating periodontal disease in Southwestern American Indians who also have Type 2 diabetes mellitus. RC3 is a test of a service delivery intervention in which tribal/community members are trained to apply fluoride varnish and deliver personalized oral health education for 3-5 year old children and their parents enrolled in reservation-based Indian Head Start programs. A Developmental Research Program will offer opportunities to pilot work suggested by new investigators, by community participation and planning activities, and by preliminary results of major projects. A focus on dissemination will include activities aimed at increasing community awareness and influencing health policy. Considerable prior experience with the participating tribes and communities has shaped the CNOHR methods and approaches, and ongoing community participation in planning will continue to influence the implementation of the RCs. A robust program of training and career development experiences will include mentoring and support for students at the secondary, undergraduate, professional and graduate, and post-doctoral levels, with emphasis on recruiting AI/AN investigators to oral health disparities research.     ",Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR),7840718,U54DE019259,[''],NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,U54,2009,13103,0.273548267273214
"Northwest/Alaska/Hawaii Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Northwest/Alaska/Hawaii Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities at the University of Washington in Seattle focuses on tooth decay in children, because it is the major oral health challenge U.S. society faces. Tooth decay in preschool children is worsening. The Healthy People 2010 Midcourse Review found the country moving away from national targets for young children: 22% of children 2-4 years of age have tooth decay while the target is 11%. The research plan addresses disparities and inequities in access to dental care and to healthy teeth (tooth decay or caries prevention) for low-income and vulnerable mothers and children within a conceptual framework that specifies the ecological nature of disparity problems. The specific aims of the community-based multidisciplinary research plan are to: 1) Conduct human trials to evaluate the efficacy of interventions to prevent and treat dental caries in children and their caretakers; 2) Develop community-based research that translates existing knowledge and new information into technologies and interventions that will reduce disparities; and 3) Encourage and support developmental research that has the potential to lead to independent studies to address and reduce caries inequity in children. The Center includes the Research Program Administrative Center (RPAC), two major community based intervention trials focused on dental caries- Community-Based Intergenerational Oral Health Promotion In Rural America and Parent-Child Toothbrushing with 1000 ppm Fluoride Toothpaste to Prevent ECC-and a Statistics and Data Coordinating Center (S&DCC).

Further dissemination sites are in the Alaska bush, rural Hawaii and Washington State. Developmental research projects involve communities in rural Eastern and Southwestern Washington State and focus on school nutrition and the use of topical PVP-iodine and fluoride varnish in caries prevention. The Center also includes a training core to increase the cadre of oral health disparities researchers through clinical research training and mentoring for junior scientists, efforts to enhance the awareness of health disparities research in the predoctoral curriculum in dentistry and medicine, and increases the numbers of minority and rural students entering dentistry and health sciences disciplines.    ",Northwest/Alaska/Hawaii Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities,7691276,U54DE019346,[''],NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U54,2009,1055142,0.25492248607980084
"Oral Health and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia in Older ICU Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NINR has recognized the importance of understanding risk factors for diseases, especially in areas where there are health disparities. Health and Human Services as well as the National Instituted of Dental and Craniofacial Research, through Health People 2010, have specifically identified oral health disparity as a key initiative. Pneumonia, the most common nosocomial infection in the intensive care unit (ICU), is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the ICU and has an associated high mortality risk for older ICU patients in particular. The subgroup of ICU patients, those who receive mechanical ventilation, are particularly susceptible to developing what is referred to as ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). Poor oral health has been linked to the development of VAP. Over the past thirty years, oral health disparities for the most vulnerable populations such as older patients, have been growing. The surgeon general's report on Oral Health in America declared poor oral health to be a ""silent epidemic"" especially in the poor, elderly, and racial and ethnic minorities. This predictive correlation study will be the first to examine pre-hospital oral health status as a risk factor for VAP in older adult ICU patients. Understanding the role of pre-hospital oral health in the development of VAP for older ICU patients will provide a more precise risk profile and greatly enhance the ability to establish targeted interventions for this vulnerable patient population. The training program outlined in this application will support me in my career goal as a nurse scientist by providing me with additional educational courses and experiences in the areas of oral health as well as clinical research. These courses and experiences will enable me to develop a program of research in this vital area and further my progress towards conducting nursing research.      Relevance of Research to Public Health: With the well known growth in the population of older adults and the increase in disparities in oral health care, many older adults are at risk for a lethal pneumonia acquired when they are hospitalized. This study will examine the oral health of older patients prior to being admitted to the hospital to help understand their risk for developing pneumonia while in an intensive care unit on a mechanical ventilator. Understanding risk factors will allow for the development of nursing intervention strategies, especially for older people who lack adequate oral health care.           ",Oral Health and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia in Older ICU Patients,7664062,F31NR011234,"['older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 6 year old ', ' six year old ', ' age 6 years ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' early intervention ', ' effective intervention ', ' patient population ', ' Correlation Studies ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Epidemic ', ' Preventive ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Prevention Protocols ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Affect ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Area ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' institutional infection ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Intubation ', ' Multi-Drug Resistance ', ' multidrug resistant ', ' multi-drug resistant ', ' Resistant to multidrug ', ' Resistant to multi-drug ', ' Resistant to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistance to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistance to Multidrug ', ' Resistance to Multi-drug ', ' Multiple Drug Resistant ', ' Multiple Drug Resistance ', ' Multidrug Resistance ', ' Americas ', ' male ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Nurses ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Research ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Patients ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Pulmonary Inflammation ', ' Pneumonitis ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Probability ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Mechanical Ventilators ', ' pulmonary respirator ', ' Respirators ', ' Pulmonary Ventilators ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' nursing intervention ', ' Reporting ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Gender ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Early identification ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Ventilator ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' cost ', ' ']",NINR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,40120,0.2416991607024073
"Center for the Biologic Basis of Oral/Systemic Disease (CBBOSD)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The link between chronic oral infections and general health has been recognized since the early 20th century. During the last 2 decades, retrospective epidemiological studies and prospective longitudinal, as well as intervention, studies have supported that these chronic oral infections with accompanying chronic inflammation associate with various systemic diseases and their sequelae. This continuation application for the Center for the Biologic Basis of Oral/System Diseases (CBBO/SD) addresses major initiatives of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) regarding improving oral and general health ofthe U.S. population. The CBBO/SD is organized into 3 cInical projects: Project 1: Chronic Inflammation at the Oral and Cervico/Vaginal Mucosa; Project 2: Physiology of the Stress Response in Patients with Temporomandibular Disorders and Fibromyalgia; Project 3: Coordinated Oral-Intestinal Immune Response in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; and 2 translational science projects: Project 4: Ontogeny of Innate Immune Responses at Mucosal Surfaces; and Project 5: Gene Therapy for Orofacial Pain. These projects enlist junior investigators from the Colleges of Dentistry, Nursing, and Medicine, as well as senior mentors/co-investigators from multiple colleges at UK. The thematic interface of the projects focuses on the contribution of chronic inflammation to oral and systemic diseases. They engage populations of expectant women, patients with chronic orofacial pain, and inflammatory bowel disease. These clinical projects interact with the translational projects at the level of a common understanding of innate immune responses and inflammation, and novel therapeutic intervention strategies forthe chronic orofacial pain. The CBBO/SD provides an infrastructure for development of the junior faculty by providing grants management support, educational opportunities, a biostatistics/bioinformatics core, and a clinical research center. The continuation of the CBBO/SD is supported by the success during the initial tenure of the center in transitioning junior investigators towards independent funding, coupled with substantial investment from the university and individual colleges.             ",Center for the Biologic Basis of Oral/Systemic Disease (CBBOSD),7941835,P20RR020145,"['Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', '

"University of Guam/Cancer Research Center of Hawaii Partnership (2 of 2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Oral cancer is the sixth leading cancer in the world, and ranks in the top three cancers in countries where betel nut (also known as areca nut) chewing is common. In Micronesia, a group of Pacific Islands where betel nut is frequently chewed, the risk of oral cancer is elevated, but quite variable across populations. For the period 1985-1998 (age-adjusted to the 1988 U.S. population), the prevalence per 100,000 ranged from 4.2 in Chuuk to 31.8 in Yap. In Guam, the incidence of mouth cancer per 100,000 population for the period 1997-2003, age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. population, varied between 8.1 for Chamorros to 17.9 among other Micronesians. The disparity in oral cancer rates among these populations may be due to differences in betel nut chewing patterns. To investigate the effect of chewing patterns, we must be able to conduct studies on multiple Micronesian islands with differing chewing patterns. Previously, we developed a comprehensive betel nut assessment protocol and a protocol for detecting oral lesions on Guam. The overall objectives of the pilot study are to further develop and test these methods, and to demonstrate that they can be applied in a research study of betel nut use on an island other than Guam. A convenience sample of 100 Micronesians (50 men and 50 women) who are long-term betel nut users (regular use for at least 10 years) will be recruited from the island of Saipan in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). We will collect data on betel nut use, presence of oral precancerous lesions, diet, demographics, anthropometry, medical history, and physical activity. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) collect information on betel nut use among study participants and other members of their families, 2) perform oral examinations, and biopsies, as needed, on study participants, 3) measure other health risks among this population, including obesity, high blood pressure, self-reported history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and unhealthy dietary practices and 4) examine associations of duration, frequency, and type of betel nut use with oral pre-cancers and with other health risks. This pilot project will help formulate the research methods for studying betel nut use and disease risk in Micronesia, and will provide the necessary preliminary data for a full multi-island study of betel nut use and the prevalence of oral lesions. Ultimately, a better understanding of these associations will provide important new directions for reduction of health risks through educational efforts and targeted intervention strategies.              ",University of Guam/Cancer Research Center of Hawaii Partnership (2 of 2),7939943,U54CA143728,"['Premalignant ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Research Center of Hawaii ', ' CRCH ', ' Process ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Age ', ' Grant ', ' Guam ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Area ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Physical activity ', ' Lesion ', ' Island ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Mastication ', ' chews ', ' chewed ', ' Chewing ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Micronesia ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Northern Mariana Islands ', ' Nuts ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Pacific Islands ', ' Peer Review ', ' Anthropometry ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Areca ', ' Oral Examination ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Oral ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Biopsy ', ' Training and Education ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' demographics ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' Institution ', ' oral lesion ', ' mouth lesion ', ' Data ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF GUAM,U54,2010,2010653,0.2111930028514738
"Development and Testing of a Social Determinants Model of Oral Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite of recent overall improvements in oral health, oral diseases remain a significant public health problem in the US. To effectively achieve sustained and meaningful improvements, future interventions need to tackle the fundamental causes of oral diseases. Current biomedical and individualistic behavorial approaches fail to explain the underlying determinants of oral diseases. Based upon the Marmot Social Determinants Model of Health, this proposal aims to develop and test a new conceptual model for oral health. Secondary data analysis will be performed using data from NHANES (1999-2004) and other US population surveys. Clinical and subjective measures of oral health will be used, including counts of decayed teeth, tooth loss, periodontal disease, dental injuries, self-rated oral health and oral health related quality of life measures. Oral health related behaviours will include sugar consumption, dental attendance, smoking, alcohol, and tooth cleanliness. Regression analysis will be conducted to examine the relationship between health behaviours and oral health on the one hand and psychosocial, community and environmental factors on the other. Finally, the relationship between the clustered behaviors with oral health, and the psychosocial, community and environmental factors will be examined. Advanced multi-level analyses will be undertaken in addition to the regression models. This novel and innovative study will provide valuable insights into the underlying causes of oral diseases in the US population.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current biomedical and behavioral approaches fail to fully explain the underlying determinants of oral diseases.

"Trends and Trajectories of Oral Health Among Older Americans:  The Role of Cognit    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral health is a critical but often overlooked component of health and well-being in older Americans. Compared to younger individuals, elderly people have an increased incidence and prevalence of oral diseases. Little is known about the patterns of oral health changes in late life at either the population or the individual level. In addition, few studies have examined factors, such as cognitive function, that may be associated with oral health changes. This study has the following specific aims: (1) examine and project racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in oral health trends among older Americans; (2) examine the intra- and inter-individual differences of change in oral health among older adults; (3) cross-sectionally analyze the relationship between cognitive function and oral health; and (4) assess the linkage between cognitive function and oral health among older adults by conducting longitudinal data analysis. This proposed research is innovative in several respects: 1) state-of-the-art analytic approach to analyses on population trends and projections, and individual trajectories of oral health; 2) examination of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in oral health trends and trajectories; 3) focus on individuals with a range of cognitive function (from individuals with potential dementia to cognitively normal); 4) examination of the linkage between cognitive function and oral health while controlling for other important covariates; and 5) use of multiple well-established datasets, including nationally and regionally representative samples, that are longitudinal or cross-sectional in nature, to compare and confirm the patterns and predictors of oral health across the various datasets. We expect our study to lead to a better understanding of the mechanism underlying oral health deterioration and its risk factors. And, in turn, our study may suggest strategies for effective and innovative practices to prevent oral health deterioration. As secondary data will be used, the proposed study is a very cost-effective way to accomplish our objectives.

"Oral Health and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia in Older ICU Patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NINR has recognized the importance of understanding risk factors for diseases, especially in areas where there are health disparities. Health and Human Services as well as the National Instituted of Dental and Craniofacial Research, through Health People 2010, have specifically identified oral health disparity as a key initiative. Pneumonia, the most common nosocomial infection in the intensive care unit (ICU), is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the ICU and has an associated high mortality risk for older ICU patients in particular. The subgroup of ICU patients, those who receive mechanical ventilation, are particularly susceptible to developing what is referred to as ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). Poor oral health has been linked to the development of VAP. Over the past thirty years, oral health disparities for the most vulnerable populations such as older patients, have been growing. The surgeon general's report on Oral Health in America declared poor oral health to be a ""silent epidemic"" especially in the poor, elderly, and racial and ethnic minorities. This predictive correlation study will be the first to examine pre-hospital oral health status as a risk factor for VAP in older adult ICU patients. Understanding the role of pre-hospital oral health in the development of VAP for older ICU patients will provide a more precise risk profile and greatly enhance the ability to establish targeted interventions for this vulnerable patient population. The training program outlined in this application will support me in my career goal as a nurse scientist by providing me with additional educational courses and experiences in the areas of oral health as well as clinical research. These courses and experiences will enable me to develop a program of research in this vital area and further my progress towards conducting nursing research.      Relevance of Research to Public Health: With the well known growth in the population of older adults and the increase in disparities in oral health care, many older adults are at risk for a lethal pneumonia acquired when they are hospitalized. This study will examine the oral health of older patients prior to being admitted to the hospital to help understand their risk for developing pneumonia while in an intensive care unit on a mechanical ventilator. Understanding risk factors will allow for the development of nursing intervention strategies, especially for older people who lack adequate oral health care.           ",Oral Health and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia in Older ICU Patients,7945294,F31NR011234,"['Correlation Studies ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Epidemic ', ' Preventive ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Prevention Protocols ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Affect ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Area ', ' Nosocomial Infections ', ' institutional infection ', ' Hospital acquired infection ', ' Hospital Infections ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Intensive Care Units ', ' Intubation ', ' Multi-Drug Resistance ', ' multidrug resistant ', ' multi-drug resistant ', ' Resistant to multidrug ', ' Resistant to multi-drug ', ' Resistant to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistance to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistance to Multidrug ', ' Resistance to Multi-drug ', ' Multiple Drug Resistant ', ' Multiple Drug Resistance ', ' Multidrug Resistance ', ' Americas ', ' male ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Nurses ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Nursing Research ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Patients ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Pulmonary Inflammation ', ' Pneumonitis ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Probability ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Mechanical Ventilators ', ' pulmonary respirator ', ' Respirators ', ' Pulmonary Ventilators ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' nursing intervention ', ' Reporting ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Gender ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Early identification ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Ventilator ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' cost ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 6 year old ', ' six year old ', ' age 6 years ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' early intervention ', ' effective intervention ', ' patient population ', ' ']",NINR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,F31,2010,40324,0.2416991607024073
"Dental Biologics for Underserved Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities of oral health care are a significantly under-addressed area of health disparities. A substantial population, primarily those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged and of ethnic groups including Hispanics, African Americans and Native Americans, have alarmingly poor access to oral health care. Dental pulp is vascularized connective tissue in the central core of a tooth, and maintains homeostasis of the tooth as   a biologically viable organ. When caries or trauma involves dental pulp, endodontic therapies are indicated. In irreversible pulpitis, the dentist or endodontist extirpates dental pulp, and obturates the instrumented root canal with bioinert materials. A total of approximately 16 million endodontic procedures are performed each year in the United States alone. However, individuals of socioeconomically disadvantaged populations have little access to root canal therapy, and frequently have their infected teeth extracted. Whereas root canal therapy is one of the successful dental treatments, complications have been repeatedly documented in the literature.  Secondary infections due to coronal leakage or undetected accessory canals are not uncommon, and require re-treatment. A substantial amount of tooth structure is removed during root canal treatment, leading to increased incidences of tooth fracture. Root canal treated teeth are devoid of innervation and pulpal sensation,   and thus are deprived of the ability to detect secondary infections. Our preliminary data demonstrate, for the first time, that endodontically treated human teeth are recellularized and revascularized in vivo. Accordingly, the overall goal of this SBIR/Phase-I proposal is to develop biologically based approaches for dental pulp regeneration at a cost that is substantially less than the current root canal therapy and readily accessible by underserved populations who currently have little access to conventional root canal therapy.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This SBIR/Phase I project will address a substantial disparity in oral health care by developing novel therapies for dental pulp regeneration. A total of   approximately 16 million endodontic procedures are performed each year in the United States alone. However, current root canal therapy is an expensive dental treatment with alarmingly poor access by socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, and yet leads to de-vitalized pulp tissue. We have generated preliminary data to demonstrate that dental pulp regeneration can be realized in human teeth at a fraction of the cost of current root canal therapy. We propose to take advantage of the SBIR mechanism to develop biologically based, regenerative root canal therapy that is affordable and accessible by underserved populations.           This SBIR/Phase I project will address a substantial disparity in oral health care by developing novel therapies for dental pulp regeneration.

We propose to take advantage of the SBIR mechanism to develop biologically based, regenerative root canal therapy that is affordable and accessible by underserved populations.",Dental Biologics for Underserved Populations,7943136,R43MD005185,"['Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tooth structure ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth Fractures ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Adopted ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' Xrays ', ' X-Rays Radiation ', ' X-Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' Radiation, X-Rays, Gamma-Rays ', ' Side ', ' secondary infection ', ' Location ', ' Beryllium ', ' Be element ', ' Drug Formulations ', ' Formulation ', ' Biocompatible Materials ', ' biological material ', ' Biomaterials ', ' Biotechnology ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Surgeon ', ' Bone Transplantation ', ' Bone Grafting ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Cells ', ' cytokine ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Businesses ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Pulp Canals ', ' root canal (anatomy) ', ' pulp canal (anatomy) ', ' Root Canal ', ' Canalis Radicis Dentis ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Be++ element ', ' cost ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' Homing ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Biocompatible ', ' public health relevance ', ' regenerative ', ' operation ', ' Connective Tissue ', ' Dental ', ' Kinetics ', ' Knee joint ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Medicine ', ' Edentulous Mouth ', ' edentulous ', ' Native Americans ', ' Letters ', ' Intellectual Property ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants, Including Bone Marrow for DCT ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Clinical, Transplantation, Organ ', ' Patients ', ' scaffold ', ' scaffolding ', ' Pulpitis ', ' pulpal neurogenic inflammation ', ' Endodontic Inflammation ', ' instrument ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Regeneration ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Root Canal Therapy ', ' root canal surgery ', ' Science ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Technology ', ' Temporomandibular Joint ', ' TMJ ', ' Mandibular joint ', ' Jaw Joint ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Cementum ', ' Cementum ', ' Dental Enamel ', ' tooth enamel ', ' Enamel ', ' Dental Implants ', ' Dental Pulp ', ' pulp ', ' Dentin ', ' Dentists ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Elements ', ' Endodontics ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Connective and Soft Tissue ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Extravasation ', ' Spillage ', ' Leakage ', ' Faculty ', ' Gel ', ' Prosthesis ', ' Prosthetics ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' Organ ', ' Goals ', ' Microscope ', ' Growth Factor ', ' Proteins Growth Factors ', ' Growth Substances ', ' Growth Agents ', ' GFAC ', ' Procedures ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Incidence ', ' nerve supply ', ' innervation ', ' ']",NIMHD,"INNOVATIVE ELEMENTS, LLC",R43,2010,200000,0.1696968062868245
"University of Guam/Cancer Research Center of Hawaii Partnership (1 of 2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Oral cancer is the sixth leading cancer in the world, and ranks in the top three cancers in countries where betel nut (also known as areca nut) chewing is common. In Micronesia, a group of Pacific Islands where betel nut is frequently chewed, the risk of oral cancer is elevated, but quite variable across populations. For the period 1985-1998 (age-adjusted to the 1988 U.S. population), the prevalence per 100,000 ranged from 4.2 in Chuuk to 31.8 in Yap. In Guam, the incidence of mouth cancer per 100,000 population for the period 1997-2003, age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. population, varied between 8.1 for Chamorros to 17.9 among other Micronesians. The disparity in oral cancer rates among these populations may be due to differences in betel nut chewing patterns. To investigate the effect of chewing patterns, we must be able to conduct studies on multiple Micronesian islands with differing chewing patterns. Previously, we developed a comprehensive betel nut assessment protocol and a protocol for detecting oral lesions on Guam. The overall objectives of the pilot study are to further develop and test these methods, and to demonstrate that they can be applied in a research study of betel nut use on an island other than Guam. A convenience sample of 100 Micronesians (50 men and 50 women) who are long-term betel nut users (regular use for at least 10 years) will be recruited from the island of Saipan in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). We will collect data on betel nut use, presence of oral precancerous lesions, diet, demographics, anthropometry, medical history, and physical activity. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) collect information on betel nut use among study participants and other members of their families, 2) perform oral examinations, and biopsies, as needed, on study participants, 3) measure other health risks among this population, including obesity, high blood pressure, self-reported history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and unhealthy dietary practices and 4) examine associations of duration, frequency, and type of betel nut use with oral pre-cancers and with other health risks. This pilot project will help formulate the research methods for studying betel nut use and disease risk in Micronesia, and will provide the necessary preliminary data for a full multi-island study of betel nut use and the prevalence of oral lesions. Ultimately, a better understanding of these associations will provide important new directions for reduction of health risks through educational efforts and targeted intervention strategies.              ",University of Guam/Cancer Research Center of Hawaii Partnership (1 of 2),7939681,U54CA143727,[''],NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,U54,2010,1154804,0.2111930028514738
"Health literacy and oral health status of African refugees    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Refugees often arrive in the United States (U.S.) with unmet health needs and significant barriers to care related to linguistic and cultural access. In particular, oral health problems have been identified as the most common health problem of newly arrived refugee children and second most common among refugee adults. Oral health disparities seen among U.S. populations are therefore also likely to be common among refugees and similar immigrant populations entering the U.S. From 1995 - 2005, 21,868 total refugees entered Massachusetts from an increasingly diverse array of countries, particularly in Africa. Most recent refugees from Africa in Massachusetts arrive with rudimentary English literacy skills. While low health literacy contributes significantly to poor oral health status in the U.S., its relationship with oral health status among refugees is unclear. In previous research, we have found that on arrival in the U.S., African refugees have less tooth decay than other refugees while still having high rates of other oral health problems such as gingivitis. Very little is known about how refugees' English literacy levels affect oral health status over time in the U.S. Lastly, it is unclear to what extent refugees' oral health problems improve, persist, or worsen once in the U.S. These findings and issues suggest the need to evaluate the impact of health literacy on oral health outcomes among refugees and immigrants. Therefore, the investigators propose to use mixed quantitative and qualitative methods in a cross-sectional study of newly arrived Somali refugees to determine the relationship between basic English language literacy and oral health status. They hypothesize that increased English literacy may lead to better oral health status independently of the adoption of Western cultural and social factors affecting oral health status, i.e. acculturation. The study will evaluate the impact of English functional health literacy on oral screening examination findings, experience with dental care, and perceptions and knowledge of other key factors that are known to impact on oral health status. Qualitative assessments will focus on experiences with resettlement, oral health, and literacy/education as well as the role of life stressors in determining oral health practices. Findings subsequently may be used to help design culturally acceptable preventive services and public health interventions directed at refugees and immigrants in the U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: No previous study has investigated the relationships between literacy, acculturation, and oral health clinical outcomes among refugees. This study represents an important opportunity to define these relationships and identify areas in which preventive oral health interventions may be directed. Preventive oral health interventions directed toward the growing immigrant and refugee populations in the U.S. will be important for reducing oral health disparities and their associated personal and societal costs for these communities and the larger U.S. population.          ",Health literacy and oral health status of African refugees,7806378,R01DE017716,"['literacy ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Immigrant ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Perception ', ' instrument ', ' Refugees ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' English Language ', ' Somalia ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Writing ', ' Oral ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Behavior ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Services ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communications Media ', ' Forms of Communication ', ' Communities ', ' functional health literacy ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' social science research ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Performance at work ', ' work performance ', ' job performance ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Preventive ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Improve Access ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Gingivitis ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hygiene ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Information Services ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Dental ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' African ', ' ']",NIDCR,MASSACHUSETTS STATE DEPT OF PUB HEALTH,R01,2010,514306,0.2535505001294066
"Causal Mediation Analysis of Dental Caries in VLBW and BPD Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Very low birth weight (VLBW) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are significant health issues which are also risk factors for oral health disease, including dental caries. In addition, VLBW/BPD is associated both with enamel defects, a biological risk factor for caries, and reduced cognitive development which may hinder the acquisition of healthy oral health behavior. Furthermore, both VLBW and BPD disproportionately affect minorities and those with low SES. The relative contributions or `mediating effects' of the various biologic, cognitive/behavior and psychosocial factors to the incidence and progression of oral disease in VLBW/BPD individuals is poorly understood. We propose to develop a new approach to mediation analysis and to analyze data from a unique cohort study to help illuminate the relationship between VLBW/BPD and dental caries. Our data are from a study which collected dental caries, enamel defects and oral health behavior information on a cohort of 302 adolescents previously assessed on medical, cognitive, and psychosocial outcomes at birth and at eight years of age. We propose a flexible new statistical method which translates and elaborates a proposed causal diagram into a system of easily fitted generalized linear models. This general context will allow us to incorporate specialized models, such as the zero-inflated Poisson, for the DMFT/S and other dental caries outcomes. We use a potential outcomes framework to develop mediation measures which may be expressed as functions of parameters from our general model. An additional aim of our project is to conduct simulation studies to examine the bias and efficiency of our mediation effect estimators, with a focus on robustness to model departures. Our development and study of methods for mediation analysis will facilitate their broad applicability for dental health and other studies. By helping to illuminate causal mechanisms in the relationship between VLBW/BPD and adolescent dental caries, we also hope to contribute to the development of effective new intervention programs for these special needs children.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to learn about the reasons (whether they are biologic, oral health behavioral, or both) for the increased risk of dental caries among adolescents with very low birth weight (VLBW) and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Our specific goals are to develop new statistical methods to handle complex causal models and to use these methods to analyze data from a cohort of adolescents followed from birth. By understanding the mechanisms leading to dental caries in VLBW/BPD children, we can more effectively intervene to improve the oral and general health of these special needs children.           This project seeks to learn about the reasons (whether they are biologic, oral health behavioral, or both) for the increased risk of dental caries among adolescents with very low birth weight (VLBW) and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).

"Healthy Teeth Toolkit: An Innovative Software Tool to Help Public Health Programs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries (tooth decay), is the single most common chronic disease of childhood, affecting nearly 6 in 10 children in the United States. Poor oral health is epidemic among all children, but is especially severe among lower income children. Untreated, tooth decay has severe consequences to society and to the individual, resulting in pain that can interfere with school attendance, learning, and play. Poor oral health often continues into adulthood, and research shows linkages between poor oral health and heart and lung disease, diabetes, stroke, pre-term low birth weight. Community oral health programs (COHPs) are a key strategy for reducing oral health disparities, primarily through disease prevention, increasing access to care and policy development. Unfortunately these programs cannot readily quantify the results of their activities and researchers lack data to publish evidence-based solutions to influence practitioners and policymakers. This Phase I proposal seeks funding to identify the information that dental public health practitioners and researchers need to improve programs and policies for reducing the high rate of dental decay in low income children. It will determine the merit and feasibility of developing a solution for these groups based on the existing OHS Prototype HTT e-tool kit database, currently used by a limited number of representative COHPs. In order to accomplish this goal, OHS will determine: The current information tools and data collection needs of a broad range of COHPs; the tools and data collection needs of researchers, policy experts and funders; the suitability of the existing Prototype HTT e-tool kit database to meet the identified needs of COHPs researchers, policy experts and funders; and the feasibility of developing a commercial version of the HTT that meets the identified needs of COHPs  researchers, policy experts and funders. With established feasibility, the information determined will be used to create the specification for a commercial software product, the Healthy Teeth Toolkit (HTT) to be built in Phase 2, that will capture the information that the dental public health field requires and that will have broad appeal among community-based oral health programs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health stated that ""The public health infrastructure for oral health is insufficient to address the needs of disadvantaged groups."" Community-based oral health programs (COHPs) are the primary strategy for expanding capacity to serve these vulnerable populations.

"Addressing Oral Health Disparities in Medicaid-Enrolled Special Needs Children wi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed application for a K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award is being submitted by Donald Chi, a dentist with advanced clinical training in pediatric dentistry and dental public health. Dr. Chi is currently a PhD candidate in Oral Health Services Research at the University of Iowa. This award will allow Dr. Chi to meet his long-term goal of becoming an independently-funded clinician scholar with an interdisciplinary research program that addresses disparities in oral health and access to dental care for children with special health care needs. His immediate career goal is to extend his dissertation research on access to dental care for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition by developing, testing, and refining a new multi-level conceptual model on access. Dr. Chi proposes the following five aims related to his career development: (1) improve conceptual understanding of access to care for low-income children with special needs; (2) learn and apply new discipline- and theory-based research methods; (3) collect pilot data for a future R01 application; (4) improve writing skills and professional networks; and (5) develop mentorship skills. In addition, he will test the central hypothesis of the proposed research plan - that the health care system-, community-, provider-, family-, and child-level determinants of access to dental care are complex, interrelated, and vary in relative importance depending on type of access being examined - through the following three research aims: (1) identify the multi-level determinants of access to dental care for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition using administrative data; (2) evaluate the extent to which behavioral factors are associated with access to dental care for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition using survey data; and (3) assess the relationship between access to dental care and the level of unmet dental need for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition using clinical data. This research will guide future studies on access and help in the development of multi-level interventions that will improve the oral health of Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition. The proposed career development and research activities will take place in highly supportive, research-intensive environments. Peter Milgrom, DDS and Colleen Huebner, PhD, national experts in their respective fields and Directors of the Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities at the University of Washington School of Dentistry, will supervise Dr. Chi's research and career development activities. In addition, Dr. Chi will receive consulting advice from John Neff, MD (co-developer of Clinical Risk Grouping software); Lloyd Mancl, PhD (biostatistician); and Elizabeth Momany, PhD (Iowa Medicaid data expert). Finally, all activities will be overseen by an External Advisory Committee consisting of Jeffrey Murray, MD (Professor of Pediatrics, University of Iowa); Peter Damiano, DDS, MPH (Professor of Preventive and Community Dentistry, University of Iowa); and Diane Martin, PhD (Professor of Health Services, University of Washington). This cross-institutional, interdisciplinary mentorship team will facilitate Dr. Chi's natural progression from current research experiences to the mentored clinical scientist development phase and then to independence.      Public Health Relevance: There is a dearth of research on access to dental care for publicly-insured children with special health care needs.

"Sociodemographic, Biosocial and Behavioral Mechanisms Linked to Earlier Oral Agin    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this project is to develop a biopsychosocial model that explains how sociodemographic, biosocial, behavioral factors interact with one another to lead to differential oral health in later life. Oral aging indicators examined in this project include tooth count, tooth decay, periodontal disease, and oral symptoms such as dry mouth and difficulty chewing foods. We will examine the effect on oral aging of the proposed mechanisms including race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health care use and availability, chronic health conditions, psychological and cognitive characteristics, and biological risk factors. We will specifically examine the age patterns of the relationship between oral health and various biopsychosocial factors in order to understand the evidence of earlier aging manifested by the higher presence at a given age of oral health problems in some subgroups of the population such as the poor and members of some racial and ethnic minority groups. We are particularly interested in looking at the link between some biological risk factors and oral health including indicators of inflammatory, immune and metabolic system processes, and bone density. This project will use the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2006, and 1988-1994 for mortality-linked analyses and analyses with CMV. NHANES-mortality linked data set will allow us to develop healthy life expectancy based on oral health indicators such as years of life without periodontal disease and years of life with natural teeth. A rich set of examined dental measures and potential mechanisms including biomarkers measured in NHANES provides an unparalleled opportunity to systematically and comprehensively study how mechanisms interact with one another to produce oral health and how some groups of our population get to poorer oral health outcomes, which can be an indicator of earlier aging.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is important to understand how demographic, socioeconomic, psychological, medical and biological factors interact to produce oral health disparities across population subgroups in the United States. Better understanding the mediating factors and their interactions would not only help reduce the disparities of oral health among different populations, but it would also help provide strategies to improve oral health status. In addition, given that oral health status can be related to major chronic conditions related to aging, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoporosis, it is important to understand interacting mechanisms by which oral health care and other medical care can be coordinated to improve overall health status.              7.

"Longitudinal Study of Dental Caries in VLBW Infants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This longitudinal study addresses the relationship between birth weight and early childhood caries (ECC) in a cohort of pre-term very low birth weight (VLBW) and full-term normal birth weight (NBW) infants. VLBW and ECC disproportionately affects poor and minority children costing Medicaid billions of dollars annually for treatment. The improved survival of VLBW children has resulted in greater long-term disabilities and need for health services, thus classifying them as children with special health care needs. The oral health needs of VLBW children have not been adequately studied. VLBW children are known to have a high prevalence of enamel defects in the primary dentition, which in turn can lead to increased susceptibility to ECC. Socio- behavioral factors that can predispose some children to ECC are unknown in VLBW children. Therefore the primary aims of the study are to (1) assess the incidence of ECC in VLBW and NBW infants; (2) assess mediators such as the incidence of developmental enamel defects, S.mutans infection and the extent of oral health behaviors in VLBW and NEW infants; (3) assess the indirect relationship between birth weight and ECC via mediators after controlling for independent moderating variables. A total of 200 VLBW and 200 NBW infants will be followed at 8 and 18-20 months corrected age. The proposed study will collect data on caries (decayed and filled surfaces), mediating biological variables (enamel hypoplasia and opacity, S.mutans levels) and infant oral health behavior (feeding, diet, oral hygiene practices, and dental access), and independent variables (demographics, parent predisposing, enabling, need characteristics, dental behavior, biological and child medical factors). Data analysis for testing aims 1 and 2 includes the generalized estimating equations (GEE) models, and a two-stage structural equations model (SEM) for testing the role of mediators in aim 3. The sample size provide 85 to 99% power to compare the two groups in terms of the three study aims. The results of this study will provide critical data to address the knowledge gaps in taking care of VLBW children. The clinical implications include primary prevention, early diagnosis and treatment to prevent further susceptibility to dental decay. It is also of public health interest since interventions to target knowledge, attitude, beliefs, and oral health practices can be implemented in programs for special needs children, and there by improve both oral and systemic health.           ",Longitudinal Study of Dental Caries in VLBW Infants,7837716,R01DE017947,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Enamel ', ' tooth enamel ', ' Enamel ', ' Dental Enamel Hypoplasia ', ' Hypoplastic Enamel ', ' Enamel Hypoplasia ', ' Enamel Agenesis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diet ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Older Population ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Affect ', ' Dental General Practice ', ' dental practice ', ' Age ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Needs ', ' Alaska ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Survivors ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Infection ', ' Dental Insurance ', ' dental health insurance ', ' Periodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontia insurance ', ' Oral Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Surgery Insurance ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Dental ', ' disability ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Sample Size ', ' Perinatal Care ', ' Medicaid ', ' Medicine ', ' Collaborations ', ' Very Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' very low birth weight infant human ', ' very low birth weight ', ' VLBW (human) ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Parents ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Dental Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Streptococcus mutans ', ' S.mutans ', ' S. mutans ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Washington ', ' Oral ', ' Live Birth ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' interest ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Equation ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' early childhood ', ' mental development ', ' cohort ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Reporting ', ' Primary Dentition ', ' Deciduous Dentition ', ' United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ', ' Agency for Health Care Policy and Research ', ' AHRQ ', ' AHCPR ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' cost ', ' feeding ', ' Minority ', ' demographics ', ' ']",NIDCR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,413599,0.19483193891418546
"Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries is a very different disease than it was forty years ago. While caries is declining in general, caries rates in young children (ages 2-5) in the US have been increasing (US GAO, 2008). There is also increasing disparity seen with severe caries occurring disproportionately in the poor and disenfranchised. Notably, individuals living in selected areas of Appalachia have some of the worst oral health indicators in the U.S. The current proposal is a renewal of our ongoing project (R01-DE-014899) to identify factors contributing to the oral health disparity seen in northern Appalachia versus the rest of the nation. The guiding philosophy of our project has been and continues to be that developing strategies to address this disparity requires simultaneous study of multiple risk components (ideally within families) to determine their roles, interactions among them, and their transmissibility patterns. The long-term goal of our program of research is to determine why the Northern Appalachian population is at increased risk of oral disease so that targeted preventive interventions can be designed.  One of the most notable results from the first project period was that the disparity in dental caries is evident at an early age; the prevalence of total caries experience in 2 - 5 year olds from our Northern Appalachian study was 144% of the prevalence of comparable children in NHANES, with this disparity diminishing in later age groups. Importantly, we also identified genes in multiple categories (tooth structure, taste preference, and salivary proteins) that are associated with either increased caries risk or protection, sometimes showing different effects in different age groups and/or dentitions. Finally, our microbiological and genetic studies of S. mutans demonstrated extreme genetic diversity and showed that S. mutans alone is unlikely to be the sole caries risk factor; more likely, dynamic changes in the oral microbial ecology are responsible for elevated disease risk. Based on the cross-sectional results, we hypothesize that the mechanisms that lead to disparities develop within the first two years of life. Implicit in this hypothesis is the need to address these questions longitudinally among children before and during the time of greatest risk from three different perspectives:  psychosocial, genetic, and microbiological.  The aims of this renewal include development of a longitudinal study of dental caries development early in life by recruiting a cohort of pregnant women. We will then utilize both the data collected in the first project period, and new data from the longitudinal cohort to follow up the significant environmental, genetic and microbial results from the first project period.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite years of study and preventive dentistry, dental caries in young children has been markedly increasing. The goal of this study is to continue our program of studying oral health in Appalachia, in particular to investigate factors (behavioral, genetic and microbial) leading to the early development of dental caries.                                PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite years of study and preventive dentistry, dental caries in young children has been markedly increasing.

"Contra Caries: Preventing ECC Using a Promotora Model for Rural Latino Families    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R21 application is to support pilot work examining the acceptability and feasibility of a culturally-appropriate, rigorously designed, implemented and evaluated, trained community-based Latino lay health worker (promotora) educational intervention. This intervention aims to reduce oral health disparities due to prevalence of early childhood caries (ECC) in children in rural, Latino families. ECC, (baby bottle tooth decay or cavities) the most common infectious disease of childhood (Surgeon General 2000) and a major unmet health care need (Newacheck et al 2000), is highly prevalent among low- income, rural preschool aged children, especially those of Mexican-origin. The proposed study will occur in two stages. Stage 1 addresses development, refinement and acceptability of the program and evaluation methods to promotoras, participants and the community using focus groups and other qualitative research methods. The curriculum is guided by Social Cognitive Theory. Stage 2 addresses feasibility and fidelity issues by implementing and evaluating the promotora training and pilot interactive oral health education program for 100 parents of children aged 1 to 5 years in Salinas, CA, a predominantly Latino agricultural community. We aim to assess, via pre-test post-test changes (at completion of program and 3-months after completion), whether the proposed intervention program: 1) Increases parental understanding of the mechanism and consequences of caries, knowledge of effective preventive activities including the role of fluoride, and understanding and knowledge about oral health generally including access to and use of oral health professionals, 2) Increases parental knowledge, skills and sense of self-efficacy with respect to their role in affecting their children's oral health care at home, including where, when and how to enroll children for oral services. The direction and amount of change in parental knowledge, attitude, practices and self- efficacy will be assessed. Rigorous process and outcome evaluation strategies will be used. If, in addition to meeting the stated objectives, the program is acceptable to the community and its delivery feasible, then an RO1 will be written in the future to support the program with a larger sample of Latino families in a rural location as a randomized rigorously designed, controlled intervention study. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research involves a culturally-appropriate educational intervention focused on parents of Latino children living in a rural area. It addresses Early Childhood Caries (ECC), a major oral health disparity experienced by children under five years of age. The intervention aims to reduce the number of children with ECC through improving parental understanding of its causes, mechanisms, and preventive activities - particularly improved oral hygiene (tooth brushing). The intervention enhances parents' ability to assist and better manage children's oral health care behaviors.           The proposed research involves a culturally-appropriate educational intervention focused on parents of Latino children living in a rural area.

"Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early childhood caries (ECC) is the most prevalent chronic childhood disease in the U.S., particularly among economically disadvantaged, underserved children. We propose to continue our existing Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health (U54DE014251) and its efforts to understand, prevent, and reduce oral health disparities, with a focus on preventing ECC. The themes of our collaborative, community-based program are (1) to provide the high-quality evidence base for new methods to prevent ECC in populations experiencing oral-health disparities and (2) to identify the most effective dissemination methods for delivering fluoride varnish (FV), an efficacious preventive method. We will actively engage California communities and providers in two large-scale intervention studies utilizing randomized clinical trial (RCT) methodology, stratified by settings, to assess the effectiveness or clinical efficacy of different preventive methods on caries incidence and increment among low-income children. Using the RE-AIM framework, Project 1 will identify the most effective setting (medical, social service agency or dental) to disseminate FV to the greatest number of 1-3-year-old children. Stratifying on setting, a parallel groups practical RCT will be conducted in 24 community-based primary care clinics (CPCCs) from the UCSF primary care collaborative research network, and 24 California Special Supplemental Nutrition Programs for Women, Infants and Children (WICs). Each non-dental site (CPCC or WIC) will be randomized to a program of parental counseling and onsite FV application or to parental counseling and referral to a dentist for child's FV application. We will also compare two automated telephone counseling methods and utilize teledentistry approaches for blinded caries assessments. Project 2 is an intervention study to be conducted in dental and non-dental settings, both affiliated with Federally Qualified Health Centers near the US-Mexico border, to compare the relative caries prevention efficacy of four protocols in 3-6 year-old children: 1) parental oral-health counseling (C) alone; 2) C+ FV; 3) C+ fluoride-releasing, glass ionomer (Gl) sealants applied to primary molars, and 4) C+FV+ Gl. Our Administrative Core, Statistics and Data Coordinating Center, and Community Liaison Program will support our two RCTs and developmental projects. These endeavors, with other education and career development activities, will foster new investigators to increase oral-health-disparity research capacity.

"Dental Caries: Whole Genome Association and Gene x Environment Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dental caries (also known as tooth decay) remains the most common chronic disease of childhood. Although overall caries prevalence has declined over the last 40 years, dental caries in the primary dentition and mean caries rates in children ages 2-11 has increased markedly over the past 12 years. Childhood caries is a serious public health issue because of associated health problems and because disparities in oral health have led to substantially higher average disease prevalence among children in poverty and in underserved racial and ethnic groups. These issues are of such concern that in 2005, the American Academy of Pediatrics made children's oral health one of their top areas of focus, as it is for the majority of the NIDCR ""Disparities Centers."" Multiple factors contribute to a person's risk for caries, including environmental factors such as diet, oral hygiene, fluoride exposure and the level of colonization of cariogenic bacteria and host factors such as salivary flow. There are still individuals who appear to be more susceptible to caries and those that are extremely resistant, regardless of the environmental risk factors to which they are exposed, implying that genetic factors also play an important role in caries etiology. This conclusion is supported by studies in both humans and animals, with the most compelling evidence coming from studies of twins reared apart in which investigators found significant resemblance within monozygotic (MZ) but not dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs for percentage of teeth and surfaces restored or carious and estimated the genetic contribution to caries as 40%. Despite the strong evidence of a genetic component to risk for dental caries, there have been only a few studies of candidate genes in caries, and no published genome-wide scans. Therefore, the goal of this study is to perform genome-wide association (GWA) studies of dental caries with a large panel of SNPs (500,000 or more) in families and individuals ascertained through multiple US sites. There will be an initial GWA scan in samples from three sites (University of Pittsburgh, University of Iowa, and University of Washington), with follow-up studies in additional collaborating sites (University of Michigan and UCSF). Successful completion of this study will allow a better understanding of the biology of dental caries, and will lead to earlier identification of children at risk for dental caries, thereby allowing improved and targeted interventions.

"Building collaborative research infrastructure to reduce oral health disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses significant disparities in oral health among older low income and minority community dwelling adults residing in Central Connecticut by building critically needed, collaborative Community - University of Connecticut research infrastructure. Oral health is critical to healthy aging, affecting appearance, self worth and life satisfaction, communication and sociability, eating patterns and nutritional status, protection from environmental insults, susceptibility to infection and chronic disease progression. To reduce oral health disparities in these populations, we propose to address primary infrastructural gaps. These include limited clinical and community based geriatric oral health research in the UCHC dental school research agenda and a fragmented geriatric research community across the University of Connecticut Campuses; a disconnect between communities of the most vulnerable older adults with oral health needs, elderly service and advocacy organizations, and geriatric oral health researchers; limited coordinated effort to organize statewide and local data on oral health and needs of patients, providers and the public with their input; primary health care, dental providers' and community resident lack of awareness of geriatric oral health; and limited geriatric oral health curricula in the medical/dental school educational program. The development of a transformative Academic Health Center/community partnership in Connecticut, the Oral Health Research Strategic Alliance (OHRSA) will address these issues, support needed areas of research development and translational implementation in central Connecticut, integrate older adult community voices, and provide a model for broader geriatric oral health translational research and dissemination. OHRSA consists of representative from critical stakeholders, including the University of Connecticut School of Dental Medicine, School of Medicine, Institute for Community Research, North Central Agency Area on Aging, Connecticut Community Health Center organizations, the Cobb Institute (the research arm of the National Medical Association), the Connecticut State Department of Public Health and the Ct. Dept of Aging, Meriden Health Department and low income senior housing complexes in north central Connecticut. Application aims are to: 1) Build, expand and institutionalize OHRSA, 2) Support ongoing state and local efforts to collect data on geriatric oral health and service barriers. 3) Build, test, manualize and disseminate curriculum to support partnership research on geriatric oral health of low income and minority older adults, for a) dental/medical faculty and students at all levels, b) practice based clinical researchers, c) community oral health advocacy organizations and d) low income older adults in senior housing and other community settings. 4) Develop a 10 year strategic research agenda and short term study development plan. 5) Create sustainable transformative infrastructure to ensure implementation of this research agenda.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop, implement and sustain community linked infrastructure that will address oral health disparities among low income older adults living in senior housing complexes in North Central Connecticut.

"Secondary Analyses using Network Techniques to Identify Risk Profiles for Oral He    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral disease is still prevalent in many regions, especially Appalachia, burdened by poor healthcare access and lower socioeconomic levels. Most assessments of risk factors for oral disease focus on one or two organisms or behaviors. This inherently restricts our ability to look at the interactive role of multiple organisms and host genetics that lead to susceptibility for oral disease.  Current methods for assessing complex relationships with a large number of risk factors are unable to incorporate more than a few interactions for statistical evaluation. Alternate analytic methods are needed. Network analytic approaches are a promising way to assess high dimension data that may contain multiple interactions simultaneously.  The long-term objective of the current application is to assess networks of biologic factors, especially microbial organism and host genetic variation, and their role in oral health. This goal will be met by conducting secondary analyses of data from an oral health study being conducted in the Applachian region (COHRA) using network analytic techniques. Over 2000 COHRA participants have provided oral health outcome, microbial samples, and DNA for genotyping. Detailed caries and periodontal screening measures are available. Both culture and sequence data are available for microbial identification. Single nucleotide polymorphism data will also be available. This application will test for networks of risk factors (microbial and genetic) and provide insight into what risk profiles may exist that correspond to oral health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Oral health and disease are the result of complex interactions between biologic and environmental factors. Current analyses do not account for these networks of relationships. We propose to evaluate microbial and genetic data obtained from Appalachian subjects using alternative analytic techniques in order to assess whether or not discernable biologic networks are present.

"Beverage consumption and early childhood caries trends    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite significant advances in the understanding of the caries process and in the interventions needed to prevent it, early childhood caries (ECC) remains one of the most prevalent diseases among children in the United States and the world. The main objective of this study is to determine if there is a relationship between increasing consumption of putative cariogenic beverages, such as 100% juice, juice drinks and soda, and the increase in ECC observed between the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1988-1994, and NHANES 1999-2004. We hypothesize that an increased consumption of these beverages, along with a decrease in milk intake between 1988-94 and 1999-2004 is associated with increase in the prevalence of ECC. We also hypothesized that cariogenic beverage consumption may contribute to the disparity observed in the prevalence of ECC among sociodemographic groups. The specific aims of this study are Aim 1: To determine if the strength of the association between caries and cariogenic beverage consumption among preschool children has changed between NHANES III and NHANES 99-04. Aim 2: To determine among socioeconomic groups of preschoolers if the strength of the association between caries and cariogenic beverage consumption has changed between NHANES III and NHANES 99-04. Aim 3: To identify beverages that may modify the association between cariogenic beverages and caries among preschool children in NHANES III and NHANES 99-04 and to determine if their consumption has changed between the 2 surveys. To achieve these specific aims data for children 2-6 years of age from NHANES III and from NHANES 1999-2004 will be analyzed. Data on beverage consumption and dental caries will be modeled with sociodemographic characteristics using Poisson and logistic regressions. Finding associations between beverage consumption and caries may suggest reasons for the lack of reduction in ECC, and will provide support for targeted dietary educational programs.

"University of Guam/Cancer Research Center of Hawaii Partnership (1 of 2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Oral cancer is the sixth leading cancer in the world, and ranks in the top three cancers in countries where betel nut (also known as areca nut) chewing is common. In Micronesia, a group of Pacific Islands where betel nut is frequently chewed, the risk of oral cancer is elevated, but quite variable across populations. For the period 1985-1998 (age-adjusted to the 1988 U.S. population), the prevalence per 100,000 ranged from 4.2 in Chuuk to 31.8 in Yap. In Guam, the incidence of mouth cancer per 100,000 population for the period 1997-2003, age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. population, varied between 8.1 for Chamorros to 17.9 among other Micronesians. The disparity in oral cancer rates among these populations may be due to differences in betel nut chewing patterns. To investigate the effect of chewing patterns, we must be able to conduct studies on multiple Micronesian islands with differing chewing patterns. Previously, we developed a comprehensive betel nut assessment protocol and a protocol for detecting oral lesions on Guam. The overall objectives of the pilot study are to further develop and test these methods, and to demonstrate that they can be applied in a research study of betel nut use on an island other than Guam. A convenience sample of 100 Micronesians (50 men and 50 women) who are long-term betel nut users (regular use for at least 10 years) will be recruited from the island of Saipan in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). We will collect data on betel nut use, presence of oral precancerous lesions, diet, demographics, anthropometry, medical history, and physical activity. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) collect information on betel nut use among study participants and other members of their families, 2) perform oral examinations, and biopsies, as needed, on study participants, 3) measure other health risks among this population, including obesity, high blood pressure, self-reported history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and unhealthy dietary practices and 4) examine associations of duration, frequency, and type of betel nut use with oral pre-cancers and with other health risks. This pilot project will help formulate the research methods for studying betel nut use and disease risk in Micronesia, and will provide the necessary preliminary data for a full multi-island study of betel nut use and the prevalence of oral lesions. Ultimately, a better understanding of these associations will provide important new directions for reduction of health risks through educational efforts and targeted intervention strategies.              ",University of Guam/Cancer Research Center of Hawaii Partnership (1 of 2),8144958,U54CA143727,"['Cancer Research Center of Hawaii ', ' CRCH ', ' Guam ', ' Universities ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,U54,2010,200000,0.2111930028514738

She will lead the Research Program Administrative Center (RPAC). Dr. Spero Manson, PhD, Professor and Head, AIANP, and a medical anthropologist, will serve as Co-Investigator and lead the Community Liaison and Dissemination Core within RPAC. Biostatistician William Henderson, PhD, Professor, Colorado Health Outcomes Program, will lead the Statistics and Data Coordinating Center (S&DCC). CNOHR takes a comprehensive approach to oral health disparities in the long term, with an initial focus on oral infections and key roles of behavioral factors and comorbidities. The interdisciplinary team includes scientists trained in anthropology, biostatistics, dentistry, economics, medicine, psychology, and public health, supported by experienced project management and technology teams. The three initial projects focus on caries and periodontal disease, and intervene by extending current services and their use as well as adding prevention services and oral health promotion. The first Research Component (RC1) tests an intervention with pregnant women/mothers of newborns on a Northern Plains Reservation, which is focused on the use of motivational interviewing in prevention of ECC. RC2 is a randomized clinical trial of two methods for treating periodontal disease in Southwestern American Indians who also have Type 2 diabetes mellitus. RC3 is a test of a service delivery intervention in which tribal/community members are trained to apply fluoride varnish and deliver personalized oral health education for 3-5 year old children and their parents enrolled in reservation-based Indian Head Start programs. A Developmental Research Program will offer opportunities to pilot work suggested by new investigators, by community participation and planning activities, and by preliminary results of major projects. A focus on dissemination will include activities aimed at increasing community awareness and influencing health policy. Considerable prior experience with the participating tribes and communities has shaped the CNOHR methods and approaches, and ongoing community participation in planning will continue to influence the implementation of the RCs. A robust program of training and career development experiences will include mentoring and support for students at the secondary, undergraduate, professional and graduate, and post-doctoral levels, with emphasis on recruiting AI/AN investigators to oral health disparities research.     ",Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR),7837735,U54DE019259,[''],NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,U54,2010,3584391,0.273548267273214
"Northwest/Alaska/Hawaii Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Northwest/Alaska/Hawaii Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities at the University of Washington in Seattle focuses on tooth decay in children, because it is the major oral health challenge U.S. society faces. Tooth decay in preschool children is worsening. The Healthy People 2010 Midcourse Review found the country moving away from national targets for young children: 22% of children 2-4 years of age have tooth decay while the target is 11%. The research plan addresses disparities and inequities in access to dental care and to healthy teeth (tooth decay or caries prevention) for low-income and vulnerable mothers and children within a conceptual framework that specifies the ecological nature of disparity problems. The specific aims of the community-based multidisciplinary research plan are to: 1) Conduct human trials to evaluate the efficacy of interventions to prevent and treat dental caries in children and their caretakers; 2) Develop community-based research that translates existing knowledge and new information into technologies and interventions that will reduce disparities; and 3) Encourage and support developmental research that has the potential to lead to independent studies to address and reduce caries inequity in children. The Center includes the Research Program Administrative Center (RPAC), two major community based intervention trials focused on dental caries- Community-Based Intergenerational Oral Health Promotion In Rural America and Parent-Child Toothbrushing with 1000 ppm Fluoride Toothpaste to Prevent ECC-and a Statistics and Data Coordinating Center (S&DCC). Primary research program sites include 12 rural county health departments in the State of Oregon serving whites and Latinos, a training center in Klamath County Oregon, and large Community Health Centers serving minority communities in Woodburn, Oregon (Salud Medical Center, Latinos) and Waianae Coast, Hawaii (Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders). Further dissemination sites are in the Alaska bush, rural Hawaii and Washington State. Developmental research projects involve communities in rural Eastern and Southwestern Washington State and focus on school nutrition and the use of topical PVP-iodine and fluoride varnish in caries prevention. The Center also includes a training core to increase the cadre of oral health disparities researchers through clinical research training and mentoring for junior scientists, efforts to enhance the awareness of health disparities research in the predoctoral curriculum in dentistry and medicine, and increases the numbers of minority and rural students entering dentistry and health sciences disciplines.

"Southeast Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A multi-disciplinary Center built on strong community partnerships is proposed at the University of Florida to foster research, dissemination of findings, and training on disparities in oral health. The initial theme of this Center is to reduce disparities in cancer survival by promoting early detection of oral and pharyngeal cancer (OPC) through two community-based theoretically-derived intervention projects. Community-based interventions built on strong theory are rare in oral health disparity research. A major strength of this application is the inclusion of an evidence base to support our research methodology. The first project will refine and upgrade health care providers' ability to detect early stages of OPC using evidence-based health education theory and the second will apply theoretically derived health promotion models to increase the likelihood that African American men obtain regular OPC screening exams. An R21-level project to validate a cellular biomarker related to susceptibility to squamous cell carcinoma is also proposed. The second theme of this Center is to apply community-based research principles gleaned from aforementioned work to follow-up projects that will address communities' oral health needs. One such R21-level developmental project will determine feasibility of conducting large scale preventive and treatment intervention in a well defined population of low-income minority children with aggressive periodontitis. It is expected that both R21-level projects will lead to full community-based interventions. This Center will facilitate oral health disparity research by 1) providing new resources through which multi-disciplinary teams jointly conduct targeted community-based intervention research; 2) strengthening the partnerships among researchers, clinicians, and the community; and 3) developing a pipeline of oral health disparity researchers and leaders. Our longstanding partnerships enable us to disseminate the results of our research such that we influence the dental/medical community, community members/patients, and policymakers alike. As proposed, the Center will produce a synergistic force resulting in a measurable reduction of disparities in oral health among the underserved. Community partners include the Alachua County Organization for Rural Needs (ACORN, a clinic to serve low-income rural and minority patients), Florida state dental organizations, Department of Health, faith-based community organizations (ACTION network and 4A's), and Florida A&M University, a historically Black College/University. The research conducted by the Southeast Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health (CRRDOH) will generate an evidence base that will affect public policy and will result in long term benefits for disadvantaged citizens.    ",Southeast Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health,7888278,U54DE019261,[''],NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,U54,2010,1574604,0.29085152574150813
"Developing a Computerized-Adaptive Test of Parental Health Knowledge    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tooth decay is the most common chronic childhood disease and a recent report from the National Center for Health Statistics indicates that the problem is worsening among preschool children. Furthermore, the burden of this condition falls disproportionately upon children from minority and low socioeconomic status groups. Good dietary and oral hygiene practices and use of appropriate dental services and treatments for both the parent and their child are essential to good oral health. To reduce the prevalence of tooth decay and other oral health conditions among preschoolers, it is critical that more parents become knowledgeable about the causes and consequences of major child oral health diseases and actions they can take to prevent them. Anticipatory guidance from pediatric providers remains an important source of information for parents. However, time constraints during clinical encounters and the unique information needs different parents have indicate that new strategies are needed to enhance the efficiency and the patient-centeredness of the anticipatory guidance process. Specifically, if short, precise measures are available to assess parents' knowledge across relevant content areas before an upcoming visit, parent-specific knowledge profiles can be generated to help clinicians tailor their guidance to parents' specific needs. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT), a measurement approach based on item response theory (IRT) in which items selected for presentation is adapted to the subject's ability level, could provide the basis for these short, accurate assessments. This project will develop a prototype for this knowledge assessment CAT system. Given the impact of tooth decay and worsening trend among young children, we will focus on developing an oral health module in this project. Other modules (e.g., in injury prevention and child development) will be developed in future projects. The proposed project will: 1) develop knowledge questions on child oral health; 2) evaluate questions for inclusion based on readability, understandability, clinical relevance and psychometric performance; and 3) develop an experimental CAT prototype and pilot test CAT score validity. Dental, pediatric and measurement experts will develop knowledge questions based on evidenced-based sources. Readability is assessed by evaluating reading level. Cognitive interviews with a socio-demographically diverse group of parents (N=48) will assess understandability. Clinical experts (dental and pediatric) will review items for clinical relevance, clarity and evidence base. Factor and IRT analyses will be used to examine psychometric performance. Preliminary validity of CAT scores will be assessed through simulation studies and known group tests (across parental health literacy and education groups). Data for analyses will be drawn from self-administered surveys of 350 primary caregivers of children recruited from two Washington D.C. pediatric primary care practices serving diverse racial/ethnic and socio-economic populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The high prevalence and worsening trend in dental caries and disparities in overall oral health observed for preschoolers highlight the importance of oral health as a major public health problem in children. Evidence of deficits and disparities in parental oral health knowledge indicate that educating parents about the causes, consequences and the preventive actions they can take could be an important first step to addressing this problem. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a series of adaptive parental knowledge assessment tests that can support providers in individualizing anticipatory guidance to the needs of parents and their children, which we hope will improve quality of care and outcomes for children.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Relevance: The high prevalence and worsening trend in dental caries and disparities in overall oral health observed for preschoolers highlight the importance of oral health as a major public health problem in children.

"First preventive dental visit: Disparities in needs, costs + behavioral insights    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses the broad challenge area: Health Disparities (09); Challenge Topic: Behavioral and Social Sciences to Reduce Oral Health Disparities (09-DE-101). Title: First preventive dental visit: Disparities in needs, costs + behavioral insights This study investigates the predictors and outcomes of age at first preventive dental visit (AFPDV) for Medicaid-enrolled children-a dentally underserved population. The age when a child receives their first dental check-up helps establish a dental home for the child and provides important preventive counseling for the mother. Medicaid-enrolled children are known to have less access to dental care. Of particular interest in this study are five Medicaid subpopulations at high risk of disparities in access to dental care and resulting oral health status: 1) Racial and ethnic minority children, 2) Rural children, 3) Children in federally designated Dental Health Professions Shortage Areas (HPSAs), 4) Children with less access to medical care and associated well child visits, and 5) Children who receive care at a Community Health Center (CHC). Since one in four children in the United States are enrolled in Medicaid, this study could potentially impact a large population of the most vulnerable children in the country. We are proposing a multifaceted, interdisciplinary set of studies to explore this issue: Study 1: Determinants of the age at first preventive dental visit for Medicaid-enrolled children. The first study investigates the predictors of age at first preventive dental visit using Iowa Medicaid claims data for preschool age children who were enrolled in the program within a month of birth in 2004. We will follow these children in the claims database until they have their first preventive dental visit, are no longer enrolled in Medicaid or turn six years old. Factors previously identified in dental use models will be included in these analyses with the added factor of utilization of well-child visits. We will use survival analyses to model these relationships. Study 2: An evaluation of the effectiveness of earlier FPDVs on the need for dental care at the first visit and the successful completion of treatment plans for Medicaid-enrolled children who sought care at a CHC in Iowa. Chart reviews will be used to find out how the needs of children at the time of their first dental visit and whether AFPDV affects outcomes, in particular, the completion of the treatment plan. The chart reviews will be performed at 9 Community Health Centers (CHCs) with electronic health records for 270 children in Iowa. Study 3: Impact of the AFPDV on future dental and medical care utilization and costs. Iowa Medicaid claims and administrative data will be used to determine if AFPDV affects future dental and medical care costs for preschool children. Using instrumental variable analyses we will model the factors related to dental use and cost with special attention to AFPDV. Study 4: Using the Health Belief Model and the Extended Parallel Process Model to determine factors associated with mothers' decision-making and preventive dental care seeking behavior related to FPDV. Focus groups will be used to help us understand what factors encourage and discourage parents from taking their children for preventive dental care. The results of these three studies will serve to inform the contents of a survey of parents with children in Medicaid. Previous results will help us to include the most critical factors and tailor the surveys to issues important to parents with children in Medicaid. These surveys will be designed to find out what prompts parents to take their children to the dentist for their first preventive dental visit and what might discourage them from preventive dental care. These data will be analyzed with OLS regression to determine what psycho-social factors are related to AFPDV. Goal: This program of research is designed to help us understand the most effective age for the first preventive dental visit. This work ultimately culminates in the design of an intervention with parents and providers to encourage the effective timing of children's first preventive dental visit. This study builds on extensive previous research by this team who has demonstrated the ability to successfully conduct studies regarding dental care for underserved children combining these large administrative databases and primary data collection methodologies.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research project will investigate the predictors and outcomes of preschool age children's first preventive dental visit, improving our understanding of how age at first preventive dental visit is affected by the psychosocial, behavioral, and social factors and affects the outcomes of dental care over time. We will use this information to design an intervention to encourage the appropriate timing of a child's first preventive dental visit through education of the parent and providers.               Relevance to Public Health This research project will investigate the predictors and outcomes of preschool age children's first preventive dental visit, improving our understanding of how age at first preventive dental visit is affected by the psychosocial, behavioral, and social factors and affects the outcomes of dental care over time. We will use this information to design an intervention to encourage the appropriate timing of a child's first preventive dental visit through education of the parent and providers.","First preventive dental visit: Disparities in needs, costs + behavioral insights",7938720,RC1DE020303,"['Counseling ', ' Decision Making ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Provider ', ' Dentists ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Occupations ', ' health science profession ', ' Health Professions ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Iowa ', ' Evaluation ', ' Dental ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' Rural ', ' Parenting Education ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Medicaid ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mothers ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Parents ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Policy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Attention ', ' Work ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Country ', ' Behavior ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' parallel processing ', ' checkup examination ', ' checkup ', ' Check-up ', ' early childhood ', ' care seeking ', ' treatment planning ', ' Funding Agency ', ' Funding Source ', ' social ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Preschool Child ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Modeling ', ' parental influence ', ' parent influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' data collection methodology ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' cost ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' administrative database ', ' administrative data base ', ' 6 year old ', ' six year old ', ' age 6 years ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' public health research ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,RC1,2010,482492,0.1050949647902424
"Leveraging Opportunities to Improve Oral Health in Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Oral health is a matter of public health concern because it affects a large proportion of the population and is linked with general health status. Early intervention strategies to address oral health problems can prevent illness, diagnose serious conditions early, and maintain optimum overall health. The landmark publication, Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon General, highlighted a lack of awareness of the importance of oral health among the general public, and found a significant disparity between racial and socioeconomic groups with regard to oral health and ensuing overall health issues. Developing interventions to improve oral health for older adults is a particular challenge, given the complex set of causal pathways and delays over the life course that are involved. System dynamics (SD) is an approach and a set of conceptual tools that enables understanding of the structure and dynamics of complex systems. SD simulation models help policymakers assess the impact of different interventions to find those that may yield the greatest leverage in the short term and in the longer term. We hypothesize that: (1) oral health in older adults is due to the lifelong accumulation of advantageous and disadvantageous experiences at multiple scales, from the micro-scale of the mouth to the societal scale that involves US federal policy, including lack of routine dental care coverage under Medicare; and (2) factors at the neighborhood scale (e.g., community access), interpersonal scale (e.g., oral health promotion), and individual scale (e.g., nutrition and chronic illness) may be particularly important in influencing dental health outcomes such as tooth retention, dental caries, and periodontal disease. It is critical to consider the complex relationships across all scales as is possible using SD conceptual tools to develop and implement interventions for older adults that cannot be gained by studying component parts in isolation. To address these hypotheses and leverage opportunities to improve dental health in older adults in Harlem and Washington Heights/Inwood, New York City, our specific aims are to: Aim 1: Build an SD model of factors affecting tooth retention in older adults using a group modeling process. (A) Refine our causal map through input from practitioners and policy scholars in oral health and aging. (B) Calibrate our SD model based upon the local population and local conditions in northern Manhattan. Aim 2: Evaluate the performance of our SD model to project the potential impacts of proposed interventions. (A) Produce a status quo simulation that assumes continuation of existing programs at current levels. (B) Examine the effects of alternative interventions involving, e.g., treatment and oral hygiene activity, on the prevalence and burden of tooth loss and other oral diseases using simulations from our SD model. (C) Compare the predictive performance of our SD model with regression models of dental health. Successful completion of these aims will aid in identifying interventions that are more effective and cost-saving than others, to provide policymakers with an indication of where scarce resources ought to be focused to improve oral health in older adults at the local level and at broader levels.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Developing interventions to improve dental health for older adults is a challenge, given the complex set of causal pathways and delays that are involved.

"Increasing Oral Cancer Screening by Dentists:Qualitative Research on Practitioner Age-adjusted (world) oral cancer (OC) incidence and mortality rates for Puerto Rico (PR) are among the highest in the Western Hemisphere. Early diagnosis of oral cancer will decrease the morbidity and mortality resultant from this disease and its treatment. The objective of Healthy People 2010 is to increase the percentage of oral and pharyngeal cancers (stage I, localized) detected at the earliest stage to 50%. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico appears to have a deficit in early cancer detection that is strikingly worse than the mainland U.S. We have reported an ¿inverse triangle¿ of invasive carcinomas to in situ carcinomas and premalignant oral cancer lesions, i.e., significantly more pathology sign-out diagnoses for oral cancer than the other lesion types. Thus, routinely including oral cancer examinations in clinical practice will detect both more pre-malignant and earlier oral cancers with the result of decreasing the morbidity and mortality in Puerto Rico. The long-term goal of this project is to strengthen secondary prevention of oral cancer by increasing the practice of head and neck examinations in dental practices in terms of the a) proportion of persons screened, b) the frequency of screenings (initial, recall exams), and c) the quality of the screenings. The Specific Aims are: 1) identify methods to change OC screening practice behaviors by dentists in Puerto Rico, 2) identify emerging technologies that will increase practitioner screening in Puerto Rico, 3) identify emerging social trends and activities that will increase practitioner screening in Puerto Rico , and 4) based on the findings from Specific Aims #1-3, define a pragmatic implementation strategy for increasing practitioner screening for oral cancer in Puerto Rico. To accomplish the Specific Aims, qualitative investigative methods (i.e., expert focus groups and key informant interviews) will be conducted to obtain the necessary data from Specific Aims #1-3 to allow accomplishing Specific Aim #4. Thus, culturally/professionally acceptable methods, technologies and activities can be developed that are recognized by the targeted group (dentists) as being acceptable as well as productive in increasing the frequency of oral cancer screenings. These objectives will be accomplished by an experienced multi-disciplinary research team. Significance: By focusing public health and professional activities on highly acceptable oral cancer screening dissemination and implementation operations that are based on the findings of this project, oral cancer morbidity and mortality will be decreased in Puerto Rico. An objective of Healthy People 2010 is to increase the percentage of oral and pharyngeal cancers (stage I,  localized) detected at the earliest stage to 50%. Puerto Rico�s deficit in early detection compared to the U.S.  makes it a sensitive site to measuring intervention effectiveness to increase early detection and decrease the  health disparity of PR, which has the highest oral cancer rates in the Western hemisphere.

"Trends and Trajectories of Oral Health Among Older Americans:  The Role of Cognit    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral health is a critical but often overlooked component of health and well-being in older Americans. Compared to younger individuals, elderly people have an increased incidence and prevalence of oral diseases. Little is known about the patterns of oral health changes in late life at either the population or the individual level. In addition, few studies have examined factors, such as cognitive function, that may be associated with oral health changes. This study has the following specific aims: (1) examine and project racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in oral health trends among older Americans; (2) examine the intra- and inter-individual differences of change in oral health among older adults; (3) cross-sectionally analyze the relationship between cognitive function and oral health; and (4) assess the linkage between cognitive function and oral health among older adults by conducting longitudinal data analysis. This proposed research is innovative in several respects: 1) state-of-the-art analytic approach to analyses on population trends and projections, and individual trajectories of oral health; 2) examination of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in oral health trends and trajectories; 3) focus on individuals with a range of cognitive function (from individuals with potential dementia to cognitively normal); 4) examination of the linkage between cognitive function and oral health while controlling for other important covariates; and 5) use of multiple well-established datasets, including nationally and regionally representative samples, that are longitudinal or cross-sectional in nature, to compare and confirm the patterns and predictors of oral health across the various datasets. We expect our study to lead to a better understanding of the mechanism underlying oral health deterioration and its risk factors. And, in turn, our study may suggest strategies for effective and innovative practices to prevent oral health deterioration. As secondary data will be used, the proposed study is a very cost-effective way to accomplish our objectives.

"State Policies and Children's Oral Health Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral health is critically important to children's overall health and represents the largest unmet health need for children. With the Surgeon General's 2000 report on oral health, there has been a growing awareness of the need to increase access to services and address racial/ethnic disparities in both service use and oral health status. Despite states' considerable efforts to address oral health and a few recent reports attempting to review selected state policies, little is known about the degree to which state policies affect children's oral health. The goal of the proposed study is to assess whether variations in state policies are related to children's oral health conditions and care utilization for children ages 1-17 years. The specific aims include: 1) To examine variations in state oral health policies in 2006. 2) To examine whether state oral health policies in 2006 are associated with state-level children's oral health and dental care utilization in 2007. 3)To examine whether state oral health policies in 2006 have an independent effect on children's oral health in 2007 after adjusting for individual child, family and state characteristics.  Data for the proposed study come from: the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH), the 2007 American Community Survey (ACS) conducted by the US Census, and from 2006 policy data compiled by the American Dental Association (ADA), the Children's Dental Health Project (CDHP), and the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors (ASTDD) in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). T-tests will be used to assess variations in the number and extent of state policies across states (Aim 1). Multivariable regression models will be constructed to consider relations between state policies with state- level oral health status and care use, conditioned on state characteristics (Aim 2). Multilevel regression models will be used to assess whether state policies have an independent effect on children's oral health after adjusting for individual child, family, and state characteristics. Age-specific policies will be examined for age subgroups (1-5, 6-11, and 12-17 years) (Aim 3).  The proposed work will be the first study to link state policies to service use and children's oral health status, which supports NIDCR's Strategic Goal 1 (objective I-2: to increase the Institute's commitment to basic and applied research in the behavioral and social sciences) and Goal IV (objective IV-1: to identify the full range of factors that contribute to oral health inequality).

"Hollywood Smiles    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The African American (AA) Gullah population has a higher rate of oral health (OH) disparities when compared to AAs nationally. OH disparities among this group can be attributed to several factors including fear, lack of trust in providers, past negative experiences, access to care and cultural beliefs. The proposed study will test the feasibility of a bundled, multi-level intervention, whose design is based on the preferences of the targeted rural Gullah population. If this study demonstrates feasibility we will broaden our recruitment for future R01 with other Gullah communities statewide. Our long-term partnership goal is to have a community clinic in Hollywood with MUSC dental students and faculty. This is a sustainable model where the students would be more engaged and exposed to treating the rural community and the community would have increased access and acceptable and relevant OH care. The aims of this project are to: 1. Develop a novel, community preferred OH multi-level intervention (Hollywood Smiles-HS) in church settings; 2. Evaluate the HS intervention feasibility including intervention dosage and fidelity as well as monitoring and measurement of target outcomes and cost; 3. Evaluate preliminary efficacy indications of the HS and estimate outcome measurement variability needed to calculate sample size for a subsequent study of intervention efficacy. A social-ecological model is proposed to guide the intervention, providing a framework for intervening at multiple levels of influence (individual, peer and organizational) on OH behaviors. Cluster randomization will be used to assign 2 churches to an intervention (HS) group (n=30) and a control group (CG) (n=30), thru a coin- toss procedure, for a total of 60 participants. All participants will receive primary standard of care dental therapy at a community dental clinic and transportation passes for each of the dental visits. Participants, members of the church in the HS group will also receive a 3-month multi-level intervention that will include 1:1 contact with a community OH promoter (COHP), peer educational sessions, and church level interventions. As specified by the aims and guided by the conceptual framework, the outcome measures will include: a) dependent variables of oral health; b) intervention mediator variables (oral health behavior report, oral health literacy, oral health self-efficacy and dental anxiety level); and, d) independent variables (demographic and physiologic measures) and church climate. A systematic process evaluation will be conducted and measures of feasibility will include recruitment, adherence (dosage/fidelity), dropout proportions, acceptability, Church Advisory Board satisfaction, and reach of the intervention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health relevance of this application relates to the use of a non-dental community oral health promoter to improve oral health literacy and access to dental care in their community.

"Reimbursing Medical Providers for Early Childhood Caries Preventive Services    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early childhood caries (ECC) is a significant national problem that disproportionately affects low- income children, and its prevalence is increasing. Because it is difficult to reach pre-school aged children for caries prevention, thirty-three state Medicaid programs have implemented reimbursement to medical primary care providers (PCPs) to provide early childhood caries preventive services (ECCPS). However, states report slow rates of uptake. Further, little is known about the child, provider, and community factors associated with the receipt of ECCPS and the effect on subsequent dental service use. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of PCP reimbursement on access to preventive oral health services in early childhood for Medicaid-enrolled children. Our central hypothesis is that these policies have improved access to ECCPS with variations in policy effectiveness based on child and community characteristics. To test our hypothesis, we will use secondary data provided by the Florida and Texas Medicaid programs to accomplish the following specific aims: (1) to compare receipt of ECCPS before and after PCP reimbursement and examine whether there are variations among particularly vulnerable subgroups of children, including children with special health care needs and racial/ethnic minorities; (2) to examine the impact of PCP reimbursement on access to ECCPS in high-risk communities, and (3) to evaluate whether receipt of ECCPS from a medical PCP is associated with an increased likelihood of seeing a dental provider. Secondary data sources include child-level longitudinal enrollment databases linked to claims and encounter data for children 0-3 years old enrolled in Florida and Texas Medicaid. Multivariable regression analyses and geographic information systems techniques will be used to evaluate policy impacts and variations by child and community characteristics. The proposed research will provide important information about how effective current policies are in achieving their objectives and whether there are variations in policy effectiveness among Medicaid subpopulations. This information is a critical first step in developing actionable strategies to improve the performance of ECC prevention programs and reversing the trend of increasing ECC prevalence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study promotes NIDCR Strategic Goal 4: Apply Rigorous, Multidisciplinary Research Approaches to Eliminate Disparities in Oral, Dental and Craniofacial Health and the Healthy People 2020 (proposed) goals to increase the proportion of low-income children and adolescents who receive preventive dental services (OH HP2020-4) and to reduce the proportion of children and adolescents who have dental caries in their primary or permanent teeth (OH HP2020-6). Specifically, this study examines the effect of medical provider reimbursement on access to early childhood caries preventive services and subsequent dental use among Medicaid enrollees.

"University of Guam/Cancer Research Center of Hawaii Partnership (1 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Oral cancer is the sixth leading cancer in the world, and ranks in the top three cancers in countries where betel nut (also known as areca nut) chewing is common. In Micronesia, a group of Pacific Islands where betel nut is frequently chewed, the risk of oral cancer is elevated, but quite variable across populations. For the period 1985-1998 (age-adjusted to the 1988 U.S. population), the prevalence per 100,000 ranged from 4.2 in Chuuk to 31.8 in Yap. In Guam, the incidence of mouth cancer per 100,000 population for the period 1997-2003, age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. population, varied between 8.1 for Chamorros to 17.9 among other Micronesians. The disparity in oral cancer rates among these populations may be due to differences in betel nut chewing patterns. To investigate the effect of chewing patterns, we must be able to conduct studies on multiple Micronesian islands with differing chewing patterns. Previously, we developed a comprehensive betel nut assessment protocol and a protocol for detecting oral lesions on Guam. The overall objectives of the pilot study are to further develop and test these methods, and to demonstrate that they can be applied in a research study of betel nut use on an island other than Guam. A convenience sample of 100 Micronesians (50 men and 50 women) who are long-term betel nut users (regular use for at least 10 years) will be recruited from the island of Saipan in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). We will collect data on betel nut use, presence of oral precancerous lesions, diet, demographics, anthropometry, medical history, and physical activity. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) collect information on betel nut use among study participants and other members of their families, 2) perform oral examinations, and biopsies, as needed, on study participants, 3) measure other health risks among this population, including obesity, high blood pressure, self-reported history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and unhealthy dietary practices and 4) examine associations of duration, frequency, and type of betel nut use with oral pre-cancers and with other health risks. This pilot project will help formulate the research methods for studying betel nut use and disease risk in Micronesia, and will provide the necessary preliminary data for a full multi-island study of betel nut use and the prevalence of oral lesions. Ultimately, a better understanding of these associations will provide important new directions for reduction of health risks through educational efforts and targeted intervention strategies.

"Increasing Oral Cancer Screening by Dentists:Qualitative Research on Practitioner Age-adjusted (world) oral cancer (OC) incidence and mortality rates for Puerto Rico (PR) are among the highest in the Western Hemisphere. Early diagnosis of oral cancer will decrease the morbidity and mortality resultant from this disease and its treatment. The objective of Healthy People 2010 is to increase the percentage of oral and pharyngeal cancers (stage I, localized) detected at the earliest stage to 50%. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico appears to have a deficit in early cancer detection that is strikingly worse than the mainland U.S. We have reported an ¿inverse triangle¿ of invasive carcinomas to in situ carcinomas and premalignant oral cancer lesions, i.e., significantly more pathology sign-out diagnoses for oral cancer than the other lesion types. Thus, routinely including oral cancer examinations in clinical practice will detect both more pre-malignant and earlier oral cancers with the result of decreasing the morbidity and mortality in Puerto Rico. The long-term goal of this project is to strengthen secondary prevention of oral cancer by increasing the practice of head and neck examinations in dental practices in terms of the a) proportion of persons screened, b) the frequency of screenings (initial, recall exams), and c) the quality of the screenings. The Specific Aims are: 1) identify methods to change OC screening practice behaviors by dentists in Puerto Rico, 2) identify emerging technologies that will increase practitioner screening in Puerto Rico, 3) identify emerging social trends and activities that will increase practitioner screening in Puerto Rico , and 4) based on the findings from Specific Aims #1-3, define a pragmatic implementation strategy for increasing practitioner screening for oral cancer in Puerto Rico. To accomplish the Specific Aims, qualitative investigative methods (i.e., expert focus groups and key informant interviews) will be conducted to obtain the necessary data from Specific Aims #1-3 to allow accomplishing Specific Aim #4. Thus, culturally/professionally acceptable methods, technologies and activities can be developed that are recognized by the targeted group (dentists) as being acceptable as well as productive in increasing the frequency of oral cancer screenings. These objectives will be accomplished by an experienced multi-disciplinary research team. Significance: By focusing public health and professional activities on highly acceptable oral cancer screening dissemination and implementation operations that are based on the findings of this project, oral cancer morbidity and mortality will be decreased in Puerto Rico. An objective of Healthy People 2010 is to increase the percentage of oral and pharyngeal cancers (stage I,  localized) detected at the earliest stage to 50%. Puerto Rico�s deficit in early detection compared to the U.S.  makes it a sensitive site to measuring intervention effectiveness to increase early detection and decrease the  health disparity of PR, which has the highest oral cancer rates in the Western hemisphere. This project will  identify practitioner accepted mechanisms that when applied, will increase oral cancer screenings and thus the  yield of early staged vs. latter staged oral cancers leading to decreased disease and treatment associated  morbidity and mortality.",Increasing Oral Cancer Screening by Dentists:Qualitative Research on Practitioner,8298304,R21DE019766,"['Academic Detailing ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pharynx ', ' Pharynx Cancer ', ' Pharyngeal Cancer ', ' Pharnyx Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Pharynx ', ' Malignant Pharyngeal Tumor ', ' Malignant Pharyngeal Neoplasm ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Squamous cell carcinoma ', ' Squamous Cell Epithelioma ', ' Squamous Carcinoma ', ' Planocellular Carcinoma ', ' Epidermoid Carcinoma ', ' Head and neck structure ', ' Head and Neck ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' informant ', ' Dental General Practice ', ' dental practice ', ' trend ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Intention ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Carcinoma ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Dental ', ' International Classification of Disease for Oncology ', ' ICD-O ', ' Screening for Oral Cancer ', ' oral cancer early detection ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Data ', ' Incidence ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Publishing ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Site ', ' patient expectation ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Goals ', ' Work ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' operation ', ' Clinical ', ' Research ', ' Visual ', ' Oral ', ' social ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Woman ', ' Detection ', ' Probability ', ' Age ', ' Premalignant ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Dentists ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Risk ', ' Visit ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Methods ', ' Staging ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' base ', ' Behavior ', ' Pathology ', ' Medical ', ' Lesion ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' experience ', ' Technology ', ' clinical practice ', ' Patients ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' United States ', ' Physicians ', ' Individual ', ' Reporting ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Measures ', ' Persons ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Interview ', ' Biopsy ', ' Accounting ', ' oral premalignancy ', ' oral precancer ', ' Oropharyngeal ', ' oral pharyngeal ', ' Oropharynxs ', ' Oropharynx ', ' Carcinoma in Situ ', ' in situ cancer ', ' Preinvasive Carcinoma ', ' Intraepithelial Carcinoma ', ' British ', ' Continuing Education ', ' Continuance of education ', ' ']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R21,2011,134760,0.1872656669002945
"Proof of Concept: Scardovia wiggsiae is Cariogenic in vivo    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While it has been demonstrated that Bifidobacteriaceae species are strongly associated with dental caries, there is limited information about cariogenicity of these species. The long-term goal of this research project is to reduce and ultimately help prevent early childhood caries (ECC). The objective of this R21 application is to prove/disprove the concept that Scardovia wiggsiae, which was detected as significantly associated with severe-ECC, is cariogenic in vivo. The central hypothesis is that S. wiggsiae will induce tooth demineralization and produce caries in vivo, acting either acting alone or in synergy with Streptococcus mutans. The rationale for this proposal is that proof of cariogenic potential in vivo would justify in- depth studies of the bacterium's relevance to human dental health, and if so, its cariogenic mechanisms. The central hypothesis and accomplishment of the objective of this application will be tested with the following two specific aims. Aim 1: Cariogenicity of Scardovia wiggsiae in vivo. The working hypothesis is that Scardovia wiggsiae will colonize and induce tooth demineralization in an animal model system. Differing concentrations of the organism will be used to inoculate Sprague Dawley rats fed a cariogenic diet. Animals will be tested for colonization and tissue invasion by S. wiggsiae, and scored for caries. Aim 2: Cariogenicity of Scardovia wiggsiae with S. mutans in vivo. Significant associations between children colonized by both S. wiggsiae and S. mutans and severe-ECC were detected. The working hypothesis is that a combination of S. wiggsiae and S. mutans will colonize and induce more tooth demineralization than either species alone. In Aim 2, the ability for separate infections by S. wiggsiae and S. mutans to induce caries will be compared with a combined S. wiggsiae and S. mutans infection in the same animal model used in Aim 1. Test species colonization and tissue invasion, and dental caries will be assayed. The expected outcomes in Aim 1 will be the demonstration of cariogenicity of a newly named species significantly associated with severe-ECC, and in Aim 2 demonstration of enhanced cariogenicity by the combined infection of S. wiggsiae with S. mutans. The expected confirmation that S. wiggsiae is cario- genic in vivo would have an important positive impact on the field because it would indicate the need for further investigation into the association of the species with diverse populations at risk for caries and determining mechanism(s) of cariogenicity on which to base future improved microbial diagnosis, risk assessment and treatment for early childhood caries. The research proposed is significant because it is expected to enable subsequent definitive studies at the R01 level based on the hypothesis that S. wiggsiae is a caries pathogen in humans. While this proposal stems from species association with severe-ECC, the findings will have direct application for studies of caries in adults including rapidly progressing coronal and root lesions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will prove or disprove the concept that Scardovia wiggsiae is cariogenic. If this species proves to be cariogenic, it would be of public health relevance to test it as a risk indicator for dental caries which would particularly benefit populations with oral health disparities that experience rampant/severe-ECC. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that is described in the priorities of the strategic plan of NIDCR (2009-2013) by integrating a molecular and clinical (in vivo disease model) approach to prove or disprove a diagnostic biomarker for caries risk (Objective I-1), and examining factors that could contribute to oral health inequality (Objective IV-1).               The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will prove or disprove the concept that Scardovia wiggsiae is cariogenic.

"Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early childhood caries (ECC) is the most prevalent chronic childhood disease in the U.S., particularly among economically disadvantaged, underserved children. We propose to continue our existing Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health (U54DE014251) and its efforts to understand, prevent, and reduce oral health disparities, with a focus on preventing ECC. The themes of our collaborative, community-based program are (1) to provide the high-quality evidence base for new methods to prevent ECC in populations experiencing oral-health disparities and (2) to identify the most effective dissemination methods for delivering fluoride varnish (FV), an efficacious preventive method. We will actively engage California communities and providers in two large-scale intervention studies utilizing randomized clinical trial (RCT) methodology, stratified by settings, to assess the effectiveness or clinical efficacy of different preventive methods on caries incidence and increment among low-income children. Using the RE-AIM framework, Project 1 will identify the most effective setting (medical, social service agency or dental) to disseminate FV to the greatest number of 1-3-year-old children. Stratifying on setting, a parallel groups practical RCT will be conducted in 24 community-based primary care clinics (CPCCs) from the UCSF primary care collaborative research network, and 24 California Special Supplemental Nutrition Programs for Women, Infants and Children (WICs). Each non-dental site (CPCC or WIC) will be randomized to a program of parental counseling and onsite FV application or to parental counseling and referral to a dentist for child's FV application. We will also compare two automated telephone counseling methods and utilize teledentistry approaches for blinded caries assessments. Project 2 is an intervention study to be conducted in dental and non-dental settings, both affiliated with Federally Qualified Health Centers near the US-Mexico border, to compare the relative caries prevention efficacy of four protocols in 3-6 year-old children: 1) parental oral-health counseling (C) alone; 2) C+ FV; 3) C+ fluoride-releasing, glass ionomer (Gl) sealants applied to primary molars, and 4) C+FV+ Gl. Our Administrative Core, Statistics and Data Coordinating Center, and Community Liaison Program will support our two RCTs and developmental projects. These endeavors, with other education and career development activities, will foster new investigators to increase oral-health-disparity research capacity.

"Developing a Computerized-Adaptive Test of Parental Health Knowledge    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tooth decay is the most common chronic childhood disease and a recent report from the National Center for Health Statistics indicates that the problem is worsening among preschool children. Furthermore, the burden of this condition falls disproportionately upon children from minority and low socioeconomic status groups. Good dietary and oral hygiene practices and use of appropriate dental services and treatments for both the parent and their child are essential to good oral health. To reduce the prevalence of tooth decay and other oral health conditions among preschoolers, it is critical that more parents become knowledgeable about the causes and consequences of major child oral health diseases and actions they can take to prevent them. Anticipatory guidance from pediatric providers remains an important source of information for parents. However, time constraints during clinical encounters and the unique information needs different parents have indicate that new strategies are needed to enhance the efficiency and the patient-centeredness of the anticipatory guidance process. Specifically, if short, precise measures are available to assess parents' knowledge across relevant content areas before an upcoming visit, parent-specific knowledge profiles can be generated to help clinicians tailor their guidance to parents' specific needs. Computerized adaptive testing (CAT), a measurement approach based on item response theory (IRT) in which items selected for presentation is adapted to the subject's ability level, could provide the basis for these short, accurate assessments. This project will develop a prototype for this knowledge assessment CAT system. Given the impact of tooth decay and worsening trend among young children, we will focus on developing an oral health module in this project. Other modules (e.g., in injury prevention and child development) will be developed in future projects. The proposed project will: 1) develop knowledge questions on child oral health; 2) evaluate questions for inclusion based on readability, understandability, clinical relevance and psychometric performance; and 3) develop an experimental CAT prototype and pilot test CAT score validity. Dental, pediatric and measurement experts will develop knowledge questions based on evidenced-based sources. Readability is assessed by evaluating reading level. Cognitive interviews with a socio-demographically diverse group of parents (N=48) will assess understandability. Clinical experts (dental and pediatric) will review items for clinical relevance, clarity and evidence base. Factor and IRT analyses will be used to examine psychometric performance. Preliminary validity of CAT scores will be assessed through simulation studies and known group tests (across parental health literacy and education groups). Data for analyses will be drawn from self-administered surveys of 350 primary caregivers of children recruited from two Washington D.C. pediatric primary care practices serving diverse racial/ethnic and socio-economic populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The high prevalence and worsening trend in dental caries and disparities in overall oral health observed for preschoolers highlight the importance of oral health as a major public health problem in children. Evidence of deficits and disparities in parental oral health knowledge indicate that educating parents about the causes, consequences and the preventive actions they can take could be an important first step to addressing this problem. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a series of adaptive parental knowledge assessment tests that can support providers in individualizing anticipatory guidance to the needs of parents and their children, which we hope will improve quality of care and outcomes for children.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Relevance: The high prevalence and worsening trend in dental caries and disparities in overall oral health observed for preschoolers highlight the importance of oral health as a major public health problem in children.

"Using Dental Health Videos During Medical Well Child Care Visits to Change Caregi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early childhood caries (ECC) is defined as dental caries in the teeth of children 0-6 years of age. Although largely preventable, dental caries remains the single most common chronic condition in childhood and large disparities exist. Poor children have more than twice the rate of dental caries as non-poor children. A child's ECC risk pivots directly on how their teeth are taken care of by their caregivers. These oral health behaviors are influenced by social determinants of health, including individual attitudes and norms of the caregiver as well as those of their normative groups such as their families and social networks. Narrative videos have had success at changing behaviors. Short videos have been successfully used in social marketing campaigns. The provision of basic preventive dental services at WCC visits provides an opportunity to access high risk children who otherwise lack access to these services. Providing a narrative video at WCC visits directed at improving caregiver oral health behaviors has the potential to reduce the burden of ECC disease in this population. We are proposing to test the feasibility of delivering narrative videos at the WCC visits of poor, Hispanic children who have a disproportionate share of ECC. Innovation: The overall goal of the pilot project is to develop and conduct preliminary testing of theory-based narrative videos and a survey that can be used in a future NIDCR U01 clinical trial aimed at improving the oral health behaviors of caregivers of young children and reducing their children's ECC prevalence. The PRECEDE-PROCEED planning model will provide a structure to apply the Theories of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Normative Social Behavior (TNSB) to the development of the narrative video intervention and will involve collaboration between caregivers and researchers in all aspects of the research. Approach: The research collects relevant attitudes and norms related to oral health through qualitative elicitation interviews. We will develop, administer and analyze a survey using theory-based structural modeling to determine the specific attitudes and norms that influence oral health intentions and behaviors. We will develop video narratives on oral health care in collaboration with caregivers using real stories from the interviews and survey results to specifically target the predisposing, reinforcing and enabling factors that are most strongly associated with oral health intentions and behaviors in this population. Lastly, we will test the feasibility of delivering these video narratives at WCC visits and evaluate them using focus groups. Impact: If this research is successful, the video narratives could be readily integrated into a NIDCR UO1 clinical trial to measure their effectiveness at reducing ECC in this high risk population. Ultimately, we envision that these video narratives will be incorporated into a comprehensive oral health promotion program aimed at high-risk families and be delivered at multiple opportunities in the medical home, dental home, WIC programs, parenting skills development programs and could be incorporated into large public health media campaigns.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Early childhood caries remains the single most common chronic condition in childhood, largely impacting poor children, and yet it is preventable. A child's risk for developing caries is dependent on how their teeth are cared for by their parents/caregivers. This proposal pilots a novel, theory-based, practical and sustainable narrative video intervention intended to impact how parents/caregivers care for their children's teeth.              Early childhood caries remains the single most common chronic condition in childhood, largely impacting poor children, and yet it is preventable.

"Addressing Oral Health Disparities in Medicaid-Enrolled Special Needs Children wi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed application for a K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award is being submitted by Donald Chi, a dentist with advanced clinical training in pediatric dentistry and dental public health. Dr. Chi is currently a PhD candidate in Oral Health Services Research at the University of Iowa. This award will allow Dr. Chi to meet his long-term goal of becoming an independently-funded clinician scholar with an interdisciplinary research program that addresses disparities in oral health and access to dental care for children with special health care needs. His immediate career goal is to extend his dissertation research on access to dental care for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition by developing, testing, and refining a new multi-level conceptual model on access. Dr. Chi proposes the following five aims related to his career development: (1) improve conceptual understanding of access to care for low-income children with special needs; (2) learn and apply new discipline- and theory-based research methods; (3) collect pilot data for a future R01 application; (4) improve writing skills and professional networks; and (5) develop mentorship skills. In addition, he will test the central hypothesis of the proposed research plan - that the health care system-, community-, provider-, family-, and child-level determinants of access to dental care are complex, interrelated, and vary in relative importance depending on type of access being examined - through the following three research aims: (1) identify the multi-level determinants of access to dental care for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition using administrative data; (2) evaluate the extent to which behavioral factors are associated with access to dental care for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition using survey data; and (3) assess the relationship between access to dental care and the level of unmet dental need for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition using clinical data. This research will guide future studies on access and help in the development of multi-level interventions that will improve the oral health of Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition. The proposed career development and research activities will take place in highly supportive, research-intensive environments. Peter Milgrom, DDS and Colleen Huebner, PhD, national experts in their respective fields and Directors of the Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities at the University of Washington School of Dentistry, will supervise Dr. Chi's research and career development activities. In addition, Dr. Chi will receive consulting advice from John Neff, MD (co-developer of Clinical Risk Grouping software); Lloyd Mancl, PhD (biostatistician); and Elizabeth Momany, PhD (Iowa Medicaid data expert). Finally, all activities will be overseen by an External Advisory Committee consisting of Jeffrey Murray, MD (Professor of Pediatrics, University of Iowa); Peter Damiano, DDS, MPH (Professor of Preventive and Community Dentistry, University of Iowa); and Diane Martin, PhD (Professor of Health Services, University of Washington). This cross-institutional, interdisciplinary mentorship team will facilitate Dr. Chi's natural progression from current research experiences to the mentored clinical scientist development phase and then to independence.      Public Health Relevance: There is a dearth of research on access to dental care for publicly-insured children with special health care needs. This project seeks to identify and understand the multi-level determinants of access to dental care for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition.

"Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries is a very different disease than it was forty years ago. While caries is declining in general, caries rates in young children (ages 2-5) in the US have been increasing (US GAO, 2008). There is also increasing disparity seen with severe caries occurring disproportionately in the poor and disenfranchised. Notably, individuals living in selected areas of Appalachia have some of the worst oral health indicators in the U.S. The current proposal is a renewal of our ongoing project (R01-DE-014899) to identify factors contributing to the oral health disparity seen in northern Appalachia versus the rest of the nation. The guiding philosophy of our project has been and continues to be that developing strategies to address this disparity requires simultaneous study of multiple risk components (ideally within families) to determine their roles, interactions among them, and their transmissibility patterns. The long-term goal of our program of research is to determine why the Northern Appalachian population is at increased risk of oral disease so that targeted preventive interventions can be designed.  One of the most notable results from the first project period was that the disparity in dental caries is evident at an early age; the prevalence of total caries experience in 2 - 5 year olds from our Northern Appalachian study was 144% of the prevalence of comparable children in NHANES, with this disparity diminishing in later age groups. Importantly, we also identified genes in multiple categories (tooth structure, taste preference, and salivary proteins) that are associated with either increased caries risk or protection, sometimes showing different effects in different age groups and/or dentitions. Finally, our microbiological and genetic studies of S. mutans demonstrated extreme genetic diversity and showed that S. mutans alone is unlikely to be the sole caries risk factor; more likely, dynamic changes in the oral microbial ecology are responsible for elevated disease risk. Based on the cross-sectional results, we hypothesize that the mechanisms that lead to disparities develop within the first two years of life. Implicit in this hypothesis is the need to address these questions longitudinally among children before and during the time of greatest risk from three different perspectives:  psychosocial, genetic, and microbiological.  The aims of this renewal include development of a longitudinal study of dental caries development early in life by recruiting a cohort of pregnant women. We will then utilize both the data collected in the first project period, and new data from the longitudinal cohort to follow up the significant environmental, genetic and microbial results from the first project period.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite years of study and preventive dentistry, dental caries in young children has been markedly increasing. The goal of this study is to continue our program of studying oral health in Appalachia, in particular to investigate factors (behavioral, genetic and microbial) leading to the early development of dental caries.                                PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite years of study and preventive dentistry, dental caries in young children has been markedly increasing.

"Integrating Social, Behavioral & Preventive Sciences to Reduce Children's Caries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our long-term goal is to improve the oral health and reduce disparities of children in Hawai'i. We hypothesize that the reach, and impact, of effective school-based caries prevention programs can be quantitatively increased by leveraging social networks to target behavioral change.  1. Significance: 10 million children (>20%) of U.S. elementary school age children have untreated dental decay. The disparity in health is notable, rising to 72% for American Indians/Native Americans.  Effective school-based preventions are available but underutilized or unavailable. In Hawai'i there are: an abundance of dentists, but few accepting Medicaid; caries rates exceeding national averages; and no school-based caries prevention programs.  2. Innovation:Integrating social network analysis, behavior change and caries prevention has not before been attempted. If successful, a state-wide caries prevention could facilitate exceeding the goals of Healthy People 2020 prior to 2020.  3. Approach: Generate MOP and preliminary data. The specific aims are to:  Create a manual of procedures (MOP) for pilot program, based on the NIDCR model, and modified from the PI's current successful, but independent, programs focusing social network analysis, behavioral change, and caries prevention.  Carry out pilot program to generate and analyze preliminary data, working with two after school organizations. We will determine the social network and behavioral intent of all site coordinators (~100), and both parents and children in 4 pilot schools (~400 parents and children). Two sets of school's directors, parents, and children will receive targeted behavior change (experimental); the other two sets will receive no behavior change (control). Children in all four schools will receive comprehensive caries prevention. The primary outcome will be program impact, defined by RE-AIM.  Prepare U01 application. We will use outcomes, RE-Aim, Markov Chain/Monte Carlo modeling, economic assessments, and power calculations to generate predictive models. These will allow us to revise the MOP and prepare a U01 application for implementation across the Hawai'ian Islands.  4. Investigators: Four experts in unique content areas will collaborate in this team science program, coordinating expertise in social network analysis, behavioral intent and change, caries prevention, and statistical and economic analysis.  5. Environment: Hawai'i is a small state with substantial health care needs and no school-based caries prevention program. The proposed program therefore coalesces an environment with high need, and investigators from institutions with extraordinary depth.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To improve the oral health and reduce disparities of children in Hawaii, we will implement an effective school-based caries prevention program that leverages social networks to effect social change.              To improve the oral health and reduce disparities of children in Hawaii, we will implement an effective school-based caries prevention program that leverages social networks to effect social change.            ","Integrating Social, Behavioral & Preventive Sciences to Reduce Children's Caries",8211258,R34DE022272,"['Aerobic ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' elementary school ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Island ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Smoking Prevention ', ' Hawaii ', ' behavior change ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Prevention program ', ' base ', ' Institution ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Health behavior ', ' primary outcome ', ' Time ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Risk ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Low income ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' social ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Family ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Schools ', ' Participant ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Work ', ' Site ', ' Goals ', ' Social Network ', ' Dental ', ' programs ', ' Prevention ', ' Data ', ' Methods ', ' Preventive ', ' Institutes ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Training ', ' Infection ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome ', ' Area ', ' improved ', ' Universities ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Health ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Procedures ', ' Modeling ', ' Parents ', ' Manuals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Acute ', ' Science ', ' Caring ', ' Environment ', ' evidence base ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Nodal ', ' California ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Economics ', ' Economic Models ', ' Dentists ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Markov Process ', ' Markov Chains ', ' after-school program ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Change ', ' Weight Change ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Native Americans ', ' Dentistry ', ' Abscess ', ' Medicaid ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Caries prevention ', ' ']",NIDCR,FORSYTH INSTITUTE,R34,2011,332055,0.16574379346646056
"SAPNA Oral Health Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application describes the SAPNA Oral Health Project, a primary care based intervention designed to improve oral health and prevent dental caries in young children from the Bangladeshi immigrant community, a fast-growing immigrant group from South Asia that has received little attention from researchers. The project will be implemented in a new primary care research network, SAPPHIRE (South Asian Practice Partnership for Health Improvement and Research). Dental caries is a problem affecting the majority of poor and ethnic minority children in the United States. South Asian immigrant children are at particularly high risk for dental caries with rates nearly double that of native populations. A variety of structural factors, including social and economic deprivation, linguistic isolation, and difficulty accessing oral health care, and common South Asian infant feeding practices contribute to this problem. Specific aims involve the development, implementation and evaluation of a comprehensive oral health pilot intervention, based on Empowerment Theory, directed at Bangladeshi mothers of children aged 6-18 months. All participants (n=75) will receive enhanced usual care in the form of brief educational messages and oral health referrals by the primary care physician. For intervention participants, South Asian Community Health Navigators (CHNs) will provide two sessions of maternal and familial counseling support using an empowerment model that emphasizes the family's strengths, knowledge, and priorities, followed by patient navigation support in making and keeping an oral health visit, and three follow up phone calls to provide support during the twelve month study period. Development and evaluation of this intervention will involve participatory data collection among primary care providers, clinic staff, project team members, field staff, and patients in order to insure the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. If the project is successful, investigators will apply for funds to conduct a formal test of SAPNA.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: South Asians are a rapidly growing group in the United States, but remain understudied. South Asian children experience extremely high rates of childhood caries, due to child feeding practices and oral hygiene, as well as lack of access to oral health care. Culturally appropriate behavioral interventions for South Asians that address childhood caries risk are a vital public health priority. The project described in this application has potential to serve as a model for primary care-community collaborative interventions that can be used in similar culturally and linguistically isolated groups.              South Asians are a rapidly growing group in the United States, but remain understudied.

"Changing Oral Health Norms and Hygiene Practices among Vulnerable Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reducing persistent oral health disparities among vulnerable low income older adults and adults with disabilities is a central objective in Healthy People 2020 and is a priority of state health departments and area agencies on aging. Limited knowledge of oral health and prevention and treatment alternatives, cultural differences in language and perception of oral health problems, and structural barriers combine to increase oral health disparities in vulnerable populations. This proposal, entitled ""Changing Oral Health Norms and Hygiene Practices among Vulnerable Older Adults"" aims to address these issues by developing and pilot testing a bi-level (building and individual) cognitive/behavioral intervention (Pro-GOH: Pro-Good Oral Health) to reduce significant and persistent disparities in oral health among vulnerable older low income, minority and disabled adults residing in publicly funded senior housing in Central Connecticut. The proposed intervention model is based on Fishbein's modified theory of reasoned action called Integrated Model (IM) of Behavioral Prediction operationalized through Adapted Motivational Interviewing and Practice-to-Mastery (AMI-PM). A substantial percentage of community-residing low income, disabled and minority adults aged 62 and over live in low income senior housing. They are known to be among those most vulnerable to depression, chronic diseases, inadequate primary care, and oral and other health disparities. A successful pilot intervention will provide the basis for a larger efficacy trial based on the RE-AIM approach in other buildings housing vulnerable older adults and adults with disabilities in the Central Connecticut area. The aims of the proposed pilot study are to: 1) Conduct formative research, 2) Conduct a pilot of the intervention at the individual and building level in a typical low income senior residence, 3) Evaluate the pilot individual-level and building-level intervention processes for feasibility, acceptability and fidelity, 4) Conduct an individual level outcome evaluation comparing participants in the treatment building with a matched control building, using a pre and two post intervention assessments, and 5) Prepare Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), evaluation measures and intervention manuals for use in a broad clinical trial in Connecticut.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study's primary significance lies in the potential of this experimental intervention to address significant disparities in oral health and consequent morbidity or reduced quality of life among vulnerable, low- income and primarily minority older adults and those with disabilities through prevention in the locations where they reside. The intervention could provide a model for programs to reduce oral health disparities across Connecticut and nationally.                 The proposed study's primary significance lies in the potential of this experimental intervention to address significant disparities in oral health and consequent morbidity or reduced quality of life among vulnerable, low- income and primarily minority older adults and those with disabilities through prevention in the locations where they reside.

"Family intervention with caregivers of children with urgent dental needs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tooth decay in 2 to 11 year olds is increasing nationally especially among poor and minority populations, and it is unlikely that Healthy People 2020 goals will be met. Dental screening of children in public elementary schools has been mandated in 12 states and endorsed by U.S. and international organizations. Nevertheless, in spite of enthusiasm for the concept, screening and referral has been ineffective as a tool to get parents and caregivers to take children to the dentist. This application is to support planning of a Phase II randomized clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of a referral approach to increase dental attendance (for receipt of care) among inner-city urban elementary school children with urgent/restorative needs. The intervention to be tested relies on two theoretical frameworks -Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM), and the theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) that could be used in conjunction with child-level interventions in a school-based program. The objectives of the R34 study will occur in two phases: (1) pilot phase to validate the modified illness perception questionnaire -Revised (IPQ-RD) for dental caries, acceptability and delivery of the intervention, mediators and moderators for accessing care; focus groups of community organizations and providers to identify enabling resources to be included in the experimental intervention; and testing the experimental intervention regarding appropriateness/accuracy of educational materials; (2) planning phase primarily devoted to the major planning activities required for a U01 submission including development of the study protocol, manual of operations, and Institutional Review Board application and its associated materials. The sample size for the R34 includes 120 caregivers of KG, first, and second grade school children recruited from among 5 elementary schools in an urban inner-city school district in Cleveland, OH, and 10 to 20 key informants from several community agencies or providers. Data collection involves semi-structured one-to-one interviews and questionnaire responses for caregivers and focus groups for community/provider informants. Data analysis will utilize a mixed method design (grounded theory and theory driven) for qualitative data, and descriptive/analytical statistics for quantitative data. This behavioral approach has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for screening programs by utilizing a cost-effective, easily transportable, and sustainable referral approach. The transdiscipilinary research team includes faculty from Department of Community Dentistry at Case Western Reserve and the Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities at the University of Washington.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study addresses an innovative behavioral approach to the referral process never attempted before to address three caregiver issues - (1) importance of caries-free baby teeth for protection of permanent teeth (2) viewing dental caries as a chronic disease rather than acute or episodic; and (3) navigation of resources for dental care access. This behavioral approach also has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for school screening programs required by law in many states.           The proposed study addresses an innovative behavioral approach to the referral process never attempted before to address three caregiver issues - (1) importance of caries-free baby teeth for protection of permanent teeth (2) viewing dental caries as a chronic disease rather than acute or episodic; and (3) navigation of resources for dental care access.

"Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health will focus on oral health concerns of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) and will be known as the Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR). The Principal Investigator is Judith E. N. Albino, PhD, President Emeritus of the University of Colorado and Professor, American Indian/Alaska Native Programs (AIANP) and Craniofacial Biology, and a health psychologist. She will lead the Research Program Administrative Center (RPAC). Dr. Spero Manson, PhD, Professor and Head, AIANP, and a medical anthropologist, will serve as Co-Investigator and lead the Community Liaison and Dissemination Core within RPAC. Biostatistician William Henderson, PhD, Professor, Colorado Health Outcomes Program, will lead the Statistics and Data Coordinating Center (S&DCC). CNOHR takes a comprehensive approach to oral health disparities in the long term, with an initial focus on oral infections and key roles of behavioral factors and comorbidities. The interdisciplinary team includes scientists trained in anthropology, biostatistics, dentistry, economics, medicine, psychology, and public health, supported by experienced project management and technology teams. The three initial projects focus on caries and periodontal disease, and intervene by extending current services and their use as well as adding prevention services and oral health promotion. The first Research Component (RC1) tests an intervention with pregnant women/mothers of newborns on a Northern Plains Reservation, which is focused on the use of motivational interviewing in prevention of ECC. RC2 is a randomized clinical trial of two methods for treating periodontal disease in Southwestern American Indians who also have Type 2 diabetes mellitus. RC3 is a test of a service delivery intervention in which tribal/community members are trained to apply fluoride varnish and deliver personalized oral health education for 3-5 year old children and their parents enrolled in reservation-based Indian Head Start programs. A Developmental Research Program will offer opportunities to pilot work suggested by new investigators, by community participation and planning activities, and by preliminary results of major projects. A focus on dissemination will include activities aimed at increasing community awareness and influencing health policy. Considerable prior experience with the participating tribes and communities has shaped the CNOHR methods and approaches, and ongoing community participation in planning will continue to influence the implementation of the RCs. A robust program of training and career development experiences will include mentoring and support for students at the secondary, undergraduate, professional and graduate, and post-doctoral levels, with emphasis on recruiting AI/AN investigators to oral health disparities research.     ",Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR),8070360,U54DE019259,[''],NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,U54,2011,4201919,0.273548267273214
"Multi-Center Assessment of Health Literacy and Oral Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Healthcare is becoming more complicated and demanding each year. Futuristic technologies, genetic engineering, highly specific drugs, complex insurance plans, and confusing and often conflicting messages from the media all add to the problem. Knowing how to access, understand, and use information about healthcare (i.e., health literacy) is becoming more of a challenge for everyone. According to the Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health in America, profound and consequential oral health disparities exist in the United States today. Epidemiological assessments reveal that low-income and minority populations have the highest incidence and prevalence of oral diseases and disorders. Given that these groups are also most likely to have limited health literacy skills means that they are especially vulnerable to the complications of the healthcare system and most in need of assistance. In order for effective interventions to be developed and implemented, however, a clearer understanding of the associations between limited health literacy and oral health need to be gained. At the heart of that understanding is knowing the ways that different health literacy skills (e.g., reading comprehension, numeracy, conceptual knowledge) work individually and as a group to support oral healthcare decision making and, ultimately, oral health outcomes. These findings would improve oral health and general well-being, and reduce disparities for millions in the nation. The proposed research project brings an experienced multidisciplinary team together from Baltimore, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Washington, DC to comprehensively study these associations between health literacy and oral health. A cross-section of dental patients presenting to three dental clinics in Maryland and California will be recruited and a series of assessments will be administered during face-to-face encounters. These data will also be linked to clinical records so that retrospective and prospective use of dental care services, including expenditures and utilization, may be concurrently assessed. The specific aims of the project include: 1) determining the structural relations between health literacy, oral healthcare decision making, and oral health status; 2) determining the extent to which four different measures of health literacy represent unique skills; and 3) determining the extent to which four different measures of health literacy are associated with oral health, independent of selected sociodemographic and healthcare-related covariates. The proposed project is significant because it represents the first to comprehensively study the associations between health literacy and oral health. It is also significant because it will serve as a guide for comprehensive assessments of health literacy and other health outcomes, outside of dentistry. The project is innovative because it combines multiple measures of health literacy, healthcare decision-making, and oral health outcomes into a single investigation. It is also innovative because it incorporates powerful and contemporary statistical analyses that will reveal the relative contribution of each variable to the overall model, while controlling for the aforementioned covariates.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful completion of the proposed project will result in a comprehensive understanding of the extent to which health literacy is associated with oral health. Gaining this understanding will lead to interventions aimed at improving oral health and reducing oral health disparities, benefitting millions of low-income and minority Americans. In addition, the proposed project will serve as a model for comprehensive studies of the links between health literacy and other health outcomes, beyond dentistry. This more global approach will greatly expand the field of health literacy and increase the likelihood of successful interventions in medicine.           Successful completion of the proposed project will result in a comprehensive understanding of the extent to which health literacy is associated with oral health.

"Health literacy and oral health status of African refugees    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Refugees often arrive in the United States (U.S.) with unmet health needs and significant barriers to care related to linguistic and cultural access. In particular, oral health problems have been identified as the most common health problem of newly arrived refugee children and second most common among refugee adults. Oral health disparities seen among U.S. populations are therefore also likely to be common among refugees and similar immigrant populations entering the U.S. From 1995 - 2005, 21,868 total refugees entered Massachusetts from an increasingly diverse array of countries, particularly in Africa. Most recent refugees from Africa in Massachusetts arrive with rudimentary English literacy skills. While low health literacy contributes significantly to poor oral health status in the U.S., its relationship with oral health status among refugees is unclear. In previous research, we have found that on arrival in the U.S., African refugees have less tooth decay than other refugees while still having high rates of other oral health problems such as gingivitis. Very little is known about how refugees' English literacy levels affect oral health status over time in the U.S. Lastly, it is unclear to what extent refugees' oral health problems improve, persist, or worsen once in the U.S. These findings and issues suggest the need to evaluate the impact of health literacy on oral health outcomes among refugees and immigrants. Therefore, the investigators propose to use mixed quantitative and qualitative methods in a cross-sectional study of newly arrived Somali refugees to determine the relationship between basic English language literacy and oral health status. They hypothesize that increased English literacy may lead to better oral health status independently of the adoption of Western cultural and social factors affecting oral health status, i.e. acculturation. The study will evaluate the impact of English functional health literacy on oral screening examination findings, experience with dental care, and perceptions and knowledge of other key factors that are known to impact on oral health status. Qualitative assessments will focus on experiences with resettlement, oral health, and literacy/education as well as the role of life stressors in determining oral health practices. Findings subsequently may be used to help design culturally acceptable preventive services and public health interventions directed at refugees and immigrants in the U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: No previous study has investigated the relationships between literacy, acculturation, and oral health clinical outcomes among refugees. This study represents an important opportunity to define these relationships and identify areas in which preventive oral health interventions may be directed. Preventive oral health interventions directed toward the growing immigrant and refugee populations in the U.S. will be important for reducing oral health disparities and their associated personal and societal costs for these communities and the larger U.S. population.          ",Health literacy and oral health status of African refugees,8033096,R01DE017716,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Gingivitis ', ' Documentation ', ' Somalia ', ' Dental ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' English Language ', ' health literacy ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Immigrant ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communications Media ', ' Forms of Communication ', ' Hygiene ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Africa ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' Refugees ', ' Information Services ', ' base ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Individual ', ' Research ', ' Affect ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Clinical ', ' improved ', ' Perception ', ' Improve Access ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' African ', ' stressor ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Writing ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' skills ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Country ', ' high risk ', ' Performance at work ', ' work performance ', ' job performance ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Oral ', ' cost ', ' Caring ', ' Services ', ' member ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Link ', ' functional health literacy ', ' Health ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' literacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Time ', ' Communities ', ' social ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Pattern ', ' Schools ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Medical ', ' experience ', ' instrument ', ' Life ', ' Preventive ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Adoption ', ' Behavior ', ' Area ', ' Population ', ' ']",NIDCR,MASSACHUSETTS STATE DEPT OF PUB HEALTH,R01,2011,493616,0.2535505001294066
"Neighborhood Characteristics and Adolescence Dental Visits: A Multilevel Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed project builds upon cross-sectional studies that have investigated the relationship of dental visits to person level factors, such as age, gender, and marital status among adults in the United States. However, person level factors alone are insufficient to explain differences in dental visits, especially when seeking solutions to address racial and ethnic disparities in dental visits. Neighborhood characteristics like poverty, racial/ethnic composition, and educational attainment, available from census information, have not been investigated as potential predictors or correlates of dental visits. The overall goal of this project is to acquire preliminary data in order to submit an RO1 grant proposal to fully investigate the relationship of neighborhood intervention strategies over time on adolescents' dental service utilization. Therefore, the long-term goal of our research is to extend the science on dental visits by including neighborhood characteristics. The short-term goal of this project is to examine the influence of neighborhood characteristics on dental visits over time among adolescents progressing to young adulthood. The periods of adolescence and early adulthood represent stages in life for developing oral habits conducive for promoting positive oral health lifestyles and behavior over the full life span. This project is national in scope and could be significant to the development of appropriate programs and oral health policies that will include community grounded strategies. It will be executed using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) - a dataset specifically designed to collect information on adolescents progressing to young adulthood. This project will investigate three specific aims: 1) to examine the temporal profile of dental visits among adolescents progressing to young adulthood; 2) to investigate in the same sample the extent to which neighborhood characteristics explain racial/ethnic differences seen in dental visits after adjustment for person level factors; 3) to assess the association of person level factors and neighborhood characteristics on dental visits among adolescents progressing to adulthood. Add Health data proposed for use in this study was collected in four waves: Wave I (1994- 95), Wave II (1996), Wave III (2001-2002), Wave IV (2007-2008), and contains both questionnaire responses and contextual information. Add Health is the only comprehensive database that will allow for a wide range of analyses beyond cross-sectional analysis of contemporaneous associations of contextual characteristics with respondent outcomes, and allow for longitudinal and dynamic analyses of contextual influences. Multilevel hierarchical modeling will be used to estimate the influence of neighborhood characteristics on dental visits. Findings from this project will improve our knowledge and understanding of dental visits during the critical period from adolescence to young adulthood.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying the different neighborhood characteristics associated with dental service utilization to improve program planning and policy development.

"Leveraging Opportunities to Improve Oral Health in Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Oral health is a matter of public health concern because it affects a large proportion of the population and is linked with general health status. Early intervention strategies to address oral health problems can prevent illness, diagnose serious conditions early, and maintain optimum overall health. The landmark publication, Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon General, highlighted a lack of awareness of the importance of oral health among the general public, and found a significant disparity between racial and socioeconomic groups with regard to oral health and ensuing overall health issues. Developing interventions to improve oral health for older adults is a particular challenge, given the complex set of causal pathways and delays over the life course that are involved. System dynamics (SD) is an approach and a set of conceptual tools that enables understanding of the structure and dynamics of complex systems. SD simulation models help policymakers assess the impact of different interventions to find those that may yield the greatest leverage in the short term and in the longer term. We hypothesize that: (1) oral health in older adults is due to the lifelong accumulation of advantageous and disadvantageous experiences at multiple scales, from the micro-scale of the mouth to the societal scale that involves US federal policy, including lack of routine dental care coverage under Medicare; and (2) factors at the neighborhood scale (e.g., community access), interpersonal scale (e.g., oral health promotion), and individual scale (e.g., nutrition and chronic illness) may be particularly important in influencing dental health outcomes such as tooth retention, dental caries, and periodontal disease. It is critical to consider the complex relationships across all scales as is possible using SD conceptual tools to develop and implement interventions for older adults that cannot be gained by studying component parts in isolation. To address these hypotheses and leverage opportunities to improve dental health in older adults in Harlem and Washington Heights/Inwood, New York City, our specific aims are to: Aim 1: Build an SD model of factors affecting tooth retention in older adults using a group modeling process. (A) Refine our causal map through input from practitioners and policy scholars in oral health and aging. (B) Calibrate our SD model based upon the local population and local conditions in northern Manhattan. Aim 2: Evaluate the performance of our SD model to project the potential impacts of proposed interventions. (A) Produce a status quo simulation that assumes continuation of existing programs at current levels. (B) Examine the effects of alternative interventions involving, e.g., treatment and oral hygiene activity, on the prevalence and burden of tooth loss and other oral diseases using simulations from our SD model. (C) Compare the predictive performance of our SD model with regression models of dental health. Successful completion of these aims will aid in identifying interventions that are more effective and cost-saving than others, to provide policymakers with an indication of where scarce resources ought to be focused to improve oral health in older adults at the local level and at broader levels.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Developing interventions to improve dental health for older adults is a challenge, given the complex set of causal pathways and delays that are involved.

"Predicting Caries Risk in Underserved Toddlers in Primary Healthcare Settings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dental caries, the most common chronic disease of childhood, is a largely preventable disease. This proposal focuses on addressing inequities in dental caries experience among preschool aged U.S. children. It has been inspired by the shift and increase in dental caries among subsets of the population (i.e., 2-5 year old children, especially from underserved/minority population groups) that calls for a greater focus on targeted healthcare. In an environment of increasing healthcare costs and resource constraints, this approach is paramount in addressing oral health disparities. Because children have multiple well-child pediatric visits in the early years of life, many lower socioeconomic status (SES) and minority children have much greater access to medical care than to dental care. Our long-term goal is to reduce disparities in dental caries experience in young children in the U.S. by developing effective risk-based caries preventive and therapeutic strategies to be delivered through new models for oral health care, including primary medical healthcare settings. However, the problem is that currently there is no practical, validated and easily-scored tool practitioners can use to accurately and reliably assess, and effectively triage children at the highest risk for caries. Such an urgently needed tool will be developed in this proposed research. Thus, the objective of this study is to validate a caries risk questionnaire in order to develop a practical and easily-scored caries risk tool for use in primary medical healthcare settings to identify young, diverse U.S. children (1-4 years of age) with the highest risk for the development of caries. This will be accomplished by having the parents of 1,326 infants complete a caries risk questionnaire and by performing caries examinations on the children at baseline (child's age 12 + 3 months old), and again at 18 months (child's age 30 + 3 months) and 36 months after the baseline (child's age 48 + 3 months) to monitor the caries disease process, and how well the risk tool predicts caries risk status as the child ages. A great strength of this proposal is that it involves four experienced investigator groups who offer strong partnerships between medical and dental teams, and three study sites with well established primary care medical research networks that provide access and facilitate follow up to a variety of at-risk, diverse populations, including ethnic and racial minorities and low SES groups. Each study site also has an NIH Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA), and will benefit from infrastructure and experience in longitudinal clinical translational research. The significance of this work is that identification of high caries risk children in primary healthcare settings allows cost-effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed, targeted and used in these settings to prevent early childhood caries. This will have immediate broad impact and influence on existing dental and medical policies and programs regarding screening and prevention of dental caries among young children from diverse disadvantaged and underserved subgroups, in primary medical and dental pediatric healthcare settings.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The relevance of this collaborative, innovative and high impact project between physicians and dentists is that it will result in a valid, reliable, and practical (easy to score) caries risk assessment tool for the identification of high caries risk infants/toddlers in primary medical healthcare settings allowing for cost effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed and targeted to prevent early childhood caries, and help reduce disparities in caries experience.                The relevance of this collaborative, innovative and high impact project between physicians and dentists is that it will result in a valid, reliable, and practical (easy to score) caries risk assessment tool for the identification of high caries risk infants/toddlers in primary medical healthcare settings allowing for cost effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed and targeted to prevent early childhood caries, and help reduce disparities in caries experience.             ",Predicting Caries Risk in Underserved Toddlers in Primary Healthcare Settings,8181970,U01DE021412,"['Population Group ', ' Toddler ', ' Iowa ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' preschool ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Letters ', ' Indiana ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' North Carolina ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental ', ' primary care setting ', ' Patients ', ' experience ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Medical ', ' Risk ', ' response ', ' American ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Environment ', ' programs ', ' Data ', ' Life ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Work ', ' Age ', ' Physicians ', ' Population ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Visit ', ' Address ', ' Testing ', ' Research ', ' tool ', ' Award ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Staging ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Caring ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Clinical ', ' Therapeutic ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Discipline ', ' Services ', ' Site ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Goals ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Screening procedure ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Medical Research ', ' Minority ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Infant ', ' Monitor ', ' Modeling ', ' base ', ' Process ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Dyes ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' prospective ', ' Prevalence ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Policies ', ' Subgroup ', ' Parents ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Preventive ', ' aged ', ' Lesion ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' early childhood ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Universities ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' high risk ', ' Pediatric Research ', ' Dentists ', ' Wit ', ' practice-based research network ', ' Expert Opinion ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Pedodontics ', ' Pediatric Dentistry ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' 4 year old ', ' Triage ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 year old ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' pediatrician ', ' Academy ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Caries prevention ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2011,2644459,0.1816516892480538
"Northwest/Alaska/Hawaii Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Northwest/Alaska/Hawaii Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities at the University of Washington in Seattle focuses on tooth decay in children, because it is the major oral health challenge U.S. society faces. Tooth decay in preschool children is worsening. The Healthy People 2010 Midcourse Review found the country moving away from national targets for young children: 22% of children 2-4 years of age have tooth decay while the target is 11%. The research plan addresses disparities and inequities in access to dental care and to healthy teeth (tooth decay or caries prevention) for low-income and vulnerable mothers and children within a conceptual framework that specifies the ecological nature of disparity problems. The specific aims of the community-based multidisciplinary research plan are to: 1) Conduct human trials to evaluate the efficacy of interventions to prevent and treat dental caries in children and their caretakers; 2) Develop community-based research that translates existing knowledge and new information into technologies and interventions that will reduce disparities; and 3) Encourage and support developmental research that has the potential to lead to independent studies to address and reduce caries inequity in children. The Center includes the Research Program Administrative Center (RPAC), two major community based intervention trials focused on dental caries- Community-Based Intergenerational Oral Health Promotion In Rural America and Parent-Child Toothbrushing with 1000 ppm Fluoride Toothpaste to Prevent ECC-and a Statistics and Data Coordinating Center (S&DCC). Primary research program sites include 12 rural county health departments in the State of Oregon serving whites and Latinos, a training center in Klamath County Oregon, and large Community Health Centers serving minority communities in Woodburn, Oregon (Salud Medical Center, Latinos) and Waianae Coast, Hawaii (Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders). Further dissemination sites are in the Alaska bush, rural Hawaii and Washington State. Developmental research projects involve communities in rural Eastern and Southwestern Washington State and focus on school nutrition and the use of topical PVP-iodine and fluoride varnish in caries prevention. The Center also includes a training core to increase the cadre of oral health disparities researchers through clinical research training and mentoring for junior scientists, efforts to enhance the awareness of health disparities research in the predoctoral curriculum in dentistry and medicine, and increases the numbers of minority and rural students entering dentistry and health sciences disciplines.

"Rural Older Adults: Oral Health, Diet & Quality of Life    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rural older adults constitute an oral health disparate population. The disparities in oral health conditions experienced by older rural adults impact dietary quality and nutritional status, as well as social integration. We propose to continue a productive program of research that has focused on nutritional self-management among older rural adults in a multi-ethnic population (African American, American Indian, and white). In the grant cycle now concluding, we have demonstrated that these older adults suffer from high rates of oral health deficits. Associated with these deficits we find that (1) older adults actively manage their food intake through behaviors such as avoiding and modifying selected foods, practices that affect dietary quality; and (2) they have reduced social integration associated with oral health disparities, which reduces their quality of life. The cross-sectional nature of the research conducted to date limits our understanding of how the observed patterns of self-management develop and the causal linkages among oral health deficits, self-management behaviors, and outcomes such as dietary quality and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). The proposed renewal of this grant will extend our previous work by (1) using a mixed methods approach to develop a detailed assessment tool for documenting oral health-related nutritional self-management behaviors, and (2) constructing a cohort of surviving members ages 65-79 of the original population-based sample and supplementing it to achieve a total sample of 750 for conducting repeated measures study of oral health- related nutritional self-management. This larger sample will be assessed twice, with a two year interval. The goal of the research proposed for the next funding period is to better understand how changes in oral health status affect dietary quality, as mediated by oral health-related nutritional self-management. To do this, we will accomplish three specific aims: (1) describe changes in oral health status and OHRQoL over time in older rural adults, comparing the changes by racial/ethnic group and by utilization of dental care, (2) specify the role of self-management strategies in mediating the relationship of oral health to dietary quality and to OHRQoL, and (3) construct components for a future intervention that will identify and assist older adults at nutritional risk due to oral health deficits in improving their dietary quality. Accomplishment of these aims will extend conceptual work on health self-management to oral health and specify the pathways by which oral health deficits impact dietary quality and nutritional status, providing points for future intervention to reduce health disparities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Older adults in rural communities have significant oral health problems, compared to younger people and those in urban and suburban communities. This research will identify pathways by which oral health deficits in these older adults lead to reduced dietary quality. It will study how these older adults deal with oral health problems, particularly ways that they adapt their food preparation and meal patterns to maintain their preferred ways of eating. This research will produce components to be tested in future interventions to reduce oral health disparities.           Older adults in rural communities have significant oral health problems, compared to younger people and those in urban and suburban communities.

"Longitudinal Study of Dental Caries in VLBW Infants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This longitudinal study addresses the relationship between birth weight and early childhood caries (ECC) in a cohort of pre-term very low birth weight (VLBW) and full-term normal birth weight (NBW) infants. VLBW and ECC disproportionately affects poor and minority children costing Medicaid billions of dollars annually for treatment. The improved survival of VLBW children has resulted in greater long-term disabilities and need for health services, thus classifying them as children with special health care needs. The oral health needs of VLBW children have not been adequately studied. VLBW children are known to have a high prevalence of enamel defects in the primary dentition, which in turn can lead to increased susceptibility to ECC. Socio- behavioral factors that can predispose some children to ECC are unknown in VLBW children. Therefore the primary aims of the study are to (1) assess the incidence of ECC in VLBW and NBW infants; (2) assess mediators such as the incidence of developmental enamel defects, S.mutans infection and the extent of oral health behaviors in VLBW and NEW infants; (3) assess the indirect relationship between birth weight and ECC via mediators after controlling for independent moderating variables. A total of 200 VLBW and 200 NBW infants will be followed at 8 and 18-20 months corrected age. The proposed study will collect data on caries (decayed and filled surfaces), mediating biological variables (enamel hypoplasia and opacity, S.mutans levels) and infant oral health behavior (feeding, diet, oral hygiene practices, and dental access), and independent variables (demographics, parent predisposing, enabling, need characteristics, dental behavior, biological and child medical factors). Data analysis for testing aims 1 and 2 includes the generalized estimating equations (GEE) models, and a two-stage structural equations model (SEM) for testing the role of mediators in aim 3. The sample size provide 85 to 99% power to compare the two groups in terms of the three study aims. The results of this study will provide critical data to address the knowledge gaps in taking care of VLBW children. The clinical implications include primary prevention, early diagnosis and treatment to prevent further susceptibility to dental decay. It is also of public health interest since interventions to target knowledge, attitude, beliefs, and oral health practices can be implemented in programs for special needs children, and there by improve both oral and systemic health.           ",Longitudinal Study of Dental Caries in VLBW Infants,8072568,R01DE017947,"['Washington ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Sample Size ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' early childhood ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Attitude ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Belief ', ' Diet ', ' Oral ', ' cohort ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Staging ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Dental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Minority ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' demographics ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Medicine ', ' Literature ', ' Family ', ' Health Services Needs ', ' Caring ', ' Reporting ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Defect ', ' Parents ', ' Behavioral ', ' Surface ', ' cost ', ' Medical ', ' disability ', ' Live Birth ', ' Infection ', ' Knowledge ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Incidence ', ' Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Collaborations ', ' Address ', ' Area ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' early intervention ', ' Testing ', ' Modeling ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Universities ', ' improved ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' interest ', ' Mediating ', ' programs ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' response ', ' Characteristics ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Age ', ' Infant ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Attention ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Data ', ' Biological ', ' Clinical ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' feeding ', ' Behavior ', ' Accounting ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' United States ', ' Affect ', ' Primary Dentition ', ' Deciduous Dentition ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Insurance ', ' dental health insurance ', ' Periodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontia insurance ', ' Oral Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Surgery Insurance ', ' mental development ', ' Dental Schools ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Medicaid ', ' Dental General Practice ', ' dental practice ', ' Older Population ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Dental Enamel ', ' tooth enamel ', ' Enamel ', ' Dental Enamel Hypoplasia ', ' Hypoplastic Enamel ', ' Enamel Hypoplasia ', ' Enamel Agenesis ', ' Streptococcus mutans ', ' S.mutans ', ' S. mutans ', ' Very Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' very low birth weight infant human ', ' very low birth weight ', ' VLBW (human) ', ' Survivors ', ' Alaska ', ' Health behavior ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Perinatal Care ', ' Equation ', ' ']",NIDCR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,465795,0.19483193891418546
"Diffusion of Anticipatory Guidance to Prevent ECC Disease Transmission: Secondary    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry officially recommend that children--especially minority and underserved populations at high risk for tooth decay-have their first visit to the dentist at 12 months or within 6 months after the eruption of the their first tooth. While the recommendation is meritorious, in focusing solely on the child it fails to acknowledge the critical role of the mother. If the mother receives care, the child benefits both from a biological perspective (preventing or postponing infection of the child) and because anticipatory guidance is important for establishing attitudes and beliefs regarding the importance of baby teeth and the need for year one visit. Not more than one or two percent of children now receive a year one visit. This research proposes to conduct secondary analyses of a dataset from the Oregon Care Provider Study in order to: 1. Determine the diffusion of anticipatory guidance to pregnant women on ECC  transmission among general dentists; 2. Compare the personal and practice characteristics of dentists who usually provide  anticipatory guidance on ECC to pregnant women in their practices and those who do  not; 3. Determine whether local dentist supply and sociodemographic characteristics are  associated with dentist provision of anticipatory guidance on ECC to pregnant women. The dataset was constructed from the results of a 2006-2007 survey under a grant from the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, HRSA, and carried out in collaboration with the Social and Economic Sciences Research Center at Washington State University. The mail survey of all 1,604 general dentists in Oregon was done with a primary purpose to study dentists' attitudes, beliefs and practices regarding dental care for pregnant women. The research will be conducted within the Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities. The Center is a multidisciplinary research unit at the University of Washington addressing the maternal and child oral health and health disparities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The investigators propose a secondary analysis of dentist survey data from the State of Oregon regarding dental care for pregnant women and their offspring in order to better understand diffusion of primary prevention and anticipatory guidance for Early Childhood Caries.              The investigators propose a secondary analysis of dentist survey data from the State of Oregon regarding dental care for pregnant women and their offspring in order to better understand diffusion of primary prevention and anticipatory guidance for Early Childhood Caries.            ",Diffusion of Anticipatory Guidance to Prevent ECC Disease Transmission: Secondary,8029192,R03DE021439,"['Pregnant Women ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' disease transmission ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Care ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Mails ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Academy ', ' Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' HRSA ', ' United States Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' Prenatal care ', ' Dentists ', ' Maternal and Child Health ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Pediatrics ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Diffusion ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Time ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Collaborations ', ' Mothers ', ' Infection ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Data ', ' clinical practice ', ' Minority ', ' Adoption ', ' Biological ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' American ', ' United States ', ' Grant ', ' Washington ', ' social ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Prevention ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Research ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Behavioral ', ' Process ', ' Visit ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Knowledge ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Recommendation ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' success ', ' Science ', ' Staging ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Universities ', ' high risk ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Family ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Economics ', ' Characteristics ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' Belief ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Pedodontics ', ' Pediatric Dentistry ', ' early childhood ', ' offspring ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Attitude ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Oregon ', ' Dental ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R03,2011,156000,0.09523051572862212
"Changing Oral Health Norms and Hygiene Practices among Vulnerable Older Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reducing persistent oral health disparities among vulnerable low income older adults and adults with disabilities is a central objective in Healthy People 2020 and is a priority of state health departments and area agencies on aging. Limited knowledge of oral health and prevention and treatment alternatives, cultural differences in language and perception of oral health problems, and structural barriers combine to increase oral health disparities in vulnerable populations. This proposal, entitled ""Changing Oral Health Norms and Hygiene Practices among Vulnerable Older Adults"" aims to address these issues by developing and pilot testing a bi-level (building and individual) cognitive/behavioral intervention (Pro-GOH: Pro-Good Oral Health) to reduce significant and persistent disparities in oral health among vulnerable older low income, minority and disabled adults residing in publicly funded senior housing in Central Connecticut. The proposed intervention model is based on Fishbein's modified theory of reasoned action called Integrated Model (IM) of Behavioral Prediction operationalized through Adapted Motivational Interviewing and Practice-to-Mastery (AMI-PM). A substantial percentage of community-residing low income, disabled and minority adults aged 62 and over live in low income senior housing. They are known to be among those most vulnerable to depression, chronic diseases, inadequate primary care, and oral and other health disparities. A successful pilot intervention will provide the basis for a larger efficacy trial based on the RE-AIM approach in other buildings housing vulnerable older adults and adults with disabilities in the Central Connecticut area. The aims of the proposed pilot study are to: 1) Conduct formative research, 2) Conduct a pilot of the intervention at the individual and building level in a typical low income senior residence, 3) Evaluate the pilot individual-level and building-level intervention processes for feasibility, acceptability and fidelity, 4) Conduct an individual level outcome evaluation comparing participants in the treatment building with a matched control building, using a pre and two post intervention assessments, and 5) Prepare Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), evaluation measures and intervention manuals for use in a broad clinical trial in Connecticut.        The proposed study's primary significance lies in the potential of this experimental intervention to address significant disparities in oral health and consequent morbidity or reduced quality of life among vulnerable, low- income and primarily minority older adults and those with disabilities through prevention in the locations where they reside. The intervention could provide a model for programs to reduce oral health disparities across Connecticut and nationally.

"Increasing Oral Cancer Screening by Dentists:Qualitative Research on Practitioner Age-adjusted (world) oral cancer (OC) incidence and mortality rates for Puerto Rico (PR) are among the highest in the Western Hemisphere. Early diagnosis of oral cancer will decrease the morbidity and mortality resultant from this disease and its treatment. The objective of Healthy People 2010 is to increase the percentage of oral and pharyngeal cancers (stage I, localized) detected at the earliest stage to 50%. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico appears to have a deficit in early cancer detection that is strikingly worse than the mainland U.S. We have reported an ¿inverse triangle¿ of invasive carcinomas to in situ carcinomas and premalignant oral cancer lesions, i.e., significantly more pathology sign-out diagnoses for oral cancer than the other lesion types. Thus, routinely including oral cancer examinations in clinical practice will detect both more pre-malignant and earlier oral cancers with the result of decreasing the morbidity and mortality in Puerto Rico. The long-term goal of this project is to strengthen secondary prevention of oral cancer by increasing the practice of head and neck examinations in dental practices in terms of the a) proportion of persons screened, b) the frequency of screenings (initial, recall exams), and c) the quality of the screenings. The Specific Aims are: 1) identify methods to change OC screening practice behaviors by dentists in Puerto Rico, 2) identify emerging technologies that will increase practitioner screening in Puerto Rico, 3) identify emerging social trends and activities that will increase practitioner screening in Puerto Rico , and 4) based on the findings from Specific Aims #1-3, define a pragmatic implementation strategy for increasing practitioner screening for oral cancer in Puerto Rico. To accomplish the Specific Aims, qualitative investigative methods (i.e., expert focus groups and key informant interviews) will be conducted to obtain the necessary data from Specific Aims #1-3 to allow accomplishing Specific Aim #4. Thus, culturally/professionally acceptable methods, technologies and activities can be developed that are recognized by the targeted group (dentists) as being acceptable as well as productive in increasing the frequency of oral cancer screenings. These objectives will be accomplished by an experienced multi-disciplinary research team. Significance: By focusing public health and professional activities on highly acceptable oral cancer screening dissemination and implementation operations that are based on the findings of this project, oral cancer morbidity and mortality will be decreased in Puerto Rico. An objective of Healthy People 2010 is to increase the percentage of oral and pharyngeal cancers (stage I,  localized) detected at the earliest stage to 50%. Puerto Rico�s deficit in early detection compared to the U.S.  makes it a sensitive site to measuring intervention effectiveness to increase early detection and decrease the  health disparity of PR, which has the highest oral cancer rates in the Western hemisphere.

"Addressing Oral Health Disparities in Medicaid-Enrolled Special Needs Children wi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed application for a K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award is being submitted by Donald Chi, a dentist with advanced clinical training in pediatric dentistry and dental public health. Dr. Chi is currently a PhD candidate in Oral Health Services Research at the University of Iowa. This award will allow Dr. Chi to meet his long-term goal of becoming an independently-funded clinician scholar with an interdisciplinary research program that addresses disparities in oral health and access to dental care for children with special health care needs. His immediate career goal is to extend his dissertation research on access to dental care for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition by developing, testing, and refining a new multi-level conceptual model on access. Dr. Chi proposes the following five aims related to his career development: (1) improve conceptual understanding of access to care for low-income children with special needs; (2) learn and apply new discipline- and theory-based research methods; (3) collect pilot data for a future R01 application; (4) improve writing skills and professional networks; and (5) develop mentorship skills. In addition, he will test the central hypothesis of the proposed research plan - that the health care system-, community-, provider-, family-, and child-level determinants of access to dental care are complex, interrelated, and vary in relative importance depending on type of access being examined - through the following three research aims: (1) identify the multi-level determinants of access to dental care for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition using administrative data; (2) evaluate the extent to which behavioral factors are associated with access to dental care for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition using survey data; and (3) assess the relationship between access to dental care and the level of unmet dental need for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition using clinical data. This research will guide future studies on access and help in the development of multi-level interventions that will improve the oral health of Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition. The proposed career development and research activities will take place in highly supportive, research-intensive environments. Peter Milgrom, DDS and Colleen Huebner, PhD, national experts in their respective fields and Directors of the Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities at the University of Washington School of Dentistry, will supervise Dr. Chi's research and career development activities. In addition, Dr. Chi will receive consulting advice from John Neff, MD (co-developer of Clinical Risk Grouping software); Lloyd Mancl, PhD (biostatistician); and Elizabeth Momany, PhD (Iowa Medicaid data expert). Finally, all activities will be overseen by an External Advisory Committee consisting of Jeffrey Murray, MD (Professor of Pediatrics, University of Iowa); Peter Damiano, DDS, MPH (Professor of Preventive and Community Dentistry, University of Iowa); and Diane Martin, PhD (Professor of Health Services, University of Washington). This cross-institutional, interdisciplinary mentorship team will facilitate Dr. Chi's natural progression from current research experiences to the mentored clinical scientist development phase and then to independence.      Public Health Relevance: There is a dearth of research on access to dental care for publicly-insured children with special health care needs. This project seeks to identify and understand the multi-level determinants of access to dental care for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition. Our work will be used to develop clinical and policy strategies designed to reduce oral health disparities and to improve the oral health of these vulnerable children.

"Hollywood Smiles    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The African American (AA) Gullah population has a higher rate of oral health (OH) disparities when compared to AAs nationally. OH disparities among this group can be attributed to several factors including fear, lack of trust in providers, past negative experiences, access to care and cultural beliefs. The proposed study will test the feasibility of a bundled, multi-level intervention, whose design is based on the preferences of the targeted rural Gullah population. If this study demonstrates feasibility we will broaden our recruitment for future R01 with other Gullah communities statewide. Our long-term partnership goal is to have a community clinic in Hollywood with MUSC dental students and faculty. This is a sustainable model where the students would be more engaged and exposed to treating the rural community and the community would have increased access and acceptable and relevant OH care. The aims of this project are to: 1. Develop a novel, community preferred OH multi-level intervention (Hollywood Smiles-HS) in church settings; 2. Evaluate the HS intervention feasibility including intervention dosage and fidelity as well as monitoring and measurement of target outcomes and cost; 3. Evaluate preliminary efficacy indications of the HS and estimate outcome measurement variability needed to calculate sample size for a subsequent study of intervention efficacy. A social-ecological model is proposed to guide the intervention, providing a framework for intervening at multiple levels of influence (individual, peer and organizational) on OH behaviors. Cluster randomization will be used to assign 2 churches to an intervention (HS) group (n=30) and a control group (CG) (n=30), thru a coin- toss procedure, for a total of 60 participants. All participants will receive primary standard of care dental therapy at a community dental clinic and transportation passes for each of the dental visits. Participants, members of the church in the HS group will also receive a 3-month multi-level intervention that will include 1:1 contact with a community OH promoter (COHP), peer educational sessions, and church level interventions. As specified by the aims and guided by the conceptual framework, the outcome measures will include: a) dependent variables of oral health; b) intervention mediator variables (oral health behavior report, oral health literacy, oral health self-efficacy and dental anxiety level); and, d) independent variables (demographic and physiologic measures) and church climate. A systematic process evaluation will be conducted and measures of feasibility will include recruitment, adherence (dosage/fidelity), dropout proportions, acceptability, Church Advisory Board satisfaction, and reach of the intervention.        The public health relevance of this application relates to the use of a non-dental community oral health promoter to improve oral health literacy and access to dental care in their community. The goal of this study is to educate and provide needed direction and assistance in accessing oral health care. Developing an intervention that promotes oral health literacy is necessary to help reduce disparities in this population.

"State Policies and Children's Oral Health Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral health is critically important to children's overall health and represents the largest unmet health need for children. With the Surgeon General's 2000 report on oral health, there has been a growing awareness of the need to increase access to services and address racial/ethnic disparities in both service use and oral health status. Despite states' considerable efforts to address oral health and a few recent reports attempting to review selected state policies, little is known about the degree to which state policies affect children's oral health. The goal of the proposed study is to assess whether variations in state policies are related to children's oral health conditions and care utilization for children ages 1-17 years. The specific aims include: 1) To examine variations in state oral health policies in 2006. 2) To examine whether state oral health policies in 2006 are associated with state-level children's oral health and dental care utilization in 2007. 3)To examine whether state oral health policies in 2006 have an independent effect on children's oral health in 2007 after adjusting for individual child, family and state characteristics.  Data for the proposed study come from: the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH), the 2007 American Community Survey (ACS) conducted by the US Census, and from 2006 policy data compiled by the American Dental Association (ADA), the Children's Dental Health Project (CDHP), and the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors (ASTDD) in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). T-tests will be used to assess variations in the number and extent of state policies across states (Aim 1). Multivariable regression models will be constructed to consider relations between state policies with state- level oral health status and care use, conditioned on state characteristics (Aim 2). Multilevel regression models will be used to assess whether state policies have an independent effect on children's oral health after adjusting for individual child, family, and state characteristics. Age-specific policies will be examined for age subgroups (1-5, 6-11, and 12-17 years) (Aim 3).  The proposed work will be the first study to link state policies to service use and children's oral health status, which supports NIDCR's Strategic Goal 1 (objective I-2: to increase the Institute's commitment to basic and applied research in the behavioral and social sciences) and Goal IV (objective IV-1: to identify the full range of factors that contribute to oral health inequality). Findings will inform prevention programs and policies that address children's oral health status and the emerging Healthy People 2020 oral health objectives. Our findings will also suggest whether selected provisions under Health Care Reform should be prioritized.

"Using Dental Health Videos During Medical Well Child Care Visits to Change Caregi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early childhood caries (ECC) is defined as dental caries in the teeth of children 0-6 years of age. Although largely preventable, dental caries remains the single most common chronic condition in childhood and large disparities exist. Poor children have more than twice the rate of dental caries as non-poor children. A child's ECC risk pivots directly on how their teeth are taken care of by their caregivers. These oral health behaviors are influenced by social determinants of health, including individual attitudes and norms of the caregiver as well as those of their normative groups such as their families and social networks. Narrative videos have had success at changing behaviors. Short videos have been successfully used in social marketing campaigns. The provision of basic preventive dental services at WCC visits provides an opportunity to access high risk children who otherwise lack access to these services. Providing a narrative video at WCC visits directed at improving caregiver oral health behaviors has the potential to reduce the burden of ECC disease in this population. We are proposing to test the feasibility of delivering narrative videos at the WCC visits of poor, Hispanic children who have a disproportionate share of ECC. Innovation: The overall goal of the pilot project is to develop and conduct preliminary testing of theory-based narrative videos and a survey that can be used in a future NIDCR U01 clinical trial aimed at improving the oral health behaviors of caregivers of young children and reducing their children's ECC prevalence. The PRECEDE-PROCEED planning model will provide a structure to apply the Theories of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Normative Social Behavior (TNSB) to the development of the narrative video intervention and will involve collaboration between caregivers and researchers in all aspects of the research. Approach: The research collects relevant attitudes and norms related to oral health through qualitative elicitation interviews. We will develop, administer and analyze a survey using theory-based structural modeling to determine the specific attitudes and norms that influence oral health intentions and behaviors. We will develop video narratives on oral health care in collaboration with caregivers using real stories from the interviews and survey results to specifically target the predisposing, reinforcing and enabling factors that are most strongly associated with oral health intentions and behaviors in this population. Lastly, we will test the feasibility of delivering these video narratives at WCC visits and evaluate them using focus groups. Impact: If this research is successful, the video narratives could be readily integrated into a NIDCR UO1 clinical trial to measure their effectiveness at reducing ECC in this high risk population. Ultimately, we envision that these video narratives will be incorporated into a comprehensive oral health promotion program aimed at high-risk families and be delivered at multiple opportunities in the medical home, dental home, WIC programs, parenting skills development programs and could be incorporated into large public health media campaigns.        Early childhood caries remains the single most common chronic condition in childhood, largely impacting poor children, and yet it is preventable. A child's risk for developing caries is dependent on how their teeth are cared for by their parents/caregivers. This proposal pilots a novel, theory-based, practical and sustainable narrative video intervention intended to impact how parents/caregivers care for their children's teeth.

"Trends and Trajectories of Oral Health Among Older Americans:  The Role of Cognit    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral health is a critical but often overlooked component of health and well-being in older Americans. Compared to younger individuals, elderly people have an increased incidence and prevalence of oral diseases. Little is known about the patterns of oral health changes in late life at either the population or the individual level. In addition, few studies have examined factors, such as cognitive function, that may be associated with oral health changes. This study has the following specific aims: (1) examine and project racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in oral health trends among older Americans; (2) examine the intra- and inter-individual differences of change in oral health among older adults; (3) cross-sectionally analyze the relationship between cognitive function and oral health; and (4) assess the linkage between cognitive function and oral health among older adults by conducting longitudinal data analysis. This proposed research is innovative in several respects: 1) state-of-the-art analytic approach to analyses on population trends and projections, and individual trajectories of oral health; 2) examination of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in oral health trends and trajectories; 3) focus on individuals with a range of cognitive function (from individuals with potential dementia to cognitively normal); 4) examination of the linkage between cognitive function and oral health while controlling for other important covariates; and 5) use of multiple well-established datasets, including nationally and regionally representative samples, that are longitudinal or cross-sectional in nature, to compare and confirm the patterns and predictors of oral health across the various datasets. We expect our study to lead to a better understanding of the mechanism underlying oral health deterioration and its risk factors. And, in turn, our study may suggest strategies for effective and innovative practices to prevent oral health deterioration. As secondary data will be used, the proposed study is a very cost-effective way to accomplish our objectives. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevant to Public Health The growing number and proportion of the older adults in the U.S. makes geriatric oral health an increasingly important public health issue that this study will address.

"Longitudinal Study of Dental Caries in VLBW Infants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This longitudinal study addresses the relationship between birth weight and early childhood caries (ECC) in a cohort of pre-term very low birth weight (VLBW) and full-term normal birth weight (NBW) infants. VLBW and ECC disproportionately affects poor and minority children costing Medicaid billions of dollars annually for treatment. The improved survival of VLBW children has resulted in greater long-term disabilities and need for health services, thus classifying them as children with special health care needs. The oral health needs of VLBW children have not been adequately studied. VLBW children are known to have a high prevalence of enamel defects in the primary dentition, which in turn can lead to increased susceptibility to ECC. Socio- behavioral factors that can predispose some children to ECC are unknown in VLBW children. Therefore the primary aims of the study are to (1) assess the incidence of ECC in VLBW and NBW infants; (2) assess mediators such as the incidence of developmental enamel defects, S.mutans infection and the extent of oral health behaviors in VLBW and NEW infants; (3) assess the indirect relationship between birth weight and ECC via mediators after controlling for independent moderating variables. A total of 200 VLBW and 200 NBW infants will be followed at 8 and 18-20 months corrected age. The proposed study will collect data on caries (decayed and filled surfaces), mediating biological variables (enamel hypoplasia and opacity, S.mutans levels) and infant oral health behavior (feeding, diet, oral hygiene practices, and dental access), and independent variables (demographics, parent predisposing, enabling, need characteristics, dental behavior, biological and child medical factors). Data analysis for testing aims 1 and 2 includes the generalized estimating equations (GEE) models, and a two-stage structural equations model (SEM) for testing the role of mediators in aim 3. The sample size provide 85 to 99% power to compare the two groups in terms of the three study aims. The results of this study will provide critical data to address the knowledge gaps in taking care of VLBW children. The clinical implications include primary prevention, early diagnosis and treatment to prevent further susceptibility to dental decay. It is also of public health interest since interventions to target knowledge, attitude, beliefs, and oral health practices can be implemented in programs for special needs children, and there by improve both oral and systemic health.

"Exploring Cultural Variations in Oral Health Messages for Mexican-Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities among minority groups in the United States are pervasive. Although it is widely accepted that health communication directed toward these groups should be ""culturally appropriate"" or ""culturally sensitive,"" little empirical work has been directed toward examining what aspects of cultural sensitivity are effective. This study aims to advance the theoretical understanding of which aspects of cultural sensitivity influence the perception and understanding of health messages. This understanding will improve the effectiveness of health communication targeting minorities. Even though the current study focuses on oral health in the Mexican-American community, with further study to generalize the findings, this work has the potential to impact the effectiveness of any sort of health communication (e.g., diet, diabetes prevention, or breast cancer screening) targeting a variety of health contexts and ethnic/cultural groups. Mexican-Americans are the largest and fastest growing segment of a fast growing Hispanic population. Mexican-Americans have the lowest levels of dentist visits (Wall & Brown, 2004) and their children are more likely to have untreated caries (Healthy People, 2010) and to have never visited a dentist than any other group (Scott & Simile, 2005). Written oral health messages containing information about caries formation and prevention in children will be developed in conjunction with consultants from two National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research funded centers addressing oral health disparities. The messages will target Spanish speaking mothers of young children. Researchers have theorized two dimensions of cultural sensitivity: surface structure (e.g., images and graphics) and deep structure (e.g., cultural values and beliefs) (Resnicow, Braithwaite, Ahluwalia, & Baranowski, 1999). Using recent work on Mexican-American beliefs about oral health and caries etiology (e.g., Hoeft, Barker & Masterson, 2010), the cultural appropriateness (high vs. low) of surface and deep structure will be manipulated to give four different messages in a 2x2 experimental design allowing the investigation of the effectiveness of each type of cultural appropriateness and the interaction. Participants will be 300 Spanish speaking Mexican-American mothers who will be randomly assigned to one of the four conditions. Half of the participants will get a pretest to assess their initial knowledge and beliefs. All participants will receive a posttest assessing knowledge, beliefs, intentions, and perceptions of the message. In addition, 20 participants from each condition will be randomly chosen to have an in-depth interview to better understand the effects of the messages. Learning which messages are effective, and why, will improve oral health communication to Mexican-American mothers. With further research, the theoretical and practical gains made in the proposed research could be generalized to impact other types of oral health communication for Mexican-Americans and further to many types of health communication for ethnic/cultural minorities. Ultimately, understanding cultural sensitivity will help in the tailoring of health messages delivered on the internet.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will improve the effectiveness of written oral health messages targeting Spanish speaking Mexican-American mothers by exploring different aspects of cultural sensitivity. Results may impact the oral health of Mexican-American children as well as, with more research, generalize to a wide range of health messages targeting a variety of minorities.           This research will improve the effectiveness of written oral health messages targeting Spanish speaking Mexican-American mothers by exploring different aspects of cultural sensitivity.

"Proof of Concept: Scardovia wiggsiae is Cariogenic in vivo    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While it has been demonstrated that Bifidobacteriaceae species are strongly associated with dental caries, there is limited information about cariogenicity of these species. The long-term goal of this research project is to reduce and ultimately help prevent early childhood caries (ECC). The objective of this R21 application is to prove/disprove the concept that Scardovia wiggsiae, which was detected as significantly associated with severe-ECC, is cariogenic in vivo. The central hypothesis is that S. wiggsiae will induce tooth demineralization and produce caries in vivo, acting either acting alone or in synergy with Streptococcus mutans. The rationale for this proposal is that proof of cariogenic potential in vivo would justify in- depth studies of the bacterium's relevance to human dental health, and if so, its cariogenic mechanisms. The central hypothesis and accomplishment of the objective of this application will be tested with the following two specific aims. Aim 1: Cariogenicity of Scardovia wiggsiae in vivo. The working hypothesis is that Scardovia wiggsiae will colonize and induce tooth demineralization in an animal model system. Differing concentrations of the organism will be used to inoculate Sprague Dawley rats fed a cariogenic diet. Animals will be tested for colonization and tissue invasion by S. wiggsiae, and scored for caries. Aim 2: Cariogenicity of Scardovia wiggsiae with S. mutans in vivo. Significant associations between children colonized by both S. wiggsiae and S. mutans and severe-ECC were detected. The working hypothesis is that a combination of S. wiggsiae and S. mutans will colonize and induce more tooth demineralization than either species alone. In Aim 2, the ability for separate infections by S. wiggsiae and S. mutans to induce caries will be compared with a combined S. wiggsiae and S. mutans infection in the same animal model used in Aim 1. Test species colonization and tissue invasion, and dental caries will be assayed. The expected outcomes in Aim 1 will be the demonstration of cariogenicity of a newly named species significantly associated with severe-ECC, and in Aim 2 demonstration of enhanced cariogenicity by the combined infection of S. wiggsiae with S. mutans. The expected confirmation that S. wiggsiae is cario- genic in vivo would have an important positive impact on the field because it would indicate the need for further investigation into the association of the species with diverse populations at risk for caries and determining mechanism(s) of cariogenicity on which to base future improved microbial diagnosis, risk assessment and treatment for early childhood caries. The research proposed is significant because it is expected to enable subsequent definitive studies at the R01 level based on the hypothesis that S. wiggsiae is a caries pathogen in humans. While this proposal stems from species association with severe-ECC, the findings will have direct application for studies of caries in adults including rapidly progressing coronal and root lesions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will prove or disprove the concept that Scardovia wiggsiae is cariogenic. If this species proves to be cariogenic, it would be of public health relevance to test it as a risk indicator for dental caries which would particularly benefit populations with oral health disparities that experience rampant/severe-ECC. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that is described in the priorities of the strategic plan of NIDCR (2009-2013) by integrating a molecular and clinical (in vivo disease model) approach to prove or disprove a diagnostic biomarker for caries risk (Objective I-1), and examining factors that could contribute to oral health inequality (Objective IV-1).

"Reimbursing Medical Providers for Early Childhood Caries Preventive Services    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early childhood caries (ECC) is a significant national problem that disproportionately affects low- income children, and its prevalence is increasing. Because it is difficult to reach pre-school aged children for caries prevention, thirty-three state Medicaid programs have implemented reimbursement to medical primary care providers (PCPs) to provide early childhood caries preventive services (ECCPS). However, states report slow rates of uptake. Further, little is known about the child, provider, and community factors associated with the receipt of ECCPS and the effect on subsequent dental service use. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of PCP reimbursement on access to preventive oral health services in early childhood for Medicaid-enrolled children. Our central hypothesis is that these policies have improved access to ECCPS with variations in policy effectiveness based on child and community characteristics. To test our hypothesis, we will use secondary data provided by the Florida and Texas Medicaid programs to accomplish the following specific aims: (1) to compare receipt of ECCPS before and after PCP reimbursement and examine whether there are variations among particularly vulnerable subgroups of children, including children with special health care needs and racial/ethnic minorities; (2) to examine the impact of PCP reimbursement on access to ECCPS in high-risk communities, and (3) to evaluate whether receipt of ECCPS from a medical PCP is associated with an increased likelihood of seeing a dental provider. Secondary data sources include child-level longitudinal enrollment databases linked to claims and encounter data for children 0-3 years old enrolled in Florida and Texas Medicaid. Multivariable regression analyses and geographic information systems techniques will be used to evaluate policy impacts and variations by child and community characteristics. The proposed research will provide important information about how effective current policies are in achieving their objectives and whether there are variations in policy effectiveness among Medicaid subpopulations. This information is a critical first step in developing actionable strategies to improve the performance of ECC prevention programs and reversing the trend of increasing ECC prevalence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study promotes NIDCR Strategic Goal 4: Apply Rigorous, Multidisciplinary Research Approaches to Eliminate Disparities in Oral, Dental and Craniofacial Health and the Healthy People 2020 (proposed) goals to increase the proportion of low-income children and adolescents who receive preventive dental services (OH HP2020-4) and to reduce the proportion of children and adolescents who have dental caries in their primary or permanent teeth (OH HP2020-6). Specifically, this study examines the effect of medical provider reimbursement on access to early childhood caries preventive services and subsequent dental use among Medicaid enrollees. The findings from this study will inform the development of targeted interventions to improve the effectiveness of early childhood caries prevention programs and reverse the trend of increasing caries prevalence among pre-school aged children.

"Neighborhood Characteristics and Adolescence Dental Visits: A Multilevel Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed project builds upon cross-sectional studies that have investigated the relationship of dental visits to person level factors, such as age, gender, and marital status among adults in the United States. However, person level factors alone are insufficient to explain differences in dental visits, especially when seeking solutions to address racial and ethnic disparities in dental visits. Neighborhood characteristics like poverty, racial/ethnic composition, and educational attainment, available from census information, have not been investigated as potential predictors or correlates of dental visits. The overall goal of this project is to acquire preliminary data in order to submit an RO1 grant proposal to fully investigate the relationship of neighborhood intervention strategies over time on adolescents' dental service utilization. Therefore, the long-term goal of our research is to extend the science on dental visits by including neighborhood characteristics. The short-term goal of this project is to examine the influence of neighborhood characteristics on dental visits over time among adolescents progressing to young adulthood. The periods of adolescence and early adulthood represent stages in life for developing oral habits conducive for promoting positive oral health lifestyles and behavior over the full life span. This project is national in scope and could be significant to the development of appropriate programs and oral health policies that will include community grounded strategies. It will be executed using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) - a dataset specifically designed to collect information on adolescents progressing to young adulthood. This project will investigate three specific aims: 1) to examine the temporal profile of dental visits among adolescents progressing to young adulthood; 2) to investigate in the same sample the extent to which neighborhood characteristics explain racial/ethnic differences seen in dental visits after adjustment for person level factors; 3) to assess the association of person level factors and neighborhood characteristics on dental visits among adolescents progressing to adulthood. Add Health data proposed for use in this study was collected in four waves: Wave I (1994- 95), Wave II (1996), Wave III (2001-2002), Wave IV (2007-2008), and contains both questionnaire responses and contextual information. Add Health is the only comprehensive database that will allow for a wide range of analyses beyond cross-sectional analysis of contemporaneous associations of contextual characteristics with respondent outcomes, and allow for longitudinal and dynamic analyses of contextual influences. Multilevel hierarchical modeling will be used to estimate the influence of neighborhood characteristics on dental visits. Findings from this project will improve our knowledge and understanding of dental visits during the critical period from adolescence to young adulthood.

"Southeast Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A multi-disciplinary Center built on strong community partnerships is proposed at the University of Florida to foster research, dissemination of findings, and training on disparities in oral health. The initial theme of this Center is to reduce disparities in cancer survival by promoting early detection of oral and pharyngeal cancer (OPC) through two community-based theoretically-derived intervention projects. Community-based interventions built on strong theory are rare in oral health disparity research. A major strength of this application is the inclusion of an evidence base to support our research methodology. The first project will refine and upgrade health care providers' ability to detect early stages of OPC using evidence-based health education theory and the second will apply theoretically derived health promotion models to increase the likelihood that African American men obtain regular OPC screening exams. An R21-level project to validate a cellular biomarker related to susceptibility to squamous cell carcinoma is also proposed. The second theme of this Center is to apply community-based research principles gleaned from aforementioned work to follow-up projects that will address communities' oral health needs. One such R21-level developmental project will determine feasibility of conducting large scale preventive and treatment intervention in a well defined population of low-income minority children with aggressive periodontitis. It is expected that both R21-level projects will lead to full community-based interventions. This Center will facilitate oral health disparity research by 1) providing new resources through which multi-disciplinary teams jointly conduct targeted community-based intervention research; 2) strengthening the partnerships among researchers, clinicians, and the community; and 3) developing a pipeline of oral health disparity researchers and leaders. Our longstanding partnerships enable us to disseminate the results of our research such that we influence the dental/medical community, community members/patients, and policymakers alike. As proposed, the Center will produce a synergistic force resulting in a measurable reduction of disparities in oral health among the underserved. Community partners include the Alachua County Organization for Rural Needs (ACORN, a clinic to serve low-income rural and minority patients), Florida state dental organizations, Department of Health, faith-based community organizations (ACTION network and 4A's), and Florida A&M University, a historically Black College/University. The research conducted by the Southeast Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health (CRRDOH) will generate an evidence base that will affect public policy and will result in long term benefits for disadvantaged citizens.    ",Southeast Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health,8266911,U54DE019261,"['Affect ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Squamous Cell Epithelioma ', ' Squamous Carcinoma ', ' Planocellular Carcinoma ', ' Epidermoid Carcinoma ', ' Squamous cell carcinoma ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Florida ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Low Income Population ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Patients ', ' Chronic Periodontitis ', ' Periodontitis ', ' Public Policy ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Glean ', ' Pharynx Cancer ', ' Pharyngeal Cancer ', ' Pharnyx Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Pharynx ', ' Malignant Pharyngeal Tumor ', ' Malignant Pharyngeal Neoplasm ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pharynx ', ' base ', ' Medical ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Rural ', ' Fostering ', ' oral cancer early detection ', ' Screening for Oral Cancer ', ' Staging ', ' Clinic ', ' oral pharyngeal ', ' Oropharynxs ', ' Oropharynx ', ' Oropharyngeal ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Measurable ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' dissemination research ', ' Minority ', ' community organizations ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' evidence base ', ' biomarker ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,U54,2012,1815927,0.29085152574150813
"Center for the Biologic Basis of Oral/Systemic Disease (CBBOSD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The link between chronic oral infections and general health has been recognized since the early 20th century. During the last 2 decades, retrospective epidemiological studies and prospective longitudinal, as well as intervention, studies have supported that these chronic oral infections with accompanying chronic inflammation associate with various systemic diseases and their sequelae. This continuation application for the Center for the Biologic Basis of Oral/System Diseases (CBBO/SD) addresses major initiatives of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) regarding improving oral and general health ofthe U.S. population. The CBBO/SD is organized into 3 cInical projects: Project 1: Chronic Inflammation at the Oral and Cervico/Vaginal Mucosa; Project 2: Physiology of the Stress Response in Patients with Temporomandibular Disorders and Fibromyalgia; Project 3: Coordinated Oral-Intestinal Immune Response in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; and 2 translational science projects: Project 4: Ontogeny of Innate Immune Responses at Mucosal Surfaces; and Project 5: Gene Therapy for Orofacial Pain. These projects enlist junior investigators from the Colleges of Dentistry, Nursing, and Medicine, as well as senior mentors/co-investigators from multiple colleges at UK. The thematic interface of the projects focuses on the contribution of chronic inflammation to oral and systemic diseases. They engage populations of expectant women, patients with chronic orofacial pain, and inflammatory bowel disease. These clinical projects interact with the translational projects at the level of a common understanding of innate immune responses and inflammation, and novel therapeutic intervention strategies forthe chronic orofacial pain. The CBBO/SD provides an infrastructure for development of the junior faculty by providing grants management support, educational opportunities, a biostatistics/bioinformatics core, and a clinical research center. The continuation of the CBBO/SD is supported by the success during the initial tenure of the center in transitioning junior investigators towards independent funding, coupled with substantial investment from the university and individual colleges.

"Validating OCT and Raman spectroscopy for assessment of tooth de/remineralization     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries continues to be prevalent in children and youth, with significant oral health disparities existing in some population groups. This disease arises when the balance between pathological factors (e.g. cariogenic bacteria) and protective factors (e.g. saliva flow) is tipped in favour of demineralization. The prevalence of caries suggests that the disease is not being effectively managed with an emphasis traditionally on restorative procedures where caries lesions are already serious. Dentistry is undergoing a paradigm shift away from surgical treatment of caries to a medical model of disease prevention and management. This change aims to address the disease cause with minimally invasive CAries Management By Risk Assessment (CAMBRA) efforts. For this paradigm to be successful, dentists need better tools to detect early lesions. Early detection will allow dentists to monitor and counsel patients in managing caries risk factors to help prevent disease progression. We hypothesize that the combination of morphological and biochemical information provided by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and polarized Raman spectroscopy (PRS), respectively, can provide clinicians with an improved tool to detect and assess early caries lesions as well as to be used for both short- and long-term monitoring for better caries management. The overall objective of this competitive renewal proposal is to develop a novel software and hardware clinical platform based on a combined OCT-PRS intra-oral probe for early dental caries detection and assessment. To achieve this goal we plan to: 1) establish a clinic-friendly software platform to derive caries relevant parameters from the OCT-PRS data, 2) develop combined OCT-PRS caries assessment intra-oral probes for proximal and occlusal surfaces, and finally 3) validate the hardware and software for clinical utility in caries detectio and assessment through two small scale clinical studies. Our research will provide novel automated software algorithms to provide clinicians with measures of caries presence, lesion extent, quantitative assessment of caries lesion activity and mineralization status during the examination of the patient. The proposed developments and evidence-based findings will support a paradigm shift in treating caries as a disease. This research supports the new US Healthy People 2020 program in which an oral health objective is to reduce caries and untreated decay among children and adolescents.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dental decay (dental caries) is preventable and curable, yet it is among the most common chronic diseases affecting children in the USA with significant oral health disparities existing in some population groups.

"Influence of Community Networks on Oral Health/Behaviors among Hispanics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos in the USA often suffer poor oral health. Their dental insurance coverage is the lowest of any minority, and their dental culture is often associated with behaviors that merely react to pain and acute conditions. Studies of oral health among Latinos have hitherto been limited to characterization of a few socio- economic and socio-cultural variables at the individual level. In this R21 application we propose a novel, exploratory study of a well-bounded community network of people of Mexican descent. Our short term objective is to explore the utility of applying network science research methods to improve our understanding of oral health behaviors. Our specific aims are to 1) describe the nature and distribution of social network ties, oral health risk and protective behaviors, and use of dental care within one existing community network of people of Mexican descent in the USA; and 2) examine the extent and nature of social network influence on the oral health risk and protective behavior, and the utilization of dental care of individuals within this community. Such basic structure will allow (in future projects) to contrast and refine the model with data relevant to other regions in the USA or Mexico, other Hispanic groups, other minorities, and/or generate new models. Having clearer knowledge about the factors contributing to better health behaviors will provide a foundation to craft better informed public policy, up-to-date clinical guidelines, culturally sensitive clinical and preventive care, and future research directions. Of particular interest would be to attain a superior understanding of the network structures and ties that may present key entry points to modify the relationships between actors in the community - with emphasis placed among those hubs that would be more influential to effectively disseminate actionable, accurate, and significant health and health care information.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanic dental insurance coverage is the lowest of any minority in the USA, and their dental culture is often associated with behaviors that merely react to pain and acute conditions. There is a need to understand how such behaviors are modulated beyond individual characteristics, by looking into layers of decisions made at the group and community levels. We aim to assemble social networks models to support crafting better informed public policy, up-to-date clinical guidelines, and culturally sensitive clinical and preventive care.              Hispanic dental insurance coverage is the lowest of any minority in the USA, and their dental culture is often associated with behaviors that merely react to pain and acute conditions.

"SAPNA Oral Health Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application describes the SAPNA Oral Health Project, a primary care based intervention designed to improve oral health and prevent dental caries in young children from the Bangladeshi immigrant community, a fast-growing immigrant group from South Asia that has received little attention from researchers. The project will be implemented in a new primary care research network, SAPPHIRE (South Asian Practice Partnership for Health Improvement and Research). Dental caries is a problem affecting the majority of poor and ethnic minority children in the United States. South Asian immigrant children are at particularly high risk for dental caries with rates nearly double that of native populations. A variety of structural factors, including social and economic deprivation, linguistic isolation, and difficulty accessing oral health care, and common South Asian infant feeding practices contribute to this problem. Specific aims involve the development, implementation and evaluation of a comprehensive oral health pilot intervention, based on Empowerment Theory, directed at Bangladeshi mothers of children aged 6-18 months. All participants (n=75) will receive enhanced usual care in the form of brief educational messages and oral health referrals by the primary care physician. For intervention participants, South Asian Community Health Navigators (CHNs) will provide two sessions of maternal and familial counseling support using an empowerment model that emphasizes the family's strengths, knowledge, and priorities, followed by patient navigation support in making and keeping an oral health visit, and three follow up phone calls to provide support during the twelve month study period. Development and evaluation of this intervention will involve participatory data collection among primary care providers, clinic staff, project team members, field staff, and patients in order to insure the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. If the project is successful, investigators will apply for funds to conduct a formal test of SAPNA.           South Asians are a rapidly growing group in the United States, but remain understudied. South Asian children experience extremely high rates of childhood caries, due to child feeding practices and oral hygiene, as well as lack of access to oral health care. Culturally appropriate behavioral interventions for South Asians that address childhood caries risk are a vital public health priority.

"Rural Older Adults: Oral Health, Diet & Quality of Life    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rural older adults constitute an oral health disparate population. The disparities in oral health conditions experienced by older rural adults impact dietary quality and nutritional status, as well as social integration. We propose to continue a productive program of research that has focused on nutritional self-management among older rural adults in a multi-ethnic population (African American, American Indian, and white). In the grant cycle now concluding, we have demonstrated that these older adults suffer from high rates of oral health deficits. Associated with these deficits we find that (1) older adults actively manage their food intake through behaviors such as avoiding and modifying selected foods, practices that affect dietary quality; and (2) they have reduced social integration associated with oral health disparities, which reduces their quality of life. The cross-sectional nature of the research conducted to date limits our understanding of how the observed patterns of self-management develop and the causal linkages among oral health deficits, self-management behaviors, and outcomes such as dietary quality and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). The proposed renewal of this grant will extend our previous work by (1) using a mixed methods approach to develop a detailed assessment tool for documenting oral health-related nutritional self-management behaviors, and (2) constructing a cohort of surviving members ages 65-79 of the original population-based sample and supplementing it to achieve a total sample of 750 for conducting repeated measures study of oral health- related nutritional self-management. This larger sample will be assessed twice, with a two year interval. The goal of the research proposed for the next funding period is to better understand how changes in oral health status affect dietary quality, as mediated by oral health-related nutritional self-management. To do this, we will accomplish three specific aims: (1) describe changes in oral health status and OHRQoL over time in older rural adults, comparing the changes by racial/ethnic group and by utilization of dental care, (2) specify the role of self-management strategies in mediating the relationship of oral health to dietary quality and to OHRQoL, and (3) construct components for a future intervention that will identify and assist older adults at nutritional risk due to oral health deficits in improving their dietary quality. Accomplishment of these aims will extend conceptual work on health self-management to oral health and specify the pathways by which oral health deficits impact dietary quality and nutritional status, providing points for future intervention to reduce health disparities.        Older adults in rural communities have significant oral health problems, compared to younger people and those in urban and suburban communities. This research will identify pathways by which oral health deficits in these older adults lead to reduced dietary quality. It will study how these older adults deal with oral health problems, particularly ways that they adapt their food preparation and meal patterns to maintain their preferred ways of eating. This research will produce components to be tested in future interventions to reduce oral health disparities.

"Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries is a very different disease than it was forty years ago. While caries is declining in general, caries rates in young children (ages 2-5) in the US have been increasing (US GAO, 2008). There is also increasing disparity seen with severe caries occurring disproportionately in the poor and disenfranchised. Notably, individuals living in selected areas of Appalachia have some of the worst oral health indicators in the U.S. The current proposal is a renewal of our ongoing project (R01-DE-014899) to identify factors contributing to the oral health disparity seen in northern Appalachia versus the rest of the nation. The guiding philosophy of our project has been and continues to be that developing strategies to address this disparity requires simultaneous study of multiple risk components (ideally within families) to determine their roles, interactions among them, and their transmissibility patterns. The long-term goal of our program of research is to determine why the Northern Appalachian population is at increased risk of oral disease so that targeted preventive interventions can be designed.  One of the most notable results from the first project period was that the disparity in dental caries is evident at an early age; the prevalence of total caries experience in 2 - 5 year olds from our Northern Appalachian study was 144% of the prevalence of comparable children in NHANES, with this disparity diminishing in later age groups. Importantly, we also identified genes in multiple categories (tooth structure, taste preference, and salivary proteins) that are associated with either increased caries risk or protection, sometimes showing different effects in different age groups and/or dentitions. Finally, our microbiological and genetic studies of S. mutans demonstrated extreme genetic diversity and showed that S. mutans alone is unlikely to be the sole caries risk factor; more likely, dynamic changes in the oral microbial ecology are responsible for elevated disease risk. Based on the cross-sectional results, we hypothesize that the mechanisms that lead to disparities develop within the first two years of life. Implicit in this hypothesis is the need to address these questions longitudinally among children before and during the time of greatest risk from three different perspectives:  psychosocial, genetic, and microbiological.  The aims of this renewal include development of a longitudinal study of dental caries development early in life by recruiting a cohort of pregnant women. We will then utilize both the data collected in the first project period, and new data from the longitudinal cohort to follow up the significant environmental, genetic and microbial results from the first project period.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite years of study and preventive dentistry, dental caries in young children has been markedly increasing.

"Diffusion of Anticipatory Guidance to Prevent ECC Disease Transmission: Secondary    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry officially recommend that children--especially minority and underserved populations at high risk for tooth decay-have their first visit to the dentist at 12 months or within 6 months after the eruption of the their first tooth. While the recommendation is meritorious, in focusing solely on the child it fails to acknowledge the critical role of the mother. If the mother receives care, the child benefits both from a biological perspective (preventing or postponing infection of the child) and because anticipatory guidance is important for establishing attitudes and beliefs regarding the importance of baby teeth and the need for year one visit. Not more than one or two percent of children now receive a year one visit. This research proposes to conduct secondary analyses of a dataset from the Oregon Care Provider Study in order to: 1. Determine the diffusion of anticipatory guidance to pregnant women on ECC  transmission among general dentists; 2. Compare the personal and practice characteristics of dentists who usually provide  anticipatory guidance on ECC to pregnant women in their practices and those who do  not; 3. Determine whether local dentist supply and sociodemographic characteristics are  associated with dentist provision of anticipatory guidance on ECC to pregnant women. The dataset was constructed from the results of a 2006-2007 survey under a grant from the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, HRSA, and carried out in collaboration with the Social and Economic Sciences Research Center at Washington State University. The mail survey of all 1,604 general dentists in Oregon was done with a primary purpose to study dentists' attitudes, beliefs and practices regarding dental care for pregnant women. The research will be conducted within the Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities. The Center is a multidisciplinary research unit at the University of Washington addressing the maternal and child oral health and health disparities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The investigators propose a secondary analysis of dentist survey data from the State of Oregon regarding dental care for pregnant women and their offspring in order to better understand diffusion of primary prevention and anticipatory guidance for Early Childhood Caries.

"Family intervention with caregivers of children with urgent dental needs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tooth decay in 2 to 11 year olds is increasing nationally especially among poor and minority populations, and it is unlikely that Healthy People 2020 goals will be met. Dental screening of children in public elementary schools has been mandated in 12 states and endorsed by U.S. and international organizations. Nevertheless, in spite of enthusiasm for the concept, screening and referral has been ineffective as a tool to get parents and caregivers to take children to the dentist. This application is to support planning of a Phase II randomized clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of a referral approach to increase dental attendance (for receipt of care) among inner-city urban elementary school children with urgent/restorative needs. The intervention to be tested relies on two theoretical frameworks -Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM), and the theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) that could be used in conjunction with child-level interventions in a school-based program. The objectives of the R34 study will occur in two phases: (1) pilot phase to validate the modified illness perception questionnaire -Revised (IPQ-RD) for dental caries, acceptability and delivery of the intervention, mediators and moderators for accessing care; focus groups of community organizations and providers to identify enabling resources to be included in the experimental intervention; and testing the experimental intervention regarding appropriateness/accuracy of educational materials; (2) planning phase primarily devoted to the major planning activities required for a U01 submission including development of the study protocol, manual of operations, and Institutional Review Board application and its associated materials. The sample size for the R34 includes 120 caregivers of KG, first, and second grade school children recruited from among 5 elementary schools in an urban inner-city school district in Cleveland, OH, and 10 to 20 key informants from several community agencies or providers. Data collection involves semi-structured one-to-one interviews and questionnaire responses for caregivers and focus groups for community/provider informants. Data analysis will utilize a mixed method design (grounded theory and theory driven) for qualitative data, and descriptive/analytical statistics for quantitative data. This behavioral approach has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for screening programs by utilizing a cost-effective, easily transportable, and sustainable referral approach. The transdiscipilinary research team includes faculty from Department of Community Dentistry at Case Western Reserve and the Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities at the University of Washington.        The proposed study addresses an innovative behavioral approach to the referral process never attempted before to address three caregiver issues - (1) importance of caries-free baby teeth for protection of permanent teeth (2) viewing dental caries as a chronic disease rather than acute or episodic; and (3) navigation of resources for dental care access. This behavioral approach also has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for school screening programs required by law in many states.

"Northwest/Alaska/Hawaii Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Northwest/Alaska/Hawaii Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities at the University of Washington in Seattle focuses on tooth decay in children, because it is the major oral health challenge U.S. society faces. Tooth decay in preschool children is worsening. The Healthy People 2010 Midcourse Review found the country moving away from national targets for young children: 22% of children 2-4 years of age have tooth decay while the target is 11%. The research plan addresses disparities and inequities in access to dental care and to healthy teeth (tooth decay or caries prevention) for low-income and vulnerable mothers and children within a conceptual framework that specifies the ecological nature of disparity problems. The specific aims of the community-based multidisciplinary research plan are to: 1) Conduct human trials to evaluate the efficacy of interventions to prevent and treat dental caries in children and their caretakers; 2) Develop community-based research that translates existing knowledge and new information into technologies and interventions that will reduce disparities; and 3) Encourage and support developmental research that has the potential to lead to independent studies to address and reduce caries inequity in children. The Center includes the Research Program Administrative Center (RPAC), two major community based intervention trials focused on dental caries- Community-Based Intergenerational Oral Health Promotion In Rural America and Parent-Child Toothbrushing with 1000 ppm Fluoride Toothpaste to Prevent ECC-and a Statistics and Data Coordinating Center (S&DCC). Primary research program sites include 12 rural county health departments in the State of Oregon serving whites and Latinos, a training center in Klamath County Oregon, and large Community Health Centers serving minority communities in Woodburn, Oregon (Salud Medical Center, Latinos) and Waianae Coast, Hawaii (Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders). Further dissemination sites are in the Alaska bush, rural Hawaii and Washington State. Developmental research projects involve communities in rural Eastern and Southwestern Washington State and focus on school nutrition and the use of topical PVP-iodine and fluoride varnish in caries prevention. The Center also includes a training core to increase the cadre of oral health disparities researchers through clinical research training and mentoring for junior scientists, efforts to enhance the awareness of health disparities research in the predoctoral curriculum in dentistry and medicine, and increases the numbers of minority and rural students entering dentistry and health sciences disciplines.

"University of Guam/Cancer Research Center of Hawaii Partnership (1 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Oral cancer is the sixth leading cancer in the world, and ranks in the top three cancers in countries where betel nut (also known as areca nut) chewing is common. In Micronesia, a group of Pacific Islands where betel nut is frequently chewed, the risk of oral cancer is elevated, but quite variable across populations. For the period 1985-1998 (age-adjusted to the 1988 U.S. population), the prevalence per 100,000 ranged from 4.2 in Chuuk to 31.8 in Yap. In Guam, the incidence of mouth cancer per 100,000 population for the period 1997-2003, age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. population, varied between 8.1 for Chamorros to 17.9 among other Micronesians. The disparity in oral cancer rates among these populations may be due to differences in betel nut chewing patterns. To investigate the effect of chewing patterns, we must be able to conduct studies on multiple Micronesian islands with differing chewing patterns. Previously, we developed a comprehensive betel nut assessment protocol and a protocol for detecting oral lesions on Guam. The overall objectives of the pilot study are to further develop and test these methods, and to demonstrate that they can be applied in a research study of betel nut use on an island other than Guam. A convenience sample of 100 Micronesians (50 men and 50 women) who are long-term betel nut users (regular use for at least 10 years) will be recruited from the island of Saipan in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). We will collect data on betel nut use, presence of oral precancerous lesions, diet, demographics, anthropometry, medical history, and physical activity. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) collect information on betel nut use among study participants and other members of their families, 2) perform oral examinations, and biopsies, as needed, on study participants, 3) measure other health risks among this population, including obesity, high blood pressure, self-reported history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and unhealthy dietary practices and 4) examine associations of duration, frequency, and type of betel nut use with oral pre-cancers and with other health risks. This pilot project will help formulate the research methods for studying betel nut use and disease risk in Micronesia, and will provide the necessary preliminary data for a full multi-island study of betel nut use and the prevalence of oral lesions. Ultimately, a better understanding of these associations will provide important new directions for reduction of health risks through educational efforts and targeted intervention strategies.

"Validation of chair-side biochemical screening instruments for dental caries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The need to develop an accurate chair-side screening instrument for caries activity and caries risk has been long recognized and extensive research work has been done in this area without much success. Our study takes a new approach in solving this problem. This approach is founded on a novel model, the Caries Risk Pyramid (CRP), which summarizes the available knowledge regarding the biology of dental caries. HYPOTHESIS: Based on the CRP model, we hypothesize that measuring the ability of dental plaque and/or saliva to generate alkali from urea, or other salivary substrates, together with the ability to generate acid from sugars, can provide an accurate estimation of an individual's caries status and possibly future caries risk because they summarize the combined effect of other caries risk factors. OBJECTIVE: In order to test this hypothesis we have developed an array of novel, chair-side tests for measuring acid and alkali generation in plaque and in saliva. The objective of this study is to assess the reliability and validity of these tests as screening tools for dental caries and to explore possible ways of combining the results of these tests in order to accurately identify individuals with caries. To accomplish this objective, a cross-sectional study on 200 adult subjects is proposed. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed tests are novel because they consider the ability to generate alkali in plaque as a potential caries risk factor, which has not been previously included in existing multivariate risk assessment models. They are of low cost and give faster results compared to available biological caries risk tests. They do not require dental expertise, which makes them suitable for use by non-dental professionals. Once the tests have been validated in adults, our ultimate goal is to validate them in children and infants as screening tools for Early Childhood Caries (ECC), and ultimately as a predictor of future caries risk, either independently, or in combination with other caries risk factors. Another important potential application for the proposed tests would be the comparison of pre- to post- intervention risk in clinical dental practice, in research, and in community interventions.         Dental caries affects more than 50% of the children (ages 5 to 9 years) and 84% of the adults in the USA and it has a significant impact on the health, quality of life, and on the economy. The prevalence of dental caries is higher in certain ethnic minority populations and in individuals of low socioeconomic status and for that reason the disease is considered as an important health disparity. Interestingly, while the prevalence of dental caries has been declining slowly over the past thirty years in the United States, this decline has not been observed in the youngest age groups, those of 2 to 5 years. These facts demonstrate that the generalized measures currently available for caries prevention and management are not effective for all individuals and that there is a need to identify and address novel risk factors in high-risk populations.  The proposed study is significant because it addresses this important issue. The objective of the study is to validate a new method for identifying individuals who have dental caries, or who are at risk to develop caries in the near future. This method consists of an array of simple tests that can be performed chair-side. The innovation of the method is that these tests measure risk factors that have not been previously considered in the existing caries risk assessment models. The advantages of the proposed tests are low cost and much faster results compared to available caries risk tests. More importantly, they do not require any dental expertise, which makes them suitable for use by non-dental professionals.  Once the tests have been validated in adults, our ultimate goal is to validate them in children and infants as screening tools for Early Childhood Caries (ECC), and ultimately as a predictor of future caries risk, either independently, or in combination with other caries risk factors. They could be used by pediatricians and school nurses to identify infants and small children at an immediate risk to develop ECC, as well as by lay public and health professionals to identify high caries risk individuals and refer them to dentists for appropriate treatment. In addition, the proposed tests could be used for evaluating the effectiveness of preventive and clinical interventions in private dental practice, in research, and in community interventions, by comparing caries risk before and after the interventions.

"Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early childhood caries (ECC) is the most prevalent chronic childhood disease in the U.S., particularly among economically disadvantaged, underserved children. We propose to continue our existing Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health (U54DE014251) and its efforts to understand, prevent, and reduce oral health disparities, with a focus on preventing ECC. The themes of our collaborative, community-based program are (1) to provide the high-quality evidence base for new methods to prevent ECC in populations experiencing oral-health disparities and (2) to identify the most effective dissemination methods for delivering fluoride varnish (FV), an efficacious preventive method. We will actively engage California communities and providers in two large-scale intervention studies utilizing randomized clinical trial (RCT) methodology, stratified by settings, to assess the effectiveness or clinical efficacy of different preventive methods on caries incidence and increment among low-income children. Using the RE-AIM framework, Project 1 will identify the most effective setting (medical, social service agency or dental) to disseminate FV to the greatest number of 1-3-year-old children. Stratifying on setting, a parallel groups practical RCT will be conducted in 24 community-based primary care clinics (CPCCs) from the UCSF primary care collaborative research network, and 24 California Special Supplemental Nutrition Programs for Women, Infants and Children (WICs). Each non-dental site (CPCC or WIC) will be randomized to a program of parental counseling and onsite FV application or to parental counseling and referral to a dentist for child's FV application. We will also compare two automated telephone counseling methods and utilize teledentistry approaches for blinded caries assessments. Project 2 is an intervention study to be conducted in dental and non-dental settings, both affiliated with Federally Qualified Health Centers near the US-Mexico border, to compare the relative caries prevention efficacy of four protocols in 3-6 year-old children: 1) parental oral-health counseling (C) alone; 2) C+ FV; 3) C+ fluoride-releasing, glass ionomer (Gl) sealants applied to primary molars, and 4) C+FV+ Gl. Our Administrative Core, Statistics and Data Coordinating Center, and Community Liaison Program will support our two RCTs and developmental projects. These endeavors, with other education and career development activities, will foster new investigators to increase oral-health-disparity research capacity.

"Early Childhood Caries and Storytelling in American Indian Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in population-based interventions to prevent dental caries, the prevalence of ECC in children is increasing and disproportionately affects children from racial and ethnic minority groups. ECC is a significant public health problem in American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) children: it's highly prevalent, more severe and occurs earlier in the lifespan compared to other race/ethnic groups in the US. This underscores an urgent need for effective, culturally- appropriate oral health promotion, disease prevention and treatment programs for AI/AN children. This project, uses community-based participatory research principles and takes advantage of the strengths of the partnership among the California Tribal Epidemiology Center and the California Dental Support Center, both housed at the California Rural Indian Health Board, and the Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health at the University of California, San Francisco. We will implement an innovative storytelling intervention to prevent ECC by partnering with tribal organizations in three areas in northern California and by specifically targeting mothers because they influence ECC risk factors earliest in the lifespan. The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a culturally-tailored intervention that incorporates key oral health messages in the indigenous practice of storytelling intended to provide education on ECC risk factors and promote positive oral health behaviors. The proposed intervention includes a story told by a traditional storyteller indigenous to California in a talking circle format. The primary research question to be answered is whether this culturally- tailored, novel intervention is a feasible and acceptable one for improving knowledge, beliefs and behaviors regarding ECC among self-identified age 18 and older AI/AN pregnant women or mothers of children aged 0-71 months. The secondary research question is whether positive effects can be detected from the intervention and the specific aim is to document the effects of the structured intervention for increasing knowledge, beliefs, and positive oral health behaviors through pre-test and two post-test surveys. Outcomes will be assessed immediately after the intervention (post-test 1) and 6 months later (post-test 2) to examine maintenance. This project is important because it will help inform future intervention studies that may include both oral health promotion and clinical interventions for families and their communities to reduce ECC in AI/AN populations.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Among American Indians/Alaska Natives, Early Childhood Caries (ECC) begins at younger ages, is more frequent (68% in 2-4 year olds compared to 11% in the general US population; DHHS, 2000) and presents itself more severely than other US populations. The proposal implements a storytelling intervention to prevent ECC by partnering with tribal organizations and by specifically targeting mothers because they influence ECC risk factors earliest in the lifespan. If storytelling in a talking circle format is feasible and acceptable by this target population, then this culturally-appropriate strategy can be further extended to families and the community to promote oral health.           Among American Indians/Alaska Natives, Early Childhood Caries (ECC) begins at younger ages, is more frequent (68% in 2-4 year olds compared to 11% in the general US population; DHHS, 2000) and presents itself more severely than other US populations.

"Integrating Social, Behavioral & Preventive Sciences to Reduce Children's Caries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our long-term goal is to improve the oral health and reduce disparities of children in Hawai'i. We hypothesize that the reach, and impact, of effective school-based caries prevention programs can be quantitatively increased by leveraging social networks to target behavioral change.  1. Significance: 10 million children (>20%) of U.S. elementary school age children have untreated dental decay. The disparity in health is notable, rising to 72% for American Indians/Native Americans.  Effective school-based preventions are available but underutilized or unavailable. In Hawai'i there are: an abundance of dentists, but few accepting Medicaid; caries rates exceeding national averages; and no school-based caries prevention programs.  2. Innovation:Integrating social network analysis, behavior change and caries prevention has not before been attempted. If successful, a state-wide caries prevention could facilitate exceeding the goals of Healthy People 2020 prior to 2020.  3. Approach: Generate MOP and preliminary data. The specific aims are to:  Create a manual of procedures (MOP) for pilot program, based on the NIDCR model, and modified from the PI's current successful, but independent, programs focusing social network analysis, behavioral change, and caries prevention.  Carry out pilot program to generate and analyze preliminary data, working with two after school organizations. We will determine the social network and behavioral intent of all site coordinators (~100), and both parents and children in 4 pilot schools (~400 parents and children). Two sets of school's directors, parents, and children will receive targeted behavior change (experimental); the other two sets will receive no behavior change (control). Children in all four schools will receive comprehensive caries prevention. The primary outcome will be program impact, defined by RE-AIM.  Prepare U01 application. We will use outcomes, RE-Aim, Markov Chain/Monte Carlo modeling, economic assessments, and power calculations to generate predictive models. These will allow us to revise the MOP and prepare a U01 application for implementation across the Hawai'ian Islands.  4. Investigators: Four experts in unique content areas will collaborate in this team science program, coordinating expertise in social network analysis, behavioral intent and change, caries prevention, and statistical and economic analysis.  5. Environment: Hawai'i is a small state with substantial health care needs and no school-based caries prevention program. The proposed program therefore coalesces an environment with high need, and investigators from institutions with extraordinary depth.        To improve the oral health and reduce disparities of children in Hawaii, we will implement an effective school-based caries prevention program that leverages social networks to effect social change.

"Predicting Caries Risk in Underserved Toddlers in Primary Healthcare Settings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dental caries, the most common chronic disease of childhood, is a largely preventable disease. This proposal focuses on addressing inequities in dental caries experience among preschool aged U.S. children. It has been inspired by the shift and increase in dental caries among subsets of the population (i.e., 2-5 year old children, especially from underserved/minority population groups) that calls for a greater focus on targeted healthcare. In an environment of increasing healthcare costs and resource constraints, this approach is paramount in addressing oral health disparities. Because children have multiple well-child pediatric visits in the early years of life, many lower socioeconomic status (SES) and minority children have much greater access to medical care than to dental care. Our long-term goal is to reduce disparities in dental caries experience in young children in the U.S. by developing effective risk-based caries preventive and therapeutic strategies to be delivered through new models for oral health care, including primary medical healthcare settings. However, the problem is that currently there is no practical, validated and easily-scored tool practitioners can use to accurately and reliably assess, and effectively triage children at the highest risk for caries. Such an urgently needed tool will be developed in this proposed research. Thus, the objective of this study is to validate a caries risk questionnaire in order to develop a practical and easily-scored caries risk tool for use in primary medical healthcare settings to identify young, diverse U.S. children (1-4 years of age) with the highest risk for the development of caries. This will be accomplished by having the parents of 1,326 infants complete a caries risk questionnaire and by performing caries examinations on the children at baseline (child's age 12 + 3 months old), and again at 18 months (child's age 30 + 3 months) and 36 months after the baseline (child's age 48 + 3 months) to monitor the caries disease process, and how well the risk tool predicts caries risk status as the child ages. A great strength of this proposal is that it involves four experienced investigator groups who offer strong partnerships between medical and dental teams, and three study sites with well established primary care medical research networks that provide access and facilitate follow up to a variety of at-risk, diverse populations, including ethnic and racial minorities and low SES groups. Each study site also has an NIH Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA), and will benefit from infrastructure and experience in longitudinal clinical translational research. The significance of this work is that identification of high caries risk children in primary healthcare settings allows cost-effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed, targeted and used in these settings to prevent early childhood caries. This will have immediate broad impact and influence on existing dental and medical policies and programs regarding screening and prevention of dental caries among young children from diverse disadvantaged and underserved subgroups, in primary medical and dental pediatric healthcare settings.          The relevance of this collaborative, innovative and high impact project between physicians and dentists is that it will result in a valid, reliable, and practical (easy to score) caries risk assessment tool for the identification of high caries risk infants/toddlers in primary medical healthcare settings allowing for cost effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed and targeted to prevent early childhood caries, and help reduce disparities in caries experience.

"University of Guam/Cancer Research Center of Hawaii Partnership (2 of 2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Oral cancer is the sixth leading cancer in the world, and ranks in the top three cancers in countries where betel nut (also known as areca nut) chewing is common. In Micronesia, a group of Pacific Islands where betel nut is frequently chewed, the risk of oral cancer is elevated, but quite variable across populations. For the period 1985-1998 (age-adjusted to the 1988 U.S. population), the prevalence per 100,000 ranged from 4.2 in Chuuk to 31.8 in Yap. In Guam, the incidence of mouth cancer per 100,000 population for the period 1997-2003, age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. population, varied between 8.1 for Chamorros to 17.9 among other Micronesians. The disparity in oral cancer rates among these populations may be due to differences in betel nut chewing patterns. To investigate the effect of chewing patterns, we must be able to conduct studies on multiple Micronesian islands with differing chewing patterns. Previously, we developed a comprehensive betel nut assessment protocol and a protocol for detecting oral lesions on Guam. The overall objectives of the pilot study are to further develop and test these methods, and to demonstrate that they can be applied in a research study of betel nut use on an island other than Guam. A convenience sample of 100 Micronesians (50 men and 50 women) who are long-term betel nut users (regular use for at least 10 years) will be recruited from the island of Saipan in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). We will collect data on betel nut use, presence of oral precancerous lesions, diet, demographics, anthropometry, medical history, and physical activity. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) collect information on betel nut use among study participants and other members of their families, 2) perform oral examinations, and biopsies, as needed, on study participants, 3) measure other health risks among this population, including obesity, high blood pressure, self-reported history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and unhealthy dietary practices and 4) examine associations of duration, frequency, and type of betel nut use with oral pre-cancers and with other health risks. This pilot project will help formulate the research methods for studying betel nut use and disease risk in Micronesia, and will provide the necessary preliminary data for a full multi-island study of betel nut use and the prevalence of oral lesions. Ultimately, a better understanding of these associations will provide important new directions for reduction of health risks through educational efforts and targeted intervention strategies.              ",University of Guam/Cancer Research Center of Hawaii Partnership (2 of 2),8309794,U54CA143728,"['Age ', ' Anthropometry ', ' Areca ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Biopsy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Grant ', ' Guam ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Island ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' chews ', ' chewed ', ' Chewing ', ' Mastication ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Micronesia ', ' Nuts ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Pacific Islands ', ' Peer Review ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' mouth lesion ', ' oral lesion ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' Area ', ' Physical activity ', ' Lesion ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Medical History ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Northern Mariana Islands ', ' Oral Examination ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Oral ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Training and Education ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Premalignant ', ' Research Training ', ' CRCH ', ' Cancer Research Center of Hawaii ', ' Process ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' demographics ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF GUAM,U54,2012,1537363,0.2111930028514738
"Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health will focus on oral health concerns of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) and will be known as the Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR). The Principal Investigator is Judith E. N. Albino, PhD, President Emeritus of the University of Colorado and Professor, American Indian/Alaska Native Programs (AIANP) and Craniofacial Biology, and a health psychologist. She will lead the Research Program Administrative Center (RPAC). Dr. Spero Manson, PhD, Professor and Head, AIANP, and a medical anthropologist, will serve as Co-Investigator and lead the Community Liaison and Dissemination Core within RPAC. Biostatistician William Henderson, PhD, Professor, Colorado Health Outcomes Program, will lead the Statistics and Data Coordinating Center (S&DCC). CNOHR takes a comprehensive approach to oral health disparities in the long term, with an initial focus on oral infections and key roles of behavioral factors and comorbidities. The interdisciplinary team includes scientists trained in anthropology, biostatistics, dentistry, economics, medicine, psychology, and public health, supported by experienced project management and technology teams. The three initial projects focus on caries and periodontal disease, and intervene by extending current services and their use as well as adding prevention services and oral health promotion. The first Research Component (RC1) tests an intervention with pregnant women/mothers of newborns on a Northern Plains Reservation, which is focused on the use of motivational interviewing in prevention of ECC. RC2 is a randomized clinical trial of two methods for treating periodontal disease in Southwestern American Indians who also have Type 2 diabetes mellitus. RC3 is a test of a service delivery intervention in which tribal/community members are trained to apply fluoride varnish and deliver personalized oral health education for 3-5 year old children and their parents enrolled in reservation-based Indian Head Start programs. A Developmental Research Program will offer opportunities to pilot work suggested by new investigators, by community participation and planning activities, and by preliminary results of major projects. A focus on dissemination will include activities aimed at increasing community awareness and influencing health policy. Considerable prior experience with the participating tribes and communities has shaped the CNOHR methods and approaches, and ongoing community participation in planning will continue to influence the implementation of the RCs. A robust program of training and career development experiences will include mentoring and support for students at the secondary, undergraduate, professional and graduate, and post-doctoral levels, with emphasis on recruiting AI/AN investigators to oral health disparities research.     ",Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR),8266907,U54DE019259,"['American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Anthropology ', ' Awareness ', ' Biology ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dentistry ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Economics ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks) ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-6 weeks old ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Parents ', ' periodontium disorder ', ' periodontium disease ', ' periodontal disorder ', ' Parodontosis ', ' Periodontal Diseases ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' community planning ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Shapes ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' oral infectious ', ' infection mouth ', ' oral infection ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Services ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' Head Start ', ' Head Start Program ', ' prevention service ', ' member ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Prevention ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Reservations ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' reservation-based ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' tribal communities ', ' tribal community ', ' northern plains ', ' Outcome ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 year old ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,U54,2012,4288600,0.273548267273214
"Multi-Center Assessment of Health Literacy and Oral Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Healthcare is becoming more complicated and demanding each year. Futuristic technologies, genetic engineering, highly specific drugs, complex insurance plans, and confusing and often conflicting messages from the media all add to the problem. Knowing how to access, understand, and use information about healthcare (i.e., health literacy) is becoming more of a challenge for everyone. According to the Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health in America, profound and consequential oral health disparities exist in the United States today. Epidemiological assessments reveal that low-income and minority populations have the highest incidence and prevalence of oral diseases and disorders. Given that these groups are also most likely to have limited health literacy skills means that they are especially vulnerable to the complications of the healthcare system and most in need of assistance. In order for effective interventions to be developed and implemented, however, a clearer understanding of the associations between limited health literacy and oral health need to be gained. At the heart of that understanding is knowing the ways that different health literacy skills (e.g., reading comprehension, numeracy, conceptual knowledge) work individually and as a group to support oral healthcare decision making and, ultimately, oral health outcomes. These findings would improve oral health and general well-being, and reduce disparities for millions in the nation. The proposed research project brings an experienced multidisciplinary team together from Baltimore, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Washington, DC to comprehensively study these associations between health literacy and oral health. A cross-section of dental patients presenting to three dental clinics in Maryland and California will be recruited and a series of assessments will be administered during face-to-face encounters. These data will also be linked to clinical records so that retrospective and prospective use of dental care services, including expenditures and utilization, may be concurrently assessed. The specific aims of the project include: 1) determining the structural relations between health literacy, oral healthcare decision making, and oral health status; 2) determining the extent to which four different measures of health literacy represent unique skills; and 3) determining the extent to which four different measures of health literacy are associated with oral health, independent of selected sociodemographic and healthcare-related covariates. The proposed project is significant because it represents the first to comprehensively study the associations between health literacy and oral health. It is also significant because it will serve as a guide for comprehensive assessments of health literacy and other health outcomes, outside of dentistry. The project is innovative because it combines multiple measures of health literacy, healthcare decision-making, and oral health outcomes into a single investigation. It is also innovative because it incorporates powerful and contemporary statistical analyses that will reveal the relative contribution of each variable to the overall model, while controlling for the aforementioned covariates.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful completion of the proposed project will result in a comprehensive understanding of the extent to which health literacy is associated with oral health. Gaining this understanding will lead to interventions aimed at improving oral health and reducing oral health disparities, benefitting millions of low-income and minority Americans. In addition, the proposed project will serve as a model for comprehensive studies of the links between health literacy and other health outcomes, beyond dentistry.

"Scientific Basis of Iodine-Fluoride Varnish in Preventing Dental Caries     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Topical fluorides have been the mainstay in the prevention of dental caries for decades. However, topical fluoride alone is not enough to thwart tooth decay in high-risk populations. The purpose of this Phase I application is to determine the technical and scientific feasibility of using a combination povidone-iodine (PVP-I)-5% sodium fluoride (NaF) varnish as a potential commercial product to prevent dental caries. The research will be conducted by the small business firm ADP Silver Dental Arrest, LLC, in collaboration with experienced researchers at the University of Washington Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities. The Premier Dental Products Company will prepare the varnish to the specifications of the applicant at no cost to the grant.  The Specific Aims of this Phase I SBIR are to:  (1) Demonstrate that a new povidone iodine-sodium fluoride varnish has antimicrobial activity and fluoride bioavailability and enamel remineralization ability.  (a) Use the in vitro moel developed by Castillo and colleagues to determine the  bioavailability of fluoride and iodine release from an experimental povidone-iodine-  sodium fluoride varnish;  (b) Use an in vitro model of Tanzer and colleagues to assess the additive  (indifferent), potentially synergistic, or potentially antagonistic effects of sodium fluoride  and povidone-iodine against Streptococcus mutans using the criteria of Eliopoulos and Moellering;  (c) Use a slight modification the Featherstone laboratory pH cycling model to test remineralization.  (2) Assess the esthetic and organoleptic properties of the new povidone iodine-sodium  fluoride varnish. Caries researchers for sometime have suggested strategies that combine an antiseptic with topical fluoride to reduce or eliminate the oral cariogenic bacteria reservoir in addition to topical fluoride which primarily remineralizes teeth enamel. Povidone-iodine is an FDA-approved and widely used bactericidal antiseptic. For the oral flora, iodine has preferential activities against streptococcl species. Moreover, iodine's effectiveness may last as long as six months.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this application we propose to: (1) use an in vitro model to determine the bioavailability of fluoride and iodine release from a povidone-iodine-sodium fluoride varnish; (2) use an in vitro model to assess the additive, potentially synergistic, or antagonistic effects of sodium fluoride and povidone-iodine against Streptococcus mutans, the primary pathogens in human dental caries; 3) use a pH cycling model to test remineralization; and 4) assess the organoleptic characteristics of test varnishes.                ",Scientific Basis of Iodine-Fluoride Varnish in Preventing Dental Caries,8519157,R43DE022986,"['Acids ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Topical Antiinfective Agents ', ' Topical Anti-Infective Agents ', ' Local Antiinfective Agents ', ' Antiseptics ', ' Local Anti-Infective Agents ', ' Bacteria ', ' bacterial disease ', ' Bacterial Infections ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth enamel ', ' Enamel ', ' Dental Enamel ', ' Dental Plaque ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Esthetics ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Fluorides ', ' Topical Fluorides ', ' Grant ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' I- element ', ' Iodine ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' Marketing ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Polyvinylpyrrolidone Iodine ', ' PVP-Iodine ', ' PVP-I ', ' Betadine ', ' 2-Pyrrolidinone, 1-ethenyl-, homopolymer, compd. with iodine ', ' Povidone-Iodine ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Ag element ', ' Silver ', ' Sodium fluoride (NaF) ', ' Sodium Fluoride ', ' S.mutans ', ' S. mutans ', ' Streptococcus mutans ', ' Testing ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Universities ', ' Varnish ', ' Washington ', ' dry mouth ', ' aptyalism ', ' Mouth Dryness ', ' Hyposalivation ', ' Asialia ', ' Xerostomia ', ' Businesses ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Dental ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Fostering ', ' Systemic infection ', ' antibacterial ', ' anti-bacterial ', ' Antibacterial Agents ', ' Anti-Bacterial Agents ', ' Collaborations ', ' Oral ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' oral flora ', ' oral bacteria ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' Pathogenicity Factors ', ' Virulence Factors ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Glycolysis Inhibition ', ' in vitro Model ', ' in vivo ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' remineralization ', ' bactericidal ', ' bactericide ', ' cariogenic bacteria ', ' cost ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Caries prevention ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' anti-microbial ', ' antimicrobial ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic disadvantage ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' FDA approved ', ' ']",NIDCR,"ADP SILVER DENTAL ARREST, LLC",R43,2013,117198,0.23741859541308064
"Validating OCT and Raman spectroscopy for assessment of tooth de/remineralization     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries continues to be prevalent in children and youth, with significant oral health disparities existing in some population groups. This disease arises when the balance between pathological factors (e.g. cariogenic bacteria) and protective factors (e.g. saliva flow) is tipped in favour of demineralization. The prevalence of caries suggests that the disease is not being effectively managed with an emphasis traditionally on restorative procedures where caries lesions are already serious. Dentistry is undergoing a paradigm shift away from surgical treatment of caries to a medical model of disease prevention and management. This change aims to address the disease cause with minimally invasive CAries Management By Risk Assessment (CAMBRA) efforts. For this paradigm to be successful, dentists need better tools to detect early lesions. Early detection will allow dentists to monitor and counsel patients in managing caries risk factors to help prevent disease progression. We hypothesize that the combination of morphological and biochemical information provided by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and polarized Raman spectroscopy (PRS), respectively, can provide clinicians with an improved tool to detect and assess early caries lesions as well as to be used for both short- and long-term monitoring for better caries management. The overall objective of this competitive renewal proposal is to develop a novel software and hardware clinical platform based on a combined OCT-PRS intra-oral probe for early dental caries detection and assessment. To achieve this goal we plan to: 1) establish a clinic-friendly software platform to derive caries relevant parameters from the OCT-PRS data, 2) develop combined OCT-PRS caries assessment intra-oral probes for proximal and occlusal surfaces, and finally 3) validate the hardware and software for clinical utility in caries detectio and assessment through two small scale clinical studies. Our research will provide novel automated software algorithms to provide clinicians with measures of caries presence, lesion extent, quantitative assessment of caries lesion activity and mineralization status during the examination of the patient. The proposed developments and evidence-based findings will support a paradigm shift in treating caries as a disease. This research supports the new US Healthy People 2020 program in which an oral health objective is to reduce caries and untreated decay among children and adolescents.          Dental decay (dental caries) is preventable and curable, yet it is among the most common chronic diseases affecting children in the USA with significant oral health disparities existing in some population groups. The proposed research will provide clinicians with improved tools to detect and assess early dental caries for better caries management. This research supports the new US Healthy People 2020 program in which an oral health objective is to reduce caries and untreated decay among children and adolescents.

"Addressing Oral Health Disparities in Medicaid-Enrolled Special Needs Children wi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed application for a K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award is being submitted by Donald Chi, a dentist with advanced clinical training in pediatric dentistry and dental public health. Dr. Chi is currently a PhD candidate in Oral Health Services Research at the University of Iowa. This award will allow Dr. Chi to meet his long-term goal of becoming an independently-funded clinician scholar with an interdisciplinary research program that addresses disparities in oral health and access to dental care for children with special health care needs. His immediate career goal is to extend his dissertation research on access to dental care for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition by developing, testing, and refining a new multi-level conceptual model on access. Dr. Chi proposes the following five aims related to his career development: (1) improve conceptual understanding of access to care for low-income children with special needs; (2) learn and apply new discipline- and theory-based research methods; (3) collect pilot data for a future R01 application; (4) improve writing skills and professional networks; and (5) develop mentorship skills. In addition, he will test the central hypothesis of the proposed research plan - that the health care system-, community-, provider-, family-, and child-level determinants of access to dental care are complex, interrelated, and vary in relative importance depending on type of access being examined - through the following three research aims: (1) identify the multi-level determinants of access to dental care for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition using administrative data; (2) evaluate the extent to which behavioral factors are associated with access to dental care for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition using survey data; and (3) assess the relationship between access to dental care and the level of unmet dental need for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition using clinical data. This research will guide future studies on access and help in the development of multi-level interventions that will improve the oral health of Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition. The proposed career development and research activities will take place in highly supportive, research-intensive environments. Peter Milgrom, DDS and Colleen Huebner, PhD, national experts in their respective fields and Directors of the Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities at the University of Washington School of Dentistry, will supervise Dr. Chi's research and career development activities. In addition, Dr. Chi will receive consulting advice from John Neff, MD (co-developer of Clinical Risk Grouping software); Lloyd Mancl, PhD (biostatistician); and Elizabeth Momany, PhD (Iowa Medicaid data expert). Finally, all activities will be overseen by an External Advisory Committee consisting of Jeffrey Murray, MD (Professor of Pediatrics, University of Iowa); Peter Damiano, DDS, MPH (Professor of Preventive and Community Dentistry, University of Iowa); and Diane Martin, PhD (Professor of Health Services, University of Washington). This cross-institutional, interdisciplinary mentorship team will facilitate Dr. Chi's natural progression from current research experiences to the mentored clinical scientist development phase and then to independence.       Public Health Relevance: There is a dearth of research on access to dental care for publicly-insured children with special health care needs. This project seeks to identify and understand the multi-level determinants of access to dental care for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition. Our work will be used to develop clinical and policy strategies designed to reduce oral health disparities and to improve the oral health of these vulnerable children.

"Parental preventive behaviors and oral health in Latino children     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tooth decay (caries) is the most common childhood disease in the United States, affecting 28% of children 2-5 years old, and costing the United States over $35 billion dollars every year. Latino children are more likely to be affected and are more likely to have severe, extensive and untreated decay. A linguistically and culturally appropriate intervention, called Contra Caries, was developed based on prior qualitative research with Latino families and Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). SCT is a health behavior theory that outlines constructs, such as behavioral capability, outcome expectations, self-efficacy, and environment that have been associated with many behaviors. However, the SCT constructs have not fully been explored for oral hygiene behaviors. The Contra Caries intervention (NIH grant # R21DE019210, Barker PI) was piloted with rural, low-income Spanish-speaking parent/caregivers of children 1-5 years old and found to be well- accepted and feasible to implement. But Contra Caries has never been evaluated for effects on behavior, nor was the Contra Caries evaluation part of the original grant application. The overall objectives of this proposal are to create new knowledge and translate that into evidence- based interventions for improved early childhood oral health. The goals of this proposal are to better understand the cognitive factors influencing parental oral health protective behaviors, such as toothbrushing, and to evaluate whether Contra Caries improved the quantity and quality of such behaviors. Using data from the Contra Caries study population, the aims of the current proposal are: Aim 1: To determine if survey questions measuring behavioral capability, outcome expectations, self-efficacy, and environment are positively associated with protective behaviors especially, but not limited to, regular tooth brushing of children's teeth. Aim 2: To determine if the Contra Caries education intervention improves quantity and quality of protective behaviors, such as toothbrushing of children's teeth. The knowledge gained from Aims 1 and 2 will provide the necessary preliminary data to inform future intervention research, such as design of a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the Contra Caries education intervention. Skills gained from this proposal will create a methodological skill base to carry out Aims 1 and 2 as well as prepare the applicant for her long term career goals. The training objective is to complete doctoral training in order to become an independent investigator seeking to understand and reduce disparities in oral health, especially focusing on Latino populations and on early childhood. The proposed training plan will be performed as a part of UCSF's doctoral program in Epidemiology & Translational Science including epidemiology research design and methods coursework and independent studies in oral health disparities and translational science with leading researchers in these fields.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tooth decay is the most common childhood disease in the United States, affecting 28% of all children 2-5 years old; it costs the United States over $35 billion dollars every year. Because low-income, Mexican- American, migrant, and rural children are disproportionately affected, they particularly stand to benefit from interventions that protect and improve their oral health. This research uses existing data from an education intervention to explore psychological influences on protective parental behaviors, such as toothbrushing, and assesses the effectiveness of this new intervention at improving such behaviors.            ",Parental preventive behaviors and oral health in Latino children,8527587,F31DE023282,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' Preschool Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Fluorides ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Language ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Migrant ', ' Nomads ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Parents ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Solutions ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' tooth brushing ', ' Toothbrushing ', ' Toothpaste ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' base ', ' career ', ' tooth brushes ', ' toothbrush ', ' improved ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Mexican ', ' Rural ', ' sugar ', ' Funding ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavior measurement ', ' early childhood ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Population Study ', ' Modeling ', ' parent influence ', ' parental influence ', ' theories ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Preventive ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Intake ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' protective behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 year old ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F31,2013,36108,0.22062631742025354
"Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health will focus on oral health concerns of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) and will be known as the Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR). The Principal Investigator is Judith E. N. Albino, PhD, President Emeritus of the University of Colorado and Professor, American Indian/Alaska Native Programs (AIANP) and Craniofacial Biology, and a health psychologist. She will lead the Research Program Administrative Center (RPAC). Dr. Spero Manson, PhD, Professor and Head, AIANP, and a medical anthropologist, will serve as Co-Investigator and lead the Community Liaison and Dissemination Core within RPAC. Biostatistician William Henderson, PhD, Professor, Colorado Health Outcomes Program, will lead the Statistics and Data Coordinating Center (S&DCC). CNOHR takes a comprehensive approach to oral health disparities in the long term, with an initial focus on oral infections and key roles of behavioral factors and comorbidities. The interdisciplinary team includes scientists trained in anthropology, biostatistics, dentistry, economics, medicine, psychology, and public health, supported by experienced project management and technology teams. The three initial projects focus on caries and periodontal disease, and intervene by extending current services and their use as well as adding prevention services and oral health promotion. The first Research Component (RC1) tests an intervention with pregnant women/mothers of newborns on a Northern Plains Reservation, which is focused on the use of motivational interviewing in prevention of ECC. RC2 is a randomized clinical trial of two methods for treating periodontal disease in Southwestern American Indians who also have Type 2 diabetes mellitus. RC3 is a test of a service delivery intervention in which tribal/community members are trained to apply fluoride varnish and deliver personalized oral health education for 3-5 year old children and their parents enrolled in reservation-based Indian Head Start programs. A Developmental Research Program will offer opportunities to pilot work suggested by new investigators, by community participation and planning activities, and by preliminary results of major projects. A focus on dissemination will include activities aimed at increasing community awareness and influencing health policy. Considerable prior experience with the participating tribes and communities has shaped the CNOHR methods and approaches, and ongoing community participation in planning will continue to influence the implementation of the RCs. A robust program of training and career development experiences will include mentoring and support for students at the secondary, undergraduate, professional and graduate, and post-doctoral levels, with emphasis on recruiting AI/AN investigators to oral health disparities research.     ",Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR),8467583,U54DE019259,"['American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Anthropology ', ' Awareness ', ' Biology ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dentistry ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Economics ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks) ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-6 weeks old ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Parents ', ' periodontium disorder ', ' periodontium disease ', ' periodontal disorder ', ' Parodontosis ', ' Periodontal Diseases ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' community planning ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Shapes ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' oral infectious ', ' infection mouth ', ' oral infection ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Services ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' Head Start ', ' Head Start Program ', ' prevention service ', ' member ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Prevention ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Reservations ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' reservation-based ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' tribal communities ', ' tribal community ', ' northern plains ', ' Outcome ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 year old ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,U54,2013,2839326,0.273548267273214
"Predicting Caries Risk in Underserved Toddlers in Primary Healthcare Settings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dental caries, the most common chronic disease of childhood, is a largely preventable disease. This proposal focuses on addressing inequities in dental caries experience among preschool aged U.S. children. It has been inspired by the shift and increase in dental caries among subsets of the population (i.e., 2-5 year old children, especially from underserved/minority population groups) that calls for a greater focus on targeted healthcare. In an environment of increasing healthcare costs and resource constraints, this approach is paramount in addressing oral health disparities. Because children have multiple well-child pediatric visits in the early years of life, many lower socioeconomic status (SES) and minority children have much greater access to medical care than to dental care. Our long-term goal is to reduce disparities in dental caries experience in young children in the U.S. by developing effective risk-based caries preventive and therapeutic strategies to be delivered through new models for oral health care, including primary medical healthcare settings. However, the problem is that currently there is no practical, validated and easily-scored tool practitioners can use to accurately and reliably assess, and effectively triage children at the highest risk for caries. Such an urgently needed tool will be developed in this proposed research. Thus, the objective of this study is to validate a caries risk questionnaire in order to develop a practical and easily-scored caries risk tool for use in primary medical healthcare settings to identify young, diverse U.S. children (1-4 years of age) with the highest risk for the development of caries. This will be accomplished by having the parents of 1,326 infants complete a caries risk questionnaire and by performing caries examinations on the children at baseline (child's age 12 + 3 months old), and again at 18 months (child's age 30 + 3 months) and 36 months after the baseline (child's age 48 + 3 months) to monitor the caries disease process, and how well the risk tool predicts caries risk status as the child ages. A great strength of this proposal is that it involves four experienced investigator groups who offer strong partnerships between medical and dental teams, and three study sites with well established primary care medical research networks that provide access and facilitate follow up to a variety of at-risk, diverse populations, including ethnic and racial minorities and low SES groups. Each study site also has an NIH Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA), and will benefit from infrastructure and experience in longitudinal clinical translational research. The significance of this work is that identification of high caries risk children in primary healthcare settings allows cost-effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed, targeted and used in these settings to prevent early childhood caries. This will have immediate broad impact and influence on existing dental and medical policies and programs regarding screening and prevention of dental caries among young children from diverse disadvantaged and underserved subgroups, in primary medical and dental pediatric healthcare settings.          The relevance of this collaborative, innovative and high impact project between physicians and dentists is that it will result in a valid, reliable, and practical (easy to score) caries risk assessment tool for the identification of high caries risk infants/toddlers in primary medical healthcare settings allowing for cost effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed and targeted to prevent early childhood caries, and help reduce disparities in caries experience.

"Early Childhood Caries and Storytelling in American Indian Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in population-based interventions to prevent dental caries, the prevalence of ECC in children is increasing and disproportionately affects children from racial and ethnic minority groups. ECC is a significant public health problem in American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) children: it's highly prevalent, more severe and occurs earlier in the lifespan compared to other race/ethnic groups in the US. This underscores an urgent need for effective, culturally- appropriate oral health promotion, disease prevention and treatment programs for AI/AN children. This project, uses community-based participatory research principles and takes advantage of the strengths of the partnership among the California Tribal Epidemiology Center and the California Dental Support Center, both housed at the California Rural Indian Health Board, and the Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health at the University of California, San Francisco. We will implement an innovative storytelling intervention to prevent ECC by partnering with tribal organizations in three areas in northern California and by specifically targeting mothers because they influence ECC risk factors earliest in the lifespan. The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a culturally-tailored intervention that incorporates key oral health messages in the indigenous practice of storytelling intended to provide education on ECC risk factors and promote positive oral health behaviors. The proposed intervention includes a story told by a traditional storyteller indigenous to California in a talking circle format. The primary research question to be answered is whether this culturally- tailored, novel intervention is a feasible and acceptable one for improving knowledge, beliefs and behaviors regarding ECC among self-identified age 18 and older AI/AN pregnant women or mothers of children aged 0-71 months. The secondary research question is whether positive effects can be detected from the intervention and the specific aim is to document the effects of the structured intervention for increasing knowledge, beliefs, and positive oral health behaviors through pre-test and two post-test surveys. Outcomes will be assessed immediately after the intervention (post-test 1) and 6 months later (post-test 2) to examine maintenance. This project is important because it will help inform future intervention studies that may include both oral health promotion and clinical interventions for families and their communities to reduce ECC in AI/AN populations.          Among American Indians/Alaska Natives, Early Childhood Caries (ECC) begins at younger ages, is more frequent (68% in 2-4 year olds compared to 11% in the general US population; DHHS, 2000) and presents itself more severely than other US populations. The proposal implements a storytelling intervention to prevent ECC by partnering with tribal organizations and by specifically targeting mothers because they influence ECC risk factors earliest in the lifespan. If storytelling in a talking circle format is feasible and acceptable by this target population, then this culturally-appropriate strategy can be further extended to families and the community to promote oral health.

"Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health will focus on oral health concerns of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) and will be known as the Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR). The Principal Investigator is Judith E. N. Albino, PhD, President Emeritus of the University of Colorado and Professor, American Indian/Alaska Native Programs (AIANP) and Craniofacial Biology, and a health psychologist. She will lead the Research Program Administrative Center (RPAC). Dr. Spero Manson, PhD, Professor and Head, AIANP, and a medical anthropologist, will serve as Co-Investigator and lead the Community Liaison and Dissemination Core within RPAC. Biostatistician William Henderson, PhD, Professor, Colorado Health Outcomes Program, will lead the Statistics and Data Coordinating Center (S&DCC). CNOHR takes a comprehensive approach to oral health disparities in the long term, with an initial focus on oral infections and key roles of behavioral factors and comorbidities. The interdisciplinary team includes scientists trained in anthropology, biostatistics, dentistry, economics, medicine, psychology, and public health, supported by experienced project management and technology teams. The three initial projects focus on caries and periodontal disease, and intervene by extending current services and their use as well as adding prevention services and oral health promotion. The first Research Component (RC1) tests an intervention with pregnant women/mothers of newborns on a Northern Plains Reservation, which is focused on the use of motivational interviewing in prevention of ECC. RC2 is a randomized clinical trial of two methods for treating periodontal disease in Southwestern American Indians who also have Type 2 diabetes mellitus. RC3 is a test of a service delivery intervention in which tribal/community members are trained to apply fluoride varnish and deliver personalized oral health education for 3-5 year old children and their parents enrolled in reservation-based Indian Head Start programs. A Developmental Research Program will offer opportunities to pilot work suggested by new investigators, by community participation and planning activities, and by preliminary results of major projects. A focus on dissemination will include activities aimed at increasing community awareness and influencing health policy. Considerable prior experience with the participating tribes and communities has shaped the CNOHR methods and approaches, and ongoing community participation in planning will continue to influence the implementation of the RCs. A robust program of training and career development experiences will include mentoring and support for students at the secondary, undergraduate, professional and graduate, and post-doctoral levels, with emphasis on recruiting AI/AN investigators to oral health disparities research.

"University of Guam/Cancer Research Center of Hawaii Partnership (1 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Oral cancer is the sixth leading cancer in the world, and ranks in the top three cancers in countries where betel nut (also known as areca nut) chewing is common. In Micronesia, a group of Pacific Islands where betel nut is frequently chewed, the risk of oral cancer is elevated, but quite variable across populations. For the period 1985-1998 (age-adjusted to the 1988 U.S. population), the prevalence per 100,000 ranged from 4.2 in Chuuk to 31.8 in Yap. In Guam, the incidence of mouth cancer per 100,000 population for the period 1997-2003, age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. population, varied between 8.1 for Chamorros to 17.9 among other Micronesians. The disparity in oral cancer rates among these populations may be due to differences in betel nut chewing patterns. To investigate the effect of chewing patterns, we must be able to conduct studies on multiple Micronesian islands with differing chewing patterns. Previously, we developed a comprehensive betel nut assessment protocol and a protocol for detecting oral lesions on Guam. The overall objectives of the pilot study are to further develop and test these methods, and to demonstrate that they can be applied in a research study of betel nut use on an island other than Guam. A convenience sample of 100 Micronesians (50 men and 50 women) who are long-term betel nut users (regular use for at least 10 years) will be recruited from the island of Saipan in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). We will collect data on betel nut use, presence of oral precancerous lesions, diet, demographics, anthropometry, medical history, and physical activity. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) collect information on betel nut use among study participants and other members of their families, 2) perform oral examinations, and biopsies, as needed, on study participants, 3) measure other health risks among this population, including obesity, high blood pressure, self-reported history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and unhealthy dietary practices and 4) examine associations of duration, frequency, and type of betel nut use with oral pre-cancers and with other health risks. This pilot project will help formulate the research methods for studying betel nut use and disease risk in Micronesia, and will provide the necessary preliminary data for a full multi-island study of betel nut use and the prevalence of oral lesions. Ultimately, a better understanding of these associations will provide important new directions for reduction of health risks through educational efforts and targeted intervention strategies.

"Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries is a very different disease than it was forty years ago. While caries is declining in general, caries rates in young children (ages 2-5) in the US have been increasing (US GAO, 2008). There is also increasing disparity seen with severe caries occurring disproportionately in the poor and disenfranchised. Notably, individuals living in selected areas of Appalachia have some of the worst oral health indicators in the U.S. The current proposal is a renewal of our ongoing project (R01-DE-014899) to identify factors contributing to the oral health disparity seen in northern Appalachia versus the rest of the nation. The guiding philosophy of our project has been and continues to be that developing strategies to address this disparity requires simultaneous study of multiple risk components (ideally within families) to determine their roles, interactions among them, and their transmissibility patterns. The long-term goal of our program of research is to determine why the Northern Appalachian population is at increased risk of oral disease so that targeted preventive interventions can be designed.  One of the most notable results from the first project period was that the disparity in dental caries is evident at an early age; the prevalence of total caries experience in 2 - 5 year olds from our Northern Appalachian study was 144% of the prevalence of comparable children in NHANES, with this disparity diminishing in later age groups. Importantly, we also identified genes in multiple categories (tooth structure, taste preference, and salivary proteins) that are associated with either increased caries risk or protection, sometimes showing different effects in different age groups and/or dentitions. Finally, our microbiological and genetic studies of S. mutans demonstrated extreme genetic diversity and showed that S. mutans alone is unlikely to be the sole caries risk factor; more likely, dynamic changes in the oral microbial ecology are responsible for elevated disease risk. Based on the cross-sectional results, we hypothesize that the mechanisms that lead to disparities develop within the first two years of life. Implicit in this hypothesis is the need to address these questions longitudinally among children before and during the time of greatest risk from three different perspectives:  psychosocial, genetic, and microbiological.  The aims of this renewal include development of a longitudinal study of dental caries development early in life by recruiting a cohort of pregnant women. We will then utilize both the data collected in the first project period, and new data from the longitudinal cohort to follow up the significant environmental, genetic and microbial results from the first project period.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite years of study and preventive dentistry, dental caries in young children has been markedly increasing. The goal of this study is to continue our program of studying oral health in Appalachia, in particular to investigate factors (behavioral, genetic and microbial) leading to the early development of dental caries.

"Longitudinal Study of Dental Caries in VLBW Infants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This longitudinal study addresses the relationship between birth weight and early childhood caries (ECC) in a cohort of pre-term very low birth weight (VLBW) and full-term normal birth weight (NBW) infants. VLBW and ECC disproportionately affects poor and minority children costing Medicaid billions of dollars annually for treatment. The improved survival of VLBW children has resulted in greater long-term disabilities and need for health services, thus classifying them as children with special health care needs. The oral health needs of VLBW children have not been adequately studied. VLBW children are known to have a high prevalence of enamel defects in the primary dentition, which in turn can lead to increased susceptibility to ECC. Socio- behavioral factors that can predispose some children to ECC are unknown in VLBW children. Therefore the primary aims of the study are to (1) assess the incidence of ECC in VLBW and NBW infants; (2) assess mediators such as the incidence of developmental enamel defects, S.mutans infection and the extent of oral health behaviors in VLBW and NEW infants; (3) assess the indirect relationship between birth weight and ECC via mediators after controlling for independent moderating variables. A total of 200 VLBW and 200 NBW infants will be followed at 8 and 18-20 months corrected age. The proposed study will collect data on caries (decayed and filled surfaces), mediating biological variables (enamel hypoplasia and opacity, S.mutans levels) and infant oral health behavior (feeding, diet, oral hygiene practices, and dental access), and independent variables (demographics, parent predisposing, enabling, need characteristics, dental behavior, biological and child medical factors). Data analysis for testing aims 1 and 2 includes the generalized estimating equations (GEE) models, and a two-stage structural equations model (SEM) for testing the role of mediators in aim 3. The sample size provide 85 to 99% power to compare the two groups in terms of the three study aims. The results of this study will provide critical data to address the knowledge gaps in taking care of VLBW children. The clinical implications include primary prevention, early diagnosis and treatment to prevent further susceptibility to dental decay. It is also of public health interest since interventions to target knowledge, attitude, beliefs, and oral health practices can be implemented in programs for special needs children, and there by improve both oral and systemic health.

"Distribution correlation of P. gingivalis and S. cristatus in dental plaque     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Adult periodontitis is disproportionally distributed among races, and has a significantly higher incidence in non- Hispanic blacks compared to non-Hispanic whites, even when co-variates such as diabetes and other health and social factors have been taken into account. Titers to the oral pathogen P. gingivalis are reported to be higher, as anticipated, in dentate subjects with, compared to those without periodontitis. Our laboratory was to first to report an intergeneric communication between Streptococcus cristatus and P. gingivalis. We identified a surface protein of S. cristatus, arginine deiminase (ArcA), as a signal molecule to which P. gingivalis responds by repressing the expression of the fimA gene, which codes for the major subunit protein of long fimbriae. The latter is required for bacterial colonization of P. gingivalis and host cell invasion. Therefore this project will test the hypothess that: a) S. cristatus serves as a beneficial bacterium and plays an important role in the prevention of P. gingivalis colonization of the oral cavity; and b) that the increased incidence of periodontitis in African-Americans may be due to either a decreased ratio of oral S. cristatus: P. gingivalis in these subjects compared to whites, or that the FimA genotypes may differ in blacks vs. whites. Our aims therefore are to: 1) determine the distribution of S. cristatus and P. gingivalis in dental plaques of those with moderate periodontitis, severe periodontitis and periodontal healthy individuals, and compare microbial profiles (especially S. cristatus and P. gingivalis), in Africa Americans versus Caucasians within each group; and 2) to examine the correlation of these prevalence of S. cristatus and P. gingivalis with different FimA genotypes. To achieve these aims, we will recruit three groups of subjects: those with a healthy periodontium, or with moderate versus severe periodontitis. Each group will be composed of adult African American and Caucasian males and females. Exclusion criteria will include diabetes, HIV-AIDs and other health criteria such as pregnancy. All subjects will receive a full-mouth examination of periodontal status and a medical history. Microbial samples from dental plaque will be collected. The prevalence of S. cristatus and P. gingivalis will be determined by qPCR analysis, as will the prevalence of different FimA genotypes. We anticipate that the proposed studies will provide important information regarding the pathogenesis of periodontitis, and the microbial biofilms found in these two populations and will pave the way for extended studies in future, focused in the longer term on the development of appropriate interventional strategies targeting at eliminating of P. gingivalis colonization.           Porphyromonas gingivalis is a primary pathogen associated with adult periodontitis affecting a large proportion of the population, and African Americans are more likely to exhibit periodontitis than whites with odds ratio between 2.09 and 2.4 in US adults. The goal of this proposal is to investigate microbial profiles of moderate periodontitis, severe periodontitis and periodontal health individuals in African Americans and Caucasians.

"Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early childhood caries (ECC) is the most prevalent chronic childhood disease in the U.S., particularly among economically disadvantaged, underserved children. We propose to continue our existing Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health (U54DE014251) and its efforts to understand, prevent, and reduce oral health disparities, with a focus on preventing ECC. The themes of our collaborative, community-based program are (1) to provide the high-quality evidence base for new methods to prevent ECC in populations experiencing oral-health disparities and (2) to identify the most effective dissemination methods for delivering fluoride varnish (FV), an efficacious preventive method. We will actively engage California communities and providers in two large-scale intervention studies utilizing randomized clinical trial (RCT) methodology, stratified by settings, to assess the effectiveness or clinical efficacy of different preventive methods on caries incidence and increment among low-income children. Using the RE-AIM framework, Project 1 will identify the most effective setting (medical, social service agency or dental) to disseminate FV to the greatest number of 1-3-year-old children. Stratifying on setting, a parallel groups practical RCT will be conducted in 24 community-based primary care clinics (CPCCs) from the UCSF primary care collaborative research network, and 24 California Special Supplemental Nutrition Programs for Women, Infants and Children (WICs). Each non-dental site (CPCC or WIC) will be randomized to a program of parental counseling and onsite FV application or to parental counseling and referral to a dentist for child's FV application. We will also compare two automated telephone counseling methods and utilize teledentistry approaches for blinded caries assessments. Project 2 is an intervention study to be conducted in dental and non-dental settings, both affiliated with Federally Qualified Health Centers near the US-Mexico border, to compare the relative caries prevention efficacy of four protocols in 3-6 year-old children: 1) parental oral-health counseling (C) alone; 2) C+ FV; 3) C+ fluoride-releasing, glass ionomer (Gl) sealants applied to primary molars, and 4) C+FV+ Gl. Our Administrative Core, Statistics and Data Coordinating Center, and Community Liaison Program will support our two RCTs and developmental projects. These endeavors, with other education and career development activities, will foster new investigators to increase oral-health-disparity research capacity.

"University of Guam/Cancer Research Center of Hawaii Partnership (2 of 2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Oral cancer is the sixth leading cancer in the world, and ranks in the top three cancers in countries where betel nut (also known as areca nut) chewing is common. In Micronesia, a group of Pacific Islands where betel nut is frequently chewed, the risk of oral cancer is elevated, but quite variable across populations. For the period 1985-1998 (age-adjusted to the 1988 U.S. population), the prevalence per 100,000 ranged from 4.2 in Chuuk to 31.8 in Yap. In Guam, the incidence of mouth cancer per 100,000 population for the period 1997-2003, age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. population, varied between 8.1 for Chamorros to 17.9 among other Micronesians. The disparity in oral cancer rates among these populations may be due to differences in betel nut chewing patterns. To investigate the effect of chewing patterns, we must be able to conduct studies on multiple Micronesian islands with differing chewing patterns. Previously, we developed a comprehensive betel nut assessment protocol and a protocol for detecting oral lesions on Guam. The overall objectives of the pilot study are to further develop and test these methods, and to demonstrate that they can be applied in a research study of betel nut use on an island other than Guam. A convenience sample of 100 Micronesians (50 men and 50 women) who are long-term betel nut users (regular use for at least 10 years) will be recruited from the island of Saipan in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). We will collect data on betel nut use, presence of oral precancerous lesions, diet, demographics, anthropometry, medical history, and physical activity. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) collect information on betel nut use among study participants and other members of their families, 2) perform oral examinations, and biopsies, as needed, on study participants, 3) measure other health risks among this population, including obesity, high blood pressure, self-reported history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and unhealthy dietary practices and 4) examine associations of duration, frequency, and type of betel nut use with oral pre-cancers and with other health risks. This pilot project will help formulate the research methods for studying betel nut use and disease risk in Micronesia, and will provide the necessary preliminary data for a full multi-island study of betel nut use and the prevalence of oral lesions. Ultimately, a better understanding of these associations will provide important new directions for reduction of health risks through educational efforts and targeted intervention strategies.              ",University of Guam/Cancer Research Center of Hawaii Partnership (2 of 2),8548250,U54CA143728,"['Age ', ' Anthropometry ', ' Areca ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Biopsy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Grant ', ' Guam ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Island ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' chews ', ' chewed ', ' Chewing ', ' Mastication ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Micronesia ', ' Nuts ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Pacific Islands ', ' Peer Review ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' mouth lesion ', ' oral lesion ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' Area ', ' Physical activity ', ' Lesion ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Medical History ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Northern Mariana Islands ', ' Oral Examination ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Oral ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Training and Education ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' dietary pattern ', ' Dietary Practices ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Premalignant ', ' Research Training ', ' CRCH ', ' Cancer Research Center of Hawaii ', ' Process ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' demographics ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF GUAM,U54,2013,1887961,0.2111930028514738
"Center for the Biologic Basis of Oral/Systemic Disease (CBBOSD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The link between chronic oral infections and general health has been recognized since the early 20th century. During the last 2 decades, retrospective epidemiological studies and prospective longitudinal, as well as intervention, studies have supported that these chronic oral infections with accompanying chronic inflammation associate with various systemic diseases and their sequelae. This continuation application for the Center for the Biologic Basis of Oral/System Diseases (CBBO/SD) addresses major initiatives of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) regarding improving oral and general health ofthe U.S. population. The CBBO/SD is organized into 3 cInical projects: Project 1: Chronic Inflammation at the Oral and Cervico/Vaginal Mucosa; Project 2: Physiology of the Stress Response in Patients with Temporomandibular Disorders and Fibromyalgia; Project 3: Coordinated Oral-Intestinal Immune Response in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; and 2 translational science projects: Project 4: Ontogeny of Innate Immune Responses at Mucosal Surfaces; and Project 5: Gene Therapy for Orofacial Pain. These projects enlist junior investigators from the Colleges of Dentistry, Nursing, and Medicine, as well as senior mentors/co-investigators from multiple colleges at UK. The thematic interface of the projects focuses on the contribution of chronic inflammation to oral and systemic diseases. They engage populations of expectant women, patients with chronic orofacial pain, and inflammatory bowel disease. These clinical projects interact with the translational projects at the level of a common understanding of innate immune responses and inflammation, and novel therapeutic intervention strategies forthe chronic orofacial pain. The CBBO/SD provides an infrastructure for development of the junior faculty by providing grants management support, educational opportunities, a biostatistics/bioinformatics core, and a clinical research center. The continuation of the CBBO/SD is supported by the success during the initial tenure of the center in transitioning junior investigators towards independent funding, coupled with substantial investment from the university and individual colleges.

"Influence of Community Networks on Oral Health/Behaviors among Hispanics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos in the USA often suffer poor oral health. Their dental insurance coverage is the lowest of any minority, and their dental culture is often associated with behaviors that merely react to pain and acute conditions. Studies of oral health among Latinos have hitherto been limited to characterization of a few socio- economic and socio-cultural variables at the individual level. In this R21 application we propose a novel, exploratory study of a well-bounded community network of people of Mexican descent. Our short term objective is to explore the utility of applying network science research methods to improve our understanding of oral health behaviors. Our specific aims are to 1) describe the nature and distribution of social network ties, oral health risk and protective behaviors, and use of dental care within one existing community network of people of Mexican descent in the USA; and 2) examine the extent and nature of social network influence on the oral health risk and protective behavior, and the utilization of dental care of individuals within this community. Such basic structure will allow (in future projects) to contrast and refine the model with data relevant to other regions in the USA or Mexico, other Hispanic groups, other minorities, and/or generate new models. Having clearer knowledge about the factors contributing to better health behaviors will provide a foundation to craft better informed public policy, up-to-date clinical guidelines, culturally sensitive clinical and preventive care, and future research directions. Of particular interest would be to attain a superior understanding of the network structures and ties that may present key entry points to modify the relationships between actors in the community - with emphasis placed among those hubs that would be more influential to effectively disseminate actionable, accurate, and significant health and health care information.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanic dental insurance coverage is the lowest of any minority in the USA, and their dental culture is often associated with behaviors that merely react to pain and acute conditions. There is a need to understand how such behaviors are modulated beyond individual characteristics, by looking into layers of decisions made at the group and community levels. We aim to assemble social networks models to support crafting better informed public policy, up-to-date clinical guidelines, and culturally sensitive clinical and preventive care.            ",Influence of Community Networks on Oral Health/Behaviors among Hispanics,8525388,R21DE022096,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Americas ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Belief ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Acute Nasopharyngitis ', ' Common Cold ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Decision Making ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Food ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gingivitis ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Influentials ', ' dental health insurance ', ' Periodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontia insurance ', ' Oral Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Insurance ', ' Language ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Mexico ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' Persons ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Patients ', ' Chronic Periodontitis ', ' Periodontitis ', ' Public Policy ', ' Religious Belief ', ' Science ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' sound ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Clinical ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Dental ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Community Networks ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' cultural values ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' Preventive screening ', ' feeding ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' protective behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' two year old ', ' age 2 years ', ' 2 year old ', ' illness perceptions ', ' network models ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIDCR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R21,2013,187200,0.20995643099069144
"Caregiver Illness Perception and Childs Early Childhood Caries Status     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tooth decay in 2 to 11 year olds is increasing and dental utilization is lower nationally especially among poor and minority populations, while untreated primary tooth decay has remained steady. With these statistics, it is unlikely that Healthy People 2020 goals will be met. The Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM) was developed to understand individual's perception of chronic illness and for effective self-management of disease (Leventhal et al. 1997). The CSM concept has been applied to medical conditions. Except for the applicant's sponsor, the CSM framework and the questionnaire assessing CSM concepts (Illness Perception Questionnaire revised for dental: IPQ-RD) have not yet been investigated for children's or parent's perceptions of their dental problems. Building on the work of my sponsor, the overall goal of my proposed F32 research is to utilize the CSM and the behavioral model of health services use (Andersen 1968) to determine how predisposing and enabling factors, and need influence parents' illness perception of their child's dental caries (tooth decay). The objectives of this research training fellowship are: (1) A matched case control study design will compare if parent/caregivers of young children (< 6 years) who have severe early childhood caries (cases: S-ECC) versus those of parent/caregivers of children without early childhood caries (controls) are different in IPQ-RD scores; (2) A path model will investigate the effect of parent/caregiver predisposing (socio- demographic, oral health behavior, knowledge, attitude, beliefs, psychosocial factors, dental fear), enabling (dental insurance, access, personal dentist, perception of dental system), need (routine/preventive vs. problematic care) related factors on IPQ-RD, which in turn affects the likelihood of being in the case or control group. The sample size of 120 (60 case caregivers and 60 control caregivers) will be recruited from a hospital based dental clinic setting. Data collectin will involve abstraction of decayed, missing, filled primary teeth from clinic charts to determine case and control status, and two self-administered questionnaires (IPQ-RD and caregiver questionnaire). The parent/caregiver will provide consent and complete questionnaires at the time of child's routine care dental visit (controls) and at the time of restorative treatment under general anesthesia in OR (case). Data analysis will include descriptive statistics, conditional logistic regression, and structural equations [PATH] modeling approach. This research responds to NIDCR's 2009-2013 Strategic Plan I-2 ""Increase the Institute's commitment to basic and applied research in the behavioral and social sciences""; II-2 ""Emphasize the training and career development investment of individuals""; II-3 ""Welcome new disciplines poised to expand oral, dental, and craniofacial research""; IV-1 ""Identify the full range of factors that contribute to ora health inequalities"". .         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed fellowship research study will assess the illness perception of parent/caregivers of children with severe tooth decay compared to children without tooth decay. This research will build on limited work in this area of understanding the perception of parent/caregivers towards their child's tooth decay. The findings will be useful to identify factors that contribute to poor perception regarding childhood tooth decay.            ",Caregiver Illness Perception and Childs Early Childhood Caries

"Detection of HPV infection in the oral cavity of Hispanics with and without periodontal disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rising rates of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers in the United States (US) and worldwide are a significant public health concern. In the US, it is estimated that 47% (~65 million) of adults aged e30 years have periodontal disease. This is of concern as studies suggest that chronic periodontitis is associated with systemic health conditions, including oral cancers. Research evaluating the role of local oral factors on natural history of oral HPV is lacking, critical information to develop effective prevention strategies. Given the scarcity of research evaluating the role of chronic oral inflammation on the natural history of oral HPV infection, assessment of the prevalence, genotypes, and correlates of oral HPV infection in the general population is a step toward a better understanding of the burden of this infection and its potential role with oral malignancies. The present cross-sectional study will capitalize on the already established infrastructure of the Study of Overweight Adults Longitudinal Study (SOALS), an ongoing NIH-funded cohort of 1,214 Hispanic adults aged 40-65 years living in the San Juan metropolitan area of Puerto Rico, to design and implement a cross-sectional study to start addressing the gaps described. Specifically, we propose to select a random subsample of 600 non-institutionalized adults who participate in SOALS to assess the prevalence and type distribution of oral HPV infection (overall, high-risk and concurrent multiple-type) in adults with and without periodontal disease, and to assess the association between HPV infection and periodontal disease severity. For the current study, assessment of both periodontal disease and oral HPV testing will be performed using validated NHANES methodology. Measures of risk factors for oral HPV infection will be collected using the audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) methodology, a useful tool for collecting sensitive risk behavioral data. Data on dental assessment, selected sociodemographic characteristics, body mass index, lifestyles, medical and dental histories, and biochemical testing will be obtained from the parent study. For HPV typing, PCR products will be typed by dot-blot hybridization using 38 type-specific probes and two separate mixtures, including oncogenic and non-oncogenic HPV types. To our knowledge, this is the first study that will assess the frequency of oral HPV infection in Hispanic adults with and without periodontal disease. The selected study population will provide us with a unique high-risk group where both periodontal disease and oral HPV infection would be higher. Hence, we can study this association with high efficiency and at a reasonable cost. If longitudinal studies in cancer-free individuals confirm that periodontal disease increases the risk of oral HPV infection, preventive public health strategies could be developed, as periodontal disease screening could identify individuals at increased risk of oral HPV infection and oral cancer, particularly among minority, low-income, and underserved populations where oral health disparities are prevalent.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Puerto Ricans are among the fastest segments of the US Hispanic population, an ethnic group characterized by having high rates of periodontal disease, HPV infection and oral cancer. Even though studies suggest a biological plausibility for the association between periodontal disease and oral HPV infection (e.g. periodontal pockets may serve as reservoir for latent HPV), studies are still inconsistent and limited in sample size and racial diversity. The identification of factors that contribute to oral HPV infection, including th potential role of periodontitis, may provide key information for the development of preventive public health strategies, as periodontal disease screening could identify individuals at increased risk of oral HPV infection and oral cancer, particularly among minority, low-income, and underserved populations where oral health disparities are prevalent.                ",Detection of HPV infection in the oral cavity of Hispanics with and without periodontal disease,8823312,R21DE024850,"['adulthood ', '

"Multi-Center Assessment of Health Literacy and Oral Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Healthcare is becoming more complicated and demanding each year. Futuristic technologies, genetic engineering, highly specific drugs, complex insurance plans, and confusing and often conflicting messages from the media all add to the problem. Knowing how to access, understand, and use information about healthcare (i.e., health literacy) is becoming more of a challenge for everyone. According to the Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health in America, profound and consequential oral health disparities exist in the United States today. Epidemiological assessments reveal that low-income and minority populations have the highest incidence and prevalence of oral diseases and disorders. Given that these groups are also most likely to have limited health literacy skills means that they are especially vulnerable to the complications of the healthcare system and most in need of assistance. In order for effective interventions to be developed and implemented, however, a clearer understanding of the associations between limited health literacy and oral health need to be gained. At the heart of that understanding is knowing the ways that different health literacy skills (e.g., reading comprehension, numeracy, conceptual knowledge) work individually and as a group to support oral healthcare decision making and, ultimately, oral health outcomes. These findings would improve oral health and general well-being, and reduce disparities for millions in the nation. The proposed research project brings an experienced multidisciplinary team together from Baltimore, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Washington, DC to comprehensively study these associations between health literacy and oral health. A cross-section of dental patients presenting to three dental clinics in Maryland and California will be recruited and a series of assessments will be administered during face-to-face encounters. These data will also be linked to clinical records so that retrospective and prospective use of dental care services, including expenditures and utilization, may be concurrently assessed. The specific aims of the project include: 1) determining the structural relations between health literacy, oral healthcare decision making, and oral health status; 2) determining the extent to which four different measures of health literacy represent unique skills; and 3) determining the extent to which four different measures of health literacy are associated with oral health, independent of selected sociodemographic and healthcare-related covariates. The proposed project is significant because it represents the first to comprehensively study the associations between health literacy and oral health. It is also significant because it will serve as a guide for comprehensive assessments of health literacy and other health outcomes, outside of dentistry. The project is innovative because it combines multiple measures of health literacy, healthcare decision-making, and oral health outcomes into a single investigation. It is also innovative because it incorporates powerful and contemporary statistical analyses that will reveal the relative contribution of each variable to the overall model, while controlling for the aforementioned covariates.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful completion of the proposed project will result in a comprehensive understanding of the extent to which health literacy is associated with oral health. Gaining this understanding will lead to interventions aimed at improving oral health and reducing oral health disparities, benefitting millions of low-income and minority Americans. In addition, the proposed project will serve as a model for comprehensive studies of the links between health literacy and other health outcomes, beyond dentistry. This more global approach will greatly expand the field of health literacy and increase the likelihood of successful interventions in medicine.

"Good Oral Health: a Bi-level Intervention to Improve Older Adult Oral Health     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application will extend a successful NIDCR-funded bi-level oral health self-management pilot conducted among older/disabled adults residing in one older adult residential building to six buildings and evaluate it using a modified fractional factorial design. The theoretical framework is based on Fishbein's modified theory of reasoned action called the Integrated Model (IM) of Behavioral Prediction. It is operationalized through Adapted Motivational Interviewing, an interactive tailored cognitive approach, and Practice-to-Mastery (AMI-PM). The intervention includes two components: 1) a face to face administration of the AMI-PM; and 2) a targeted building-level campaign that includes principles of practice to master (CA-PM). The specific aims are to: 1) Test the two main components of a bi-level intervention to improve clinical oral hygiene outcomes in relation to one another, and through differential sequencing. 2) Identify cognitive and behavioral mechanisms contributing to clinical oral hygiene outcomes. 3) Assess impact and sustainability of behavioral and clinical outcomes over time. The intervention will be carried out in three cycles of 150 participants each for a total of N=450. Each cycle will include two buildings matched by size and ethnic/linguistic composition housing older adults and those with disabilities. In one condition, the individual leve intervention will be introduced followed by the group level intervention. In the second condition, the group level intervention will precede the individual level. Survey and clinical measures taken at baseline, and following the administration of the first and second components. This design will enable comparison of the short term efficacy of the individual versus group level component (T1 - T2) and the shorter and longer term efficacy of the interventions (T3 - 3 months). Clinical measures at T4, 6 months later, will evaluate sustainability of effect. Primary outcome measures are gingival index and plaque score, both of which improved significantly in the pilot study. Significance lies in the potential of the intervention to address critical disparities in oral healh through oral health promotion initiatives in the locations where they reside as well as the ability to evaluate the intervention efficiently using a design alternative to the RCT.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study's primary significance lies in the potential of this bi-level intervention to address significant disparities in oral health and consequent morbidity or reduced quality of life among vulnerable, low-income and primarily minority older adults and those with disabilities through prevention in the locations where they reside. The intervention could provide a model for programs to reduce oral health disparities across Connecticut and nationally.                 ",Good Oral Health: a Bi-level Intervention to Improve Older Adult Oral Health,8671091,U01DE024168,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Attitude ', ' Belief ', ' Communities ', ' Connecticut ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Gingival Indexes ', ' Grant ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Housing ', ' Hygiene ', ' indexing ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Dental Schools ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Self Management ', ' Advocacy ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Oral ', ' Location ', ' behavioral prediction ', ' behavior prediction ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Cognitive ', ' Behavioral ', ' health related quality of life ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' comparative ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,U01,2014,852371,0.19338890675542
"Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early childhood caries (ECC) is the most prevalent chronic childhood disease in the U.S., particularly among economically disadvantaged, underserved children. We propose to continue our existing Center to Address Disparities in Children's Oral Health (U54DE014251) and its efforts to understand, prevent, and reduce oral health disparities, with a focus on preventing ECC. The themes of our collaborative, community-based program are (1) to provide the high-quality evidence base for new methods to prevent ECC in populations experiencing oral-health disparities and (2) to identify the most effective dissemination methods for delivering fluoride varnish (FV), an efficacious preventive method. We will actively engage California communities and providers in two large-scale intervention studies utilizing randomized clinical trial (RCT) methodology, stratified by settings, to assess the effectiveness or clinical efficacy of different preventive methods on caries incidence and increment among low-income children. Using the RE-AIM framework, Project 1 will identify the most effective setting (medical, social service agency or dental) to disseminate FV to the greatest number of 1-3-year-old children. Stratifying on setting, a parallel groups practical RCT will be conducted in 24 community-based primary care clinics (CPCCs) from the UCSF primary care collaborative research network, and 24 California Special Supplemental Nutrition Programs for Women, Infants and Children (WICs). Each non-dental site (CPCC or WIC) will be randomized to a program of parental counseling and onsite FV application or to parental counseling and referral to a dentist for child's FV application. We will also compare two automated telephone counseling methods and utilize teledentistry approaches for blinded caries assessments. Project 2 is an intervention study to be conducted in dental and non-dental settings, both affiliated with Federally Qualified Health Centers near the US-Mexico border, to compare the relative caries prevention efficacy of four protocols in 3-6 year-old children: 1) parental oral-health counseling (C) alone; 2) C+ FV; 3) C+ fluoride-releasing, glass ionomer (Gl) sealants applied to primary molars, and 4) C+FV+ Gl. Our Administrative Core, Statistics and Data Coordinating Center, and Community Liaison Program will support our two RCTs and developmental projects. These endeavors, with other education and career development activities, will foster new investigators to increase oral-health-disparity research capacity.

"Center for the Biologic Basis of Oral/Systemic Diseases (Phase III)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Systemic Diseases (CBBO/SD)"" is to continue sustainability of a nationally competitive transdisciplinary research center focusing on oral healt sciences and systemic diseases within the University of Kentucky. This proposal builds upon the Phase l/ll funding for developing the research infrastructure in the College of Dentistry and supporting junior investigators to develop competitive research programs using this infrastructure. The CBBO/SD represents the concrete realization of the Specific Aims of the Phase l/ll funding that was designed to: (i) expand the critical mass of funded investigators at UK in the areas of oral and systemic health research; (ii) create and enhance cutting-edge scientific core resources that can continue to serve as platforms to increase the competitiveness of existing research faculty, as well as for recruiting new faculty; and (iii) implement the range f infrastructure improvements in the research enterprise to successfully transition the COBRE funding into long-term competitive, renewable support from a diverse array of federal and non-federal sources. The UKCD created a position for an Associate Dean for Research, and a Center for Oral Health Research (COHR) housed in the college to develop and oversee a broad range of basic and applied research beginning in 2000. This was followed by events that created a vibrant environment for implementation of the CBBO/SD in 2003 with an explicit goal of developing a center conducting research on oral and systemic health and housed in the College of Dentistry. The CBBO/SD provides a strong thematic research focus and unique resources, along with research training of graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty mentoring. From the outset this was accomplished in a collaborative framework that emphasized mentoring, scientific advancement, academic career development, competitive grantsmanship, and productivity. The Phase III proposal incorporates 4 interactive cores: Adminstrative/Educational Core, Delta Dental of Kentucky Clinical Research Center (DDKCRC) Core; Core Translational Diagnostics Laboratory (CTDL); and Oral Health Pilot Program (OI-IPP) core. The CBBO/SD Phase Ill objectives are to: (1) focus efforts and resources towards creating a sustainable university-wide research center with unique clinical and translational scientific cores providing interdisciplinary research interactions in oral and general health investigations, (2) continue to identify, Stimulate and nurture investigators at the University of Kentucky to ascertain and pursue important questions related to diseases of the oral and craniofacial complex, and (3) enhance the expansion of collaborative research programs by supplying structure and expertise in specialized core facilities supporting these research initiatives. The major research theme of the CBBO/SD generally remains similar to those throughout the Phase l/ll tenure of the center. This focused on chronic inflammatory diseases with infections and dysregulated host responses linking oral and systemic health. The CBBO/SD has a parallel goal in providing the fundamental basis for the research enterprise in the UK College of Dentistry (UKCD) to actively participate in the national clinical and translation research environment with a focus of moving clinical findings into improving health of the population with enhanced implementation of new clinical findings. As the flagship land-grant University of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the UKCD has a major role in helping to solve the massive health care needs of the Appalachian population inhabiting 54 counties in Kentucky by addressing multigenerational oral and general health disparities in Appalachian Kentucky. This will require effective interprofessional education, collaborative research initiatives, and emphasizing external funding from a wide array of NIH institutes, other federal agencies, and independent private and public funding sources. The Strategic Objectives of the Phase III aspect of the center include: understand the molecular mechanisms underlying periodontal disease; foster collaborations enabling definition of the biologic mechanisms linking periodontal disease with systemic disease(s); support collaborative efforts across the UK campus to engage additional research teams into the offering of the Genetics/Genomics services and the Mineralized Tissue services; and, continue the research relationship with the Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences at UK to implement community-based initiatives to reduce oral disease burden.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The COBRE core infrastructure will focus on supporting clinical and translational research that impacts health of the oral cavity and the individual.

"Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health will focus on oral health concerns of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) and will be known as the Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR). The Principal Investigator is Judith E. N. Albino, PhD, President Emeritus of the University of Colorado and Professor, American Indian/Alaska Native Programs (AIANP) and Craniofacial Biology, and a health psychologist. She will lead the Research Program Administrative Center (RPAC). Dr. Spero Manson, PhD, Professor and Head, AIANP, and a medical anthropologist, will serve as Co-Investigator and lead the Community Liaison and Dissemination Core within RPAC. Biostatistician William Henderson, PhD, Professor, Colorado Health Outcomes Program, will lead the Statistics and Data Coordinating Center (S&DCC). CNOHR takes a comprehensive approach to oral health disparities in the long term, with an initial focus on oral infections and key roles of behavioral factors and comorbidities. The interdisciplinary team includes scientists trained in anthropology, biostatistics, dentistry, economics, medicine, psychology, and public health, supported by experienced project management and technology teams. The three initial projects focus on caries and periodontal disease, and intervene by extending current services and their use as well as adding prevention services and oral health promotion. The first Research Component (RC1) tests an intervention with pregnant women/mothers of newborns on a Northern Plains Reservation, which is focused on the use of motivational interviewing in prevention of ECC. RC2 is a randomized clinical trial of two methods for treating periodontal disease in Southwestern American Indians who also have Type 2 diabetes mellitus. RC3 is a test of a service delivery intervention in which tribal/community members are trained to apply fluoride varnish and deliver personalized oral health education for 3-5 year old children and their parents enrolled in reservation-based Indian Head Start programs. A Developmental Research Program will offer opportunities to pilot work suggested by new investigators, by community participation and planning activities, and by preliminary results of major projects. A focus on dissemination will include activities aimed at increasing community awareness and influencing health policy. Considerable prior experience with the participating tribes and communities has shaped the CNOHR methods and approaches, and ongoing community participation in planning will continue to influence the implementation of the RCs. A robust program of training and career development experiences will include mentoring and support for students at the secondary, undergraduate, professional and graduate, and post-doctoral levels, with emphasis on recruiting AI/AN investigators to oral health disparities research.

"Caregiver Illness Perception and Childs Early Childhood Caries Status     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tooth decay in 2 to 11 year olds is increasing and dental utilization is lower nationally especially among poor and minority populations, while untreated primary tooth decay has remained steady. With these statistics, it is unlikely that Healthy People 2020 goals will be met. The Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM) was developed to understand individual's perception of chronic illness and for effective self-management of disease (Leventhal et al. 1997). The CSM concept has been applied to medical conditions. Except for the applicant's sponsor, the CSM framework and the questionnaire assessing CSM concepts (Illness Perception Questionnaire revised for dental: IPQ-RD) have not yet been investigated for children's or parent's perceptions of their dental problems. Building on the work of my sponsor, the overall goal of my proposed F32 research is to utilize the CSM and the behavioral model of health services use (Andersen 1968) to determine how predisposing and enabling factors, and need influence parents' illness perception of their child's dental caries (tooth decay). The objectives of this research training fellowship are: (1) A matched case control study design will compare if parent/caregivers of young children (< 6 years) who have severe early childhood caries (cases: S-ECC) versus those of parent/caregivers of children without early childhood caries (controls) are different in IPQ-RD scores; (2) A path model will investigate the effect of parent/caregiver predisposing (socio- demographic, oral health behavior, knowledge, attitude, beliefs, psychosocial factors, dental fear), enabling (dental insurance, access, personal dentist, perception of dental system), need (routine/preventive vs. problematic care) related factors on IPQ-RD, which in turn affects the likelihood of being in the case or control group. The sample size of 120 (60 case caregivers and 60 control caregivers) will be recruited from a hospital based dental clinic setting. Data collectin will involve abstraction of decayed, missing, filled primary teeth from clinic charts to determine case and control status, and two self-administered questionnaires (IPQ-RD and caregiver questionnaire). The parent/caregiver will provide consent and complete questionnaires at the time of child's routine care dental visit (controls) and at the time of restorative treatment under general anesthesia in OR (case). Data analysis will include descriptive statistics, conditional logistic regression, and structural equations [PATH] modeling approach. This research responds to NIDCR's 2009-2013 Strategic Plan I-2 ""Increase the Institute's commitment to basic and applied research in the behavioral and social sciences""; II-2 ""Emphasize the training and career development investment of individuals""; II-3 ""Welcome new disciplines poised to expand oral, dental, and craniofacial research""; IV-1 ""Identify the full range of factors that contribute to ora health inequalities"". .         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed fellowship research study will assess the illness perception of parent/caregivers of children with severe tooth decay compared to children without tooth decay. This research will build on limited work in this area of understanding the perception of parent/caregivers towards their child's tooth decay. The findings will be useful to identify factors that contribute to poor perception regarding childhood tooth decay.            ",Caregiver Illness Perception and Childs Early Childhood Caries

"Validating OCT and Raman spectroscopy for assessment of tooth de/remineralization     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries continues to be prevalent in children and youth, with significant oral health disparities existing in some population groups. This disease arises when the balance between pathological factors (e.g. cariogenic bacteria) and protective factors (e.g. saliva flow) is tipped in favour of demineralization. The prevalence of caries suggests that the disease is not being effectively managed with an emphasis traditionally on restorative procedures where caries lesions are already serious. Dentistry is undergoing a paradigm shift away from surgical treatment of caries to a medical model of disease prevention and management. This change aims to address the disease cause with minimally invasive CAries Management By Risk Assessment (CAMBRA) efforts. For this paradigm to be successful, dentists need better tools to detect early lesions. Early detection will allow dentists to monitor and counsel patients in managing caries risk factors to help prevent disease progression. We hypothesize that the combination of morphological and biochemical information provided by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and polarized Raman spectroscopy (PRS), respectively, can provide clinicians with an improved tool to detect and assess early caries lesions as well as to be used for both short- and long-term monitoring for better caries management. The overall objective of this competitive renewal proposal is to develop a novel software and hardware clinical platform based on a combined OCT-PRS intra-oral probe for early dental caries detection and assessment. To achieve this goal we plan to: 1) establish a clinic-friendly software platform to derive caries relevant parameters from the OCT-PRS data, 2) develop combined OCT-PRS caries assessment intra-oral probes for proximal and occlusal surfaces, and finally 3) validate the hardware and software for clinical utility in caries detectio and assessment through two small scale clinical studies. Our research will provide novel automated software algorithms to provide clinicians with measures of caries presence, lesion extent, quantitative assessment of caries lesion activity and mineralization status during the examination of the patient. The proposed developments and evidence-based findings will support a paradigm shift in treating caries as a disease. This research supports the new US Healthy People 2020 program in which an oral health objective is to reduce caries and untreated decay among children and adolescents.          Dental decay (dental caries) is preventable and curable, yet it is among the most common chronic diseases affecting children in the USA with significant oral health disparities existing in some population groups. The proposed research will provide clinicians with improved tools to detect and assess early dental caries for better caries management.

"Dental Sealant Placements on Children's Teeth: Assessing Medicaid Policy Change     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries is a chronic condition and the most common preventable dental disease affecting children's oral health-related quality of life and well-being. Adequate access to preventive dental procedures remains a challenge for Medicaid-enrolled children. Placement of dental sealants is an evidence-based preventive procedure where a thin plastic coating is bonded into the deep grooves, pits and fissure surfaces of premolar and molar teeth to prevent dental caries (tooth decay). Despite documented evidence of the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and benefits of dental sealant placement, they still remain underutilized. In 2006, the Wisconsin Medicaid program changed its policy to allow dental hygienists in school based settings, to become Medicaid certified providers for dental sealant placement. It is unclear whether this policy change has resulted in an appreciable increase in access and utilization of dental sealants as well as reduced restorative care on first molars for Medicaid- enrolled children in Wisconsin. The goal of this project is to assess whether this policy change in a public health program and system has influenced access, oral health disparities and rates of dental sealant utilization in children considered to be at high risk for dental caries. Ths study will use Medicaid claims data for 2004 to 2013 from the Electronic Data Systems of Medicaid Evaluation and Decision Support (MEDS) database for the state of Wisconsin. Using the Wisconsin Medicaid Claims data we will: 1) assess the overall utilization rates of dental sealant placement among Medicaid- enrolled children pre- and post-policy period; 2) examine the association of patients' socio- demographics, provider characteristics, designation of Dental Health Professional Area (DHPSA) and county level characteristics using Urban Influence Codes on the utilization of dental sealants; and 3) test the association between sealants placed on first molars and restorative treatment for first molars over time. Descriptive statistics and multivariate regression models will be used to estimate the effect of the policy change on the rate at which Medicaid-eligible children receive dental sealants and restorative treatment on first molars. We will control for all available covariates including child's county of residence, age and year. The study will document relevant variables associated with the policy change and the effect on public health service systems and the benefit of collaborative practice of health professionals aimed at eliminating health disparities. This secondary data analysis project is innovative, addresses oral health care disparities and provides documentation that is supportive of community-grounded efforts aimed at improving oral health. Findings from this project may influence future expansion of the policy to other states yet to adopt it, increase awareness about the benefits of sealants as a preventive measure and promote public health program development.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will provide documentation regarding the influence of policy change as a driving force for improving access to care, reducing oral health disparities and increasing the utilization of preventive dental services. In addition, it provides information that could have an impact on transforming health improvement efforts through capacity building in public health programs and systems.                 ",Dental Sealant Placements on Children's Teeth: Assessing Medicaid Policy Change,8750565,R03DE024494,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' Premolar Tooth ', ' Premolar ', ' Bicuspid Tooth ', ' Bicuspid ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dental Hygienists ', ' Dentistry ', ' Dentists ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Medicaid ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' molar (dental) ', ' Molar tooth ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Dental Sealants ', ' Pit and Fissure Sealants ', ' Plastics ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' sound ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' dental disorder ', ' dental disease ', ' Tooth Disorder ', ' Tooth Diseases ', ' United States ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' Wisconsin ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Dental ', ' residence ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' tooth surface ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' treatment program ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Documentation ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Improve Access ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Update ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' electronic data ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' working group ', ' systematic review ', ' restorative treatment ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' driving force ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIDCR,MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY,R03,2014,163644,0.18792038760983923
"University of Guam/Cancer Research Center of Hawaii Partnership (1 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Oral cancer is the sixth leading cancer in the world, and ranks in the top three cancers in countries where betel nut (also known as areca nut) chewing is common. In Micronesia, a group of Pacific Islands where betel nut is frequently chewed, the risk of oral cancer is elevated, but quite variable across populations. For the period 1985-1998 (age-adjusted to the 1988 U.S. population), the prevalence per 100,000 ranged from 4.2 in Chuuk to 31.8 in Yap. In Guam, the incidence of mouth cancer per 100,000 population for the period 1997-2003, age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. population, varied between 8.1 for Chamorros to 17.9 among other Micronesians. The disparity in oral cancer rates among these populations may be due to differences in betel nut chewing patterns. To investigate the effect of chewing patterns, we must be able to conduct studies on multiple Micronesian islands with differing chewing patterns. Previously, we developed a comprehensive betel nut assessment protocol and a protocol for detecting oral lesions on Guam. The overall objectives of the pilot study are to further develop and test these methods, and to demonstrate that they can be applied in a research study of betel nut use on an island other than Guam. A convenience sample of 100 Micronesians (50 men and 50 women) who are long-term betel nut users (regular use for at least 10 years) will be recruited from the island of Saipan in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). We will collect data on betel nut use, presence of oral precancerous lesions, diet, demographics, anthropometry, medical history, and physical activity. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) collect information on betel nut use among study participants and other members of their families, 2) perform oral examinations, and biopsies, as needed, on study participants, 3) measure other health risks among this population, including obesity, high blood pressure, self-reported history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and unhealthy dietary practices and 4) examine associations of duration, frequency, and type of betel nut use with oral pre-cancers and with other health risks. This pilot project will help formulate the research methods for studying betel nut use and disease risk in Micronesia, and will provide the necessary preliminary data for a full multi-island study of betel nut use and the prevalence of oral lesions. Ultimately, a better understanding of these associations will provide important new directions for reduction of health risks through educational efforts and targeted intervention strategies.

"Predicting Caries Risk in Underserved Toddlers in Primary Healthcare Settings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dental caries, the most common chronic disease of childhood, is a largely preventable disease. This proposal focuses on addressing inequities in dental caries experience among preschool aged U.S. children. It has been inspired by the shift and increase in dental caries among subsets of the population (i.e., 2-5 year old children, especially from underserved/minority population groups) that calls for a greater focus on targeted healthcare. In an environment of increasing healthcare costs and resource constraints, this approach is paramount in addressing oral health disparities. Because children have multiple well-child pediatric visits in the early years of life, many lower socioeconomic status (SES) and minority children have much greater access to medical care than to dental care. Our long-term goal is to reduce disparities in dental caries experience in young children in the U.S. by developing effective risk-based caries preventive and therapeutic strategies to be delivered through new models for oral health care, including primary medical healthcare settings. However, the problem is that currently there is no practical, validated and easily-scored tool practitioners can use to accurately and reliably assess, and effectively triage children at the highest risk for caries. Such an urgently needed tool will be developed in this proposed research. Thus, the objective of this study is to validate a caries risk questionnaire in order to develop a practical and easily-scored caries risk tool for use in primary medical healthcare settings to identify young, diverse U.S. children (1-4 years of age) with the highest risk for the development of caries. This will be accomplished by having the parents of 1,326 infants complete a caries risk questionnaire and by performing caries examinations on the children at baseline (child's age 12 + 3 months old), and again at 18 months (child's age 30 + 3 months) and 36 months after the baseline (child's age 48 + 3 months) to monitor the caries disease process, and how well the risk tool predicts caries risk status as the child ages. A great strength of this proposal is that it involves four experienced investigator groups who offer strong partnerships between medical and dental teams, and three study sites with well established primary care medical research networks that provide access and facilitate follow up to a variety of at-risk, diverse populations, including ethnic and racial minorities and low SES groups. Each study site also has an NIH Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA), and will benefit from infrastructure and experience in longitudinal clinical translational research. The significance of this work is that identification of high caries risk children in primary healthcare settings allows cost-effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed, targeted and used in these settings to prevent early childhood caries. This will have immediate broad impact and influence on existing dental and medical policies and programs regarding screening and prevention of dental caries among young children from diverse disadvantaged and underserved subgroups, in primary medical and dental pediatric healthcare settings.          The relevance of this collaborative, innovative and high impact project between physicians and dentists is that it will result in a valid, reliable, and practical (easy to score) caries risk assessment tool for the identification of high caries risk infants/toddlers in primary medical healthcare settings allowing for cost effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed and targeted to prevent early childhood caries, and help reduce disparities in caries experience.

"Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health will focus on oral health concerns of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) and will be known as the Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR). The Principal Investigator is Judith E. N. Albino, PhD, President Emeritus of the University of Colorado and Professor, American Indian/Alaska Native Programs (AIANP) and Craniofacial Biology, and a health psychologist. She will lead the Research Program Administrative Center (RPAC). Dr. Spero Manson, PhD, Professor and Head, AIANP, and a medical anthropologist, will serve as Co-Investigator and lead the Community Liaison and Dissemination Core within RPAC. Biostatistician William Henderson, PhD, Professor, Colorado Health Outcomes Program, will lead the Statistics and Data Coordinating Center (S&DCC). CNOHR takes a comprehensive approach to oral health disparities in the long term, with an initial focus on oral infections and key roles of behavioral factors and comorbidities. The interdisciplinary team includes scientists trained in anthropology, biostatistics, dentistry, economics, medicine, psychology, and public health, supported by experienced project management and technology teams. The three initial projects focus on caries and periodontal disease, and intervene by extending current services and their use as well as adding prevention services and oral health promotion. The first Research Component (RC1) tests an intervention with pregnant women/mothers of newborns on a Northern Plains Reservation, which is focused on the use of motivational interviewing in prevention of ECC. RC2 is a randomized clinical trial of two methods for treating periodontal disease in Southwestern American Indians who also have Type 2 diabetes mellitus. RC3 is a test of a service delivery intervention in which tribal/community members are trained to apply fluoride varnish and deliver personalized oral health education for 3-5 year old children and their parents enrolled in reservation-based Indian Head Start programs. A Developmental Research Program will offer opportunities to pilot work suggested by new investigators, by community participation and planning activities, and by preliminary results of major projects. A focus on dissemination will include activities aimed at increasing community awareness and influencing health policy. Considerable prior experience with the participating tribes and communities has shaped the CNOHR methods and approaches, and ongoing community participation in planning will continue to influence the implementation of the RCs. A robust program of training and career development experiences will include mentoring and support for students at the secondary, undergraduate, professional and graduate, and post-doctoral levels, with emphasis on recruiting AI/AN investigators to oral health disparities research.     ",Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR),8662549,U54DE019259,"['American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Anthropology ', ' Awareness ', ' Biology ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dentistry ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Economics ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks) ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-6 weeks old ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Parents ', ' periodontium disorder ', ' periodontium disease ', ' periodontal disorder ', ' Parodontosis ', ' Periodontal Diseases ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' community planning ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Shapes ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' oral infectious ', ' infection mouth ', ' oral infection ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Services ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' Head Start ', ' Head Start Program ', ' prevention service ', ' member ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Prevention ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Reservations ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' reservation-based ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' tribal communities ', ' tribal community ', ' northern plains ', ' Outcome ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 year old ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,U54,2014,2388547,0.273548267273214
"Family Intervention with Caregivers of Children with Dental Needs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries (tooth decay) in 2--11 year olds is increasing especially among poor and minority populations, and it is unlikely that Healthy People 2020 goals will be met. Dental screening of children in elementary schools has been mandated in 12 states and endorsed by US organizations and WHO. In spite of enthusiasm for the concept, screening and standard referral letters have been ineffective in getting parents/caregivers to take children to the dentist. Caregiver-level engagement or action is necessary to motivate follow-up on child- level interventions at schools. Thus, we propose an experimental intervention based upon the Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM) to address parent/caregiver illness perception (cognitive representation: identity, consequences, controllability, cause, timeline; and emotional representation) and navigation of resources to increase receipt of dental care for children with restorative dental needs. The Specific Aims of the proposed multi-site double-blind Phase III randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) study are: (1) Utilizing a three arm design, to evaluate the new CSM theory-driven referral letter alone or the new CSM referral letter + Dental Information Guide (DIG: facts about dental caries, hints for getting dental care, making appointments and Medicaid access, transportation and dentists availability resources) compared to a standard referral letter to increase receipt of dental care among inner-city urban African American, and rural Hispanic and White elementary school children; (2) To assess changes in parent/caregiver illness representation/perception and behavioral intention between the beginning and end of school year to understand the underlying mechanisms of the new vs. standard referral approach resulting in receipt of dental care. There will be 2 study sites: Ohio (East Cleveland City School District); Oregon (Jefferson County School District 509-J and Morrow County School District). All K-4th grade children and caregivers will be recruited through school district events. Children will be screened at beginning of the school year to determine caregiver eligibility for participation in the RCT. A total of 660 caregivers whose children have restorative dental needs will be randomized to the 3 study arms, and intervention letters will be sent home. Data collection includes: child baseline screening and follow-up dental exam at the study exit 7 mos later to determine if the child received care; caregiver illness perception questionnaire revised for dental (IPQ-RD) and a caregiver questionnaire at 3 time points (baseline, one-month after receipt of intervention letters exit). Data analysis for aim 1 includes a multivariate logistic regression model with adjustment for baseline characteristics; and aim 2 includes a generalized causal mediation analysis to delineate the mechanism (or paths) through which interventions impact dental care receipt. This behavioral intervention has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for screening by utilizing a cost- effective, easily transportable, and sustainable approach. The RCT is a collaboration of Case Western Reserve University and University of Washington Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will test an innovative behavioral approach to the referral process never attempted before. The new intervention letter and information guide are intended to change caregiver illness perception by addressing three issues - (1) knowing the importance of caries-free baby teeth for protection of permanent teeth (2) viewing dental caries as a chronic disease rather than acute or episodic; and (3) navigation of resources for dental care access. This new referral approach also has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for school screening programs required by law in many states.                ",Family

"Addressing Oral Health Disparities in Medicaid-Enrolled Special Needs Children wi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed application for a K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award is being submitted by Donald Chi, a dentist with advanced clinical training in pediatric dentistry and dental public health. Dr. Chi is currently a PhD candidate in Oral Health Services Research at the University of Iowa. This award will allow Dr. Chi to meet his long-term goal of becoming an independently-funded clinician scholar with an interdisciplinary research program that addresses disparities in oral health and access to dental care for children with special health care needs. His immediate career goal is to extend his dissertation research on access to dental care for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition by developing, testing, and refining a new multi-level conceptual model on access. Dr. Chi proposes the following five aims related to his career development: (1) improve conceptual understanding of access to care for low-income children with special needs; (2) learn and apply new discipline- and theory-based research methods; (3) collect pilot data for a future R01 application; (4) improve writing skills and professional networks; and (5) develop mentorship skills. In addition, he will test the central hypothesis of the proposed research plan - that the health care system-, community-, provider-, family-, and child-level determinants of access to dental care are complex, interrelated, and vary in relative importance depending on type of access being examined - through the following three research aims: (1) identify the multi-level determinants of access to dental care for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition using administrative data; (2) evaluate the extent to which behavioral factors are associated with access to dental care for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition using survey data; and (3) assess the relationship between access to dental care and the level of unmet dental need for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition using clinical data. This research will guide future studies on access and help in the development of multi-level interventions that will improve the oral health of Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition. The proposed career development and research activities will take place in highly supportive, research-intensive environments. Peter Milgrom, DDS and Colleen Huebner, PhD, national experts in their respective fields and Directors of the Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities at the University of Washington School of Dentistry, will supervise Dr. Chi's research and career development activities. In addition, Dr. Chi will receive consulting advice from John Neff, MD (co-developer of Clinical Risk Grouping software); Lloyd Mancl, PhD (biostatistician); and Elizabeth Momany, PhD (Iowa Medicaid data expert). Finally, all activities will be overseen by an External Advisory Committee consisting of Jeffrey Murray, MD (Professor of Pediatrics, University of Iowa); Peter Damiano, DDS, MPH (Professor of Preventive and Community Dentistry, University of Iowa); and Diane Martin, PhD (Professor of Health Services, University of Washington). This cross-institutional, interdisciplinary mentorship team will facilitate Dr. Chi's natural progression from current research experiences to the mentored clinical scientist development phase and then to independence.      Public Health Relevance: There is a dearth of research on access to dental care for publicly-insured children with special health care needs. This project seeks to identify and understand the multi-level determinants of access to dental care for Medicaid-enrolled children with a chronic condition. Our work will be used to develop clinical and policy strategies designed to reduce oral health disparities and to improve the oral health of these vulnerable children.

"Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries is a very different disease than it was forty years ago. While caries is declining in general, caries rates in young children (ages 2-5) in the US have been increasing (US GAO, 2008). There is also increasing disparity seen with severe caries occurring disproportionately in the poor and disenfranchised. Notably, individuals living in selected areas of Appalachia have some of the worst oral health indicators in the U.S. The current proposal is a renewal of our ongoing project (R01-DE-014899) to identify factors contributing to the oral health disparity seen in northern Appalachia versus the rest of the nation. The guiding philosophy of our project has been and continues to be that developing strategies to address this disparity requires simultaneous study of multiple risk components (ideally within families) to determine their roles, interactions among them, and their transmissibility patterns. The long-term goal of our program of research is to determine why the Northern Appalachian population is at increased risk of oral disease so that targeted preventive interventions can be designed.  One of the most notable results from the first project period was that the disparity in dental caries is evident at an early age; the prevalence of total caries experience in 2 - 5 year olds from our Northern Appalachian study was 144% of the prevalence of comparable children in NHANES, with this disparity diminishing in later age groups. Importantly, we also identified genes in multiple categories (tooth structure, taste preference, and salivary proteins) that are associated with either increased caries risk or protection, sometimes showing different effects in different age groups and/or dentitions. Finally, our microbiological and genetic studies of S. mutans demonstrated extreme genetic diversity and showed that S. mutans alone is unlikely to be the sole caries risk factor; more likely, dynamic changes in the oral microbial ecology are responsible for elevated disease risk. Based on the cross-sectional results, we hypothesize that the mechanisms that lead to disparities develop within the first two years of life. Implicit in this hypothesis is the need to address these questions longitudinally among children before and during the time of greatest risk from three different perspectives:  psychosocial, genetic, and microbiological.  The aims of this renewal include development of a longitudinal study of dental caries development early in life by recruiting a cohort of pregnant women. We will then utilize both the data collected in the first project period, and new data from the longitudinal cohort to follow up the significant environmental, genetic and microbial results from the first project period.

"Parental preventive behaviors and oral health in Latino children     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tooth decay (caries) is the most common childhood disease in the United States, affecting 28% of children 2-5 years old, and costing the United States over $35 billion dollars every year. Latino children are more likely to be affected and are more likely to have severe, extensive and untreated decay. A linguistically and culturally appropriate intervention, called Contra Caries, was developed based on prior qualitative research with Latino families and Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). SCT is a health behavior theory that outlines constructs, such as behavioral capability, outcome expectations, self-efficacy, and environment that have been associated with many behaviors. However, the SCT constructs have not fully been explored for oral hygiene behaviors. The Contra Caries intervention (NIH grant # R21DE019210, Barker PI) was piloted with rural, low-income Spanish-speaking parent/caregivers of children 1-5 years old and found to be well- accepted and feasible to implement. But Contra Caries has never been evaluated for effects on behavior, nor was the Contra Caries evaluation part of the original grant application. The overall objectives of this proposal are to create new knowledge and translate that into evidence- based interventions for improved early childhood oral health. The goals of this proposal are to better understand the cognitive factors influencing parental oral health protective behaviors, such as toothbrushing, and to evaluate whether Contra Caries improved the quantity and quality of such behaviors. Using data from the Contra Caries study population, the aims of the current proposal are: Aim 1: To determine if survey questions measuring behavioral capability, outcome expectations, self-efficacy, and environment are positively associated with protective behaviors especially, but not limited to, regular tooth brushing of children's teeth. Aim 2: To determine if the Contra Caries education intervention improves quantity and quality of protective behaviors, such as toothbrushing of children's teeth. The knowledge gained from Aims 1 and 2 will provide the necessary preliminary data to inform future intervention research, such as design of a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the Contra Caries education intervention.

"Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries is a very different disease than it was forty years ago. While caries is declining in general, caries rates in young children (ages 2-5) in the US have been increasing (US GAO, 2008). There is also increasing disparity seen with severe caries occurring disproportionately in the poor and disenfranchised. Notably, individuals living in selected areas of Appalachia have some of the worst oral health indicators in the U.S. The current proposal is a renewal of our ongoing project (R01-DE-014899) to identify factors contributing to the oral health disparity seen in northern Appalachia versus the rest of the nation. The guiding philosophy of our project has been and continues to be that developing strategies to address this disparity requires simultaneous study of multiple risk components (ideally within families) to determine their roles, interactions among them, and their transmissibility patterns. The long-term goal of our program of research is to determine why the Northern Appalachian population is at increased risk of oral disease so that targeted preventive interventions can be designed.  One of the most notable results from the first project period was that the disparity in dental caries is evident at an early age; the prevalence of total caries experience in 2 - 5 year olds from our Northern Appalachian study was 144% of the prevalence of comparable children in NHANES, with this disparity diminishing in later age groups. Importantly, we also identified genes in multiple categories (tooth structure, taste preference, and salivary proteins) that are associated with either increased caries risk or protection, sometimes showing different effects in different age groups and/or dentitions. Finally, our microbiological and genetic studies of S. mutans demonstrated extreme genetic diversity and showed that S. mutans alone is unlikely to be the sole caries risk factor; more likely, dynamic changes in the oral microbial ecology are responsible for elevated disease risk. Based on the cross-sectional results, we hypothesize that the mechanisms that lead to disparities develop within the first two years of life. Implicit in this hypothesis is the need to address these questions longitudinally among children before and during the time of greatest risk from three different perspectives:  psychosocial, genetic, and microbiological.  The aims of this renewal include development of a longitudinal study of dental caries development early in life by recruiting a cohort of pregnant women. We will then utilize both the data collected in the first project period, and new data from the longitudinal cohort to follow up the significant environmental, genetic and microbial results from the first project period. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite years of study and preventive dentistry, dental caries in young children has been markedly increasing.

"Dental Sealant Placements on Children's Teeth: Assessing Medicaid Policy Change DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries is a chronic condition and the most common preventable dental disease affecting children's oral health-related quality of life and well-being. Adequate access to preventive dental procedures remains a challenge for Medicaid-enrolled children. Placement of dental sealants is an evidence-based preventive procedure where a thin plastic coating is bonded into the deep grooves, pits and fissure surfaces of premolar and molar teeth to prevent dental caries (tooth decay). Despite documented evidence of the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and benefits of dental sealant placement, they still remain underutilized. In 2006, the Wisconsin Medicaid program changed its policy to allow dental hygienists in school based settings, to become Medicaid certified providers for dental sealant placement. It is unclear whether this policy change has resulted in an appreciable increase in access and utilization of dental sealants as well as reduced restorative care on first molars for Medicaid- enrolled children in Wisconsin. The goal of this project is to assess whether this policy change in a public health program and system has influenced access, oral health disparities and rates of dental sealant utilization in children considered to be at high risk for dental caries. Ths study will use Medicaid claims data for 2004 to 2013 from the Electronic Data Systems of Medicaid Evaluation and Decision Support (MEDS) database for the state of Wisconsin. Using the Wisconsin Medicaid Claims data we will: 1) assess the overall utilization rates of dental sealant placement among Medicaid- enrolled children pre- and post-policy period; 2) examine the association of patients' socio- demographics, provider characteristics, designation of Dental Health Professional Area (DHPSA) and county level characteristics using Urban Influence Codes on the utilization of dental sealants; and 3) test the association between sealants placed on first molars and restorative treatment for first molars over time. Descriptive statistics and multivariate regression models will be used to estimate the effect of the policy change on the rate at which Medicaid-eligible children receive dental sealants and restorative treatment on first molars. We will control for all available covariates including child's county of residence, age and year. The study will document relevant variables associated with the policy change and the effect on public health service systems and the benefit of collaborative practice of health professionals aimed at eliminating health disparities. This secondary data analysis project is innovative, addresses oral health care disparities and provides documentation that is supportive of community-grounded efforts aimed at improving oral health. Findings from this project may influence future expansion of the policy to other states yet to adopt it, increase awareness about the benefits of sealants as a preventive measure and promote public health program development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will provide documentation regarding the influence of policy change as a driving force for improving access to care, reducing oral health disparities and increasing the utilization of preventive dental services. In addition, it provides information that could have an impact on transforming health improvement efforts through capacity building in public health programs and systems.",Dental Sealant Placements on Children's Teeth: Assessing Medicaid Policy Change,8925851,R03DE024494,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' Premolar Tooth ', ' Premolar ', ' Bicuspid Tooth ', ' Bicuspid ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dental Hygienists ', ' Dentistry ', ' Dentists ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Medicaid ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' molar (dental) ', ' Molar tooth ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Dental Sealants ', ' Pit and Fissure Sealants ', ' Plastics ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' sound ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' dental disorder ', ' dental disease ', ' Tooth Disorder ', ' Tooth Diseases ', ' United States ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' Wisconsin ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lesion ', ' Dental ', ' residence ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' tooth surface ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' treatment program ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Documentation ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Improve Access ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Update ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' electronic data ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' working group ', ' systematic review ', ' restorative treatment ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' driving force ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIDCR,MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY,R03,2015,151035,0.18792038760983923
"Family Intervention with Caregivers of Children with Dental Needs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries (tooth decay) in 2--11 year olds is increasing especially among poor and minority populations, and it is unlikely that Healthy People 2020 goals will be met. Dental screening of children in elementary schools has been mandated in 12 states and endorsed by US organizations and WHO. In spite of enthusiasm for the concept, screening and standard referral letters have been ineffective in getting parents/caregivers to take children to the dentist. Caregiver-level engagement or action is necessary to motivate follow-up on child- level interventions at schools. Thus, we propose an experimental intervention based upon the Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM) to address parent/caregiver illness perception (cognitive representation: identity, consequences, controllability, cause, timeline; and emotional representation) and navigation of resources to increase receipt of dental care for children with restorative dental needs. The Specific Aims of the proposed multi-site double-blind Phase III randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) study are: (1) Utilizing a three arm design, to evaluate the new CSM theory-driven referral letter alone or the new CSM referral letter + Dental Information Guide (DIG: facts about dental caries, hints for getting dental care, making appointments and Medicaid access, transportation and dentists availability resources) compared to a standard referral letter to increase receipt of dental care among inner-city urban African American, and rural Hispanic and White elementary school children; (2) To assess changes in parent/caregiver illness representation/perception and behavioral intention between the beginning and end of school year to understand the underlying mechanisms of the new vs. standard referral approach resulting in receipt of dental care. There will be 2 study sites: Ohio (East Cleveland City School District); Oregon (Jefferson County School District 509-J and Morrow County School District). All K-4th grade children and caregivers will be recruited through school district events. Children will be screened at beginning of the school year to determine caregiver eligibility for participation in the RCT. A total of 660 caregivers whose children have restorative dental needs will be randomized to the 3 study arms, and intervention letters will be sent home. Data collection includes: child baseline screening and follow-up dental exam at the study exit 7 mos later to determine if the child received care; caregiver illness perception questionnaire revised for dental (IPQ-RD) and a caregiver questionnaire at 3 time points (baseline, one-month after receipt of intervention letters exit). Data analysis for aim 1 includes a multivariate logistic regression model with adjustment for baseline characteristics; and aim 2 includes a generalized causal mediation analysis to delineate the mechanism (or paths) through which interventions impact dental care receipt. This behavioral intervention has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for screening by utilizing a cost- effective, easily transportable, and sustainable approach. The RCT is a collaboration of Case Western Reserve University and University of Washington Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will test an innovative behavioral approach to the referral process never attempted before. The new intervention letter and information guide are intended to change caregiver illness perception by addressing three issues - (1) knowing the importance of caries-free baby teeth for protection of permanent teeth (2) viewing dental caries as a chronic disease rather than acute or episodic; and (3) navigation of resources for dental care access. This new referral approach also has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for school screening programs required by law in many states.",Family Intervention with Caregivers of Children with Dental Needs,8926935,U01DE024167,"['Appointment ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dentists ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Family ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Laws ', ' Medicaid ', ' Ohio ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Oregon ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Private Practice ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Questionnaires ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Transportation ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Writing ', ' County ', ' Deciduous Dentition ', ' Primary Dentition ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' TimeLine ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Dental ', ' Rural ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Dentistry for Children ', ' Dental Care for Children ', ' Secondary Dentition ', ' Permanent Dentition ', ' Adult Dentition ', ' permanent tooth ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' restoration ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' inner city ', ' elementary school ', ' success ', ' care seeking ', ' Prevention program ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' 4th grade ', ' fourth grade ', ' 2nd grade ', ' second grade ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' kindergarten ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Caries prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' nine year old ', ' age 9 years ', ' 9 year old ', ' eleven year old ', ' age 11 years ', ' 11 year old ', ' demographics ', ' illness perceptions ', ' critical period ', ' primary outcome ', ' arm ', ' three-arm trial ', ' three-arm study ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' urgent care ', ' ']",NIDCR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,1007054,0.14111616459828563

This research uses existing data from an education intervention to explore psychological influences on protective parental behaviors, such as toothbrushing, and assesses the effectiveness of this new intervention at improving such behaviors.",Parental preventive behaviors and oral health in Latino children,8790752,F31DE023282,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' Preschool Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Fluorides ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Language ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Migrant ', ' Nomads ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Parents ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Solutions ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' tooth brushing ', ' Toothbrushing ', ' Toothpaste ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' base ', ' career ', ' tooth brushes ', ' toothbrush ', ' improved ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Mexican ', ' Rural ', ' sugar ', ' Funding ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavior measurement ', ' early childhood ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Population Study ', ' Modeling ', ' parent influence ', ' parental influence ', ' theories ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Preventive ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Intake ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' protective behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 year old ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F31,2015,36996,0.22062631742025354
"Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Center for Research to Reduce Disparities in Oral Health will focus on oral health concerns of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) and will be known as the Center for Native Oral Health Research (CNOHR). The Principal Investigator is Judith E. N. Albino, PhD, President Emeritus of the University of Colorado and Professor, American Indian/Alaska Native Programs (AIANP) and Craniofacial Biology, and a health psychologist. She will lead the Research Program Administrative Center (RPAC). Dr. Spero Manson, PhD, Professor and Head, AIANP, and a medical anthropologist, will serve as Co-Investigator and lead the Community Liaison and Dissemination Core within RPAC. Biostatistician William Henderson, PhD, Professor, Colorado Health Outcomes Program, will lead the Statistics and Data Coordinating Center (S&DCC). CNOHR takes a comprehensive approach to oral health disparities in the long term, with an initial focus on oral infections and key roles of behavioral factors and comorbidities. The interdisciplinary team includes scientists trained in anthropology, biostatistics, dentistry, economics, medicine, psychology, and public health, supported by experienced project management and technology teams. The three initial projects focus on caries and periodontal disease, and intervene by extending current services and their use as well as adding prevention services and oral health promotion. The first Research Component (RC1) tests an intervention with pregnant women/mothers of newborns on a Northern Plains Reservation, which is focused on the use of motivational interviewing in prevention of ECC. RC2 is a randomized clinical trial of two methods for treating periodontal disease in Southwestern American Indians who also have Type 2 diabetes mellitus. RC3 is a test of a service delivery intervention in which tribal/community members are trained to apply fluoride varnish and deliver personalized oral health education for 3-5 year old children and their parents enrolled in reservation-based Indian Head Start programs. A Developmental Research Program will offer opportunities to pilot work suggested by new investigators, by community participation and planning activities, and by preliminary results of major projects. A focus on dissemination will include activities aimed at increasing community awareness and influencing health policy. Considerable prior experience with the participating tribes and communities has shaped the CNOHR methods and approaches, and ongoing community participation in planning will continue to influence the implementation of the RCs. A robust program of training and career development experiences will include mentoring and support for students at the secondary, undergraduate, professional and graduate, and post-doctoral levels, with emphasis on recruiting AI/AN investigators to oral health disparities research.

"Detection of HPV infection in the oral cavity of Hispanics with and without periodontal disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rising rates of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers in the United States (US) and worldwide are a significant public health concern. In the US, it is estimated that 47% (~65 million) of adults aged e30 years have periodontal disease. This is of concern as studies suggest that chronic periodontitis is associated with systemic health conditions, including oral cancers. Research evaluating the role of local oral factors on natural history of oral HPV is lacking, critical information to develop effective prevention strategies. Given the scarcity of research evaluating the role of chronic oral inflammation on the natural history of oral HPV infection, assessment of the prevalence, genotypes, and correlates of oral HPV infection in the general population is a step toward a better understanding of the burden of this infection and its potential role with oral malignancies. The present cross-sectional study will capitalize on the already established infrastructure of the Study of Overweight Adults Longitudinal Study (SOALS), an ongoing NIH-funded cohort of 1,214 Hispanic adults aged 40-65 years living in the San Juan metropolitan area of Puerto Rico, to design and implement a cross-sectional study to start addressing the gaps described. Specifically, we propose to select a random subsample of 600 non-institutionalized adults who participate in SOALS to assess the prevalence and type distribution of oral HPV infection (overall, high-risk and concurrent multiple-type) in adults with and without periodontal disease, and to assess the association between HPV infection and periodontal disease severity. For the current study, assessment of both periodontal disease and oral HPV testing will be performed using validated NHANES methodology. Measures of risk factors for oral HPV infection will be collected using the audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) methodology, a useful tool for collecting sensitive risk behavioral data. Data on dental assessment, selected sociodemographic characteristics, body mass index, lifestyles, medical and dental histories, and biochemical testing will be obtained from the parent study. For HPV typing, PCR products will be typed by dot-blot hybridization using 38 type-specific probes and two separate mixtures, including oncogenic and non-oncogenic HPV types. To our knowledge, this is the first study that will assess the frequency of oral HPV infection in Hispanic adults with and without periodontal disease. The selected study population will provide us with a unique high-risk group where both periodontal disease and oral HPV infection would be higher. Hence, we can study this association with high efficiency and at a reasonable cost. If longitudinal studies in cancer-free individuals confirm that periodontal disease increases the risk of oral HPV infection, preventive public health strategies could be developed, as periodontal disease screening could identify individuals at increased risk of oral HPV infection and oral cancer, particularly among minority, low-income, and underserved populations where oral health disparities are prevalent. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Puerto Ricans are among the fastest segments of the US Hispanic population, an ethnic group characterized by having high rates of periodontal disease, HPV infection and oral cancer. Even though studies suggest a biological plausibility for the association between periodontal disease and oral HPV infection (e.g. periodontal pockets may serve as reservoir for latent HPV), studies are still inconsistent and limited in sample size and racial diversity. The identification of factors that contribute to oral HPV infection, including th potential role of periodontitis, may provide key information for the development of preventive public health strategies, as periodontal disease screening could identify individuals at increased risk of oral HPV infection and oral cancer, particularly among minority, low-income, and underserved populations

"Sugar Sweetened Beverages and Recurrent Severe Early Childhood Caries DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment of young children with Severe Early Childhood Caries (S-ECC) increasingly involves dental treatment under General Anesthesia (GA) due to lack of child cooperation in dental office settings. However, this approach does not control the disease and clinical outcomes are poor with most children developing new caries lesions within two years and some even necessitating retreatment under GA. Increasing disease-free survival time for these children would permit the child to acquire the social and self management skills to cope with in-office dental treatment, avoiding another traumatic and costly treatment episode under GA. Sugars, and particularly extrinsic sugars as those contained in Sugar Sweetened Beverages (SSBs), have been implicated as a major cause of S-ECC, yet trials of efficacious and effective dietary interventions are lacking. The objective of this R34 Clinical Trial Planning Grant is to design a Phase II RCT to assess the efficacy of an environmental dietary and behavioral change intervention, compared with the standard of care, on increasing caries-free survival time in children with S-ECC after dental treatment under GA. The experimental intervention consists of home delivery of fluoridated plain water in attractive bottles in combination with parental dietary counseling aimed to reduce SSB consumption and increase water intake. It is based on socioecological and behavior control theories (model of familial approach) to introduce new familial norms through making changes within the home environment, parental role-modeling, and increasing knowledge related to healthy eating. The primary outcome is time to relapse of dental caries during the 2-year follow up. The Specific Aims are to:  1) Develop and write the RCT clinical protocol using the NIDCR Interventional Clinical Protocol Template.  2) Coordinate IRB review and approval of the study protocol, associated consent documents and recruitment materials as required by the University of Washington (UW) and NIDCR.  3) Develop a plan for clinical monitoring to ensure fidelity of study procedures.  4) Write the Manual of Procedures (MOP) including the content, delivery, and monitoring of the intervention and its quality management (Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) The trial addresses Healthy People 2020 goals (OH-1, OH-2) and NIDCR strategic plan objectives (I-2, II-3, III- 1, IV-1, IV-2), including to reduce dental caries in primary teeth and o eliminate disparities in oral health. It is also complementary to requirements under the federal Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 for free drinking water in schools and the First Lady's initiative Let's Move! This is a project of the University of Washington Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities in collaboration with UW Center for Pediatric Dentistry, UW Center for Public Health Nutrition and UW Institute for Translational Health Sciences (ITHS). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a one-year planning grant application. The aim is to prepare an U01 proposal for a Phase II clinical trial to assess the preliminary efficacy of a dietary intervention to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages in children with severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) using time-to-onset of new dental caries as the outcome measure.

"Learning about Early Childhood Caries Prevention in a Latino Population: A Multilevel Approach ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed K99/R00 career development award application will support academic preparation and the initiation of an independent research career focused on multilevel factors associated with oral health using a strengths-based approach to reduce pediatric oral health disparities. The oral health of a child cannot be separated from family, community and the environment; thus it is vital to include a multilevel perspective in any comprehensive model of children's oral health. My research in the K99 phase will describe the maternal psychosocial and behavioral factors associated with ECC and also will describe the prevalence of dental caries in a sample of Latino children. Measures taken from the Basic Research Factors Questionnaire (BRFQ) will be used to describe psychosocial and behavioral factors (e.g., oral health locus of control, health beliefs, self- efficacy, Sense o Coherence, stress, importance of oral health, oral health knowledge and behaviors) in Latina mothers of preschool children in Denver, Colorado. The results of this study will be compared to that of a high-risk American Indian population in which similar measures from the BRFQ were used. During the R00 phase, a mixed methods approach will be used to describe the differences at child, family and community levels for caries-free and caries-active urban dwelling Latino children. This methodology will capture the factors measured by the BRFQ survey and then will use qualitative methods to further probe characteristics at each level. I will use asset mapping, which is one on the strengths-based approaches, to describe the protective health assets that enhance the ability of individuals, families, communities and social systems to maintain and sustain oral health and to help reduce oral health inequities in high risk and vulnerable groups.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research and training has three-fold relevance for public health. First, the award will promote to mentor and nurture a new investigator, who has a background in dentistry and public health and is committed to reducing oral health disparities in the United States. Second, this project will use a multidisciplinary and multi-method approach to describe the protective factors against early childhood caries in Latino children at individual, family and community level. Through this research we will be able to understand why some children, despite being at high risk for developing dental caries, remain caries-free. This will not only add essential and indispensable information to the literature but will guide other investigators in their research. Finally, this research will develop a conceptual outline for behavioral interventions based on the principles of strength based approaches in a community rather than based on pathological model.                ",Learning about Early Childhood Caries Prevention in a Latino Population: A Multilevel Approach,8966929,K99DE024758,"['American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Award ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' Preschool Child ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dentists ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environment and Public Health ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Control Locus ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mothers ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Parents ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health Dentistry ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Distal ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' health knowledge ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' Head Start ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' reservation-based ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Caries prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K99,2015,101114,0.3155904259658817
"Evaluating the Outcomes of Oral Health Workforce Policy to Increase Access to Dental Providers and Reduce Oral Health Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous states have passed expanded the dental workforce statues, allowing dental hygienists to deliver patient services to underserved children without direct supervision by a dentist. Outcomes and the cost of these policy changes in relation to eliminating oral health disparities in children are unknown. The objectives of this application are to 1) quantify the oral health and social outcomes relevant to the population of low-income, vulnerable children that are associated with expanding the dental workforce and, 2) undertake a cost analysis in a state where expanded dental hygiene workforce policy has demonstrated sustainability. For the U2 phase of this project we propose to complete three tasks: (1) Create and/or validate data collection instruments to measure relevant clinical, social and cost outcomes of children served by a statewide ECP program; (2) Establish collaborations with ECP programs (n=17) and school districts (n=108) to develop a statewide data collection strategy to evaluate clinical, social and cost outcomes of children served by a statewide ECP program; (3) Develop an appropriate curriculum to train ECP RDHs (n=41) as data collectors. For the UH3 phase of this project we propose to conduct a comprehensive, longitudinal, mixed methods policy outcomes evaluation on dentally underserved children (n=12,000). Three specific aims will accomplished during this phase: (1) Apply the multilevel Children's Oral Health Framework to identify the impact of the ECP workforce policy on children's primary and secondary oral health outcomes; (2) Conduct a cost analysis of oral health care provided by ECP RDHs; (3) Formulate evidence-based recommendations for developing dental workforce policy and delivery designs that can support oral health workforce changes, scope of practice changes, possible legislation and necessary infrastructure needed to achieve the Triple Aim. The proposed project is significant because it addresses a strategy to decrease oral health disparities in a population of low-income, largely minority children; it is innovative in its abiliy to leverage pre-existing relationships in a state with an existing oral health delivery system outside the structure of traditional private practice. The multi-disciplinary research team, assembled from academic, governmental, and practice settings, is well-positioned to successfully complete this research; expertise in dental workforce, community research, project evaluation, health policy, and cost analysis will allow us to address the core functions of the proposal. Results from the proposed research will be used to inform health policy and allow for rapid translation into oral health workforce practice, as well as advancing Goal 3 of NIDCRs Strategic Plan, ""Apply rigorous, multidisciplinary research approaches to overcome disparities in dental, oral and craniofacial health."" The varied contributions and perspectives of the multidisciplinary team will ensure results that can be applied to oral health policy. This contribution can be expected to help advance the field of health disparities research and the NIDCR's mission because findings would allow for rapid translation into oral health workforce practice and policy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to conduct a comprehensive outcomes evaluation of an existing, sustainable dental workforce policy that uses Extended Care Permit (ECP) dental hygienists to deliver oral health care to low income, minority, and rural-based children. Researchers in collaboration with the state Bureau of Oral Health and 41 ECP dental hygienists will use the ""Children's Oral Health"" conceptual model to examine changes in oral health status, oral health-related quality of life, and school attendance/performance in 12,000 dentally underserved children. A cost analysis will also be conducted.            ",Evaluating the Outcomes of Oral Health Workforce Policy to Increase Access to Dental Providers and Reduce Oral Health Disparities,8984791,UH2DE025510,"['Attention ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Data Collection ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dental Hygienists ', ' Dentists ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Kansas ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Licensure ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Private Practice ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Schools ', ' Supervision ', ' Target Populations ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Workplace ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' instrument ', ' programs ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Oral ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' restoration ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' metropolitan ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI KANSAS CITY,UH2,2015,486114,0.3370916998735062
"Good Oral Health: a Bi-level Intervention to Improve Older Adult Oral Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application will extend a successful NIDCR-funded bi-level oral health self-management pilot conducted among older/disabled adults residing in one older adult residential building to six buildings and evaluate it using a modified fractional factorial design. The theoretical framework is based on Fishbein's modified theory of reasoned action called the Integrated Model (IM) of Behavioral Prediction. It is operationalized through Adapted Motivational Interviewing, an interactive tailored cognitive approach, and Practice-to-Mastery (AMI-PM). The intervention includes two components: 1) a face to face administration of the AMI-PM; and 2) a targeted building-level campaign that includes principles of practice to master (CA-PM). The specific aims are to: 1) Test the two main components of a bi-level intervention to improve clinical oral hygiene outcomes in relation to one another, and through differential sequencing. 2) Identify cognitive and behavioral mechanisms contributing to clinical oral hygiene outcomes. 3) Assess impact and sustainability of behavioral and clinical outcomes over time. The intervention will be carried out in three cycles of 150 participants each for a total of N=450. Each cycle will include two buildings matched by size and ethnic/linguistic composition housing older adults and those with disabilities. In one condition, the individual leve intervention will be introduced followed by the group level intervention. In the second condition, the group level intervention will precede the individual level. Survey and clinical measures taken at baseline, and following the administration of the first and second components. This design will enable comparison of the short term efficacy of the individual versus group level component (T1 - T2) and the shorter and longer term efficacy of the interventions (T3 - 3 months). Clinical measures at T4, 6 months later, will evaluate sustainability of effect. Primary outcome measures are gingival index and plaque score, both of which improved significantly in the pilot study. Significance lies in the potential of the intervention to address critical disparities in oral healh through oral health promotion initiatives in the locations where they reside as well as the ability to evaluate the intervention efficiently using a design alternative to the RCT. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study's primary significance lies in the potential of this bi-level intervention to address significant disparities in oral health and consequent morbidity or reduced quality of life among vulnerable, low-income and primarily minority older adults and those with disabilities through prevention in the locations where they reside.

"Modeling childhood dental caries patterns for genomic and epigenetic analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries is the most common chronic disease in US children, and has actually increased in prevalence among young children in the last decade. Untreated childhood dental caries has a profound negative impact on quality of life, leading to many serious comorbidities, including chronic pain, tooth loss, difficulty hearing, eating, and sleeping, and failure to thrive, as well as poor school performance, social relationships, and self image, and decreased success later in life. In response to these negative health and social consequences, dental caries has become a focal issue in efforts to reduce public health disparities for both the NIDCR and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Treatment of dental caries consumes over $50 billion annually in dental health care costs; however, these expenditures are unfortunately concentrated in a caries management paradigm of surgical restoration (or extraction), which treats the symptoms of dental caries, while ignoring the root causes of disease. This approach disadvantages those with socioeconomic, geographic, or logistical barriers to accessing routine dental care. In order to shift the caries management paradigm to a model of risk assessment, early intervention, and recurrence prevention, the etiological factors controlling caries susceptibility will need to be identified. Our project seeksto fill this need, focusing on the genetic factors contributing to disease and applying innovative statistical methods of modeling dental caries experience. Indeed, studies shown that up to 60% of variation in caries experience may be attributed to host genetics; however, little is presently known about the specific genetic variants that contribute to cariogenesis, how these genes interact with environmental risk factors, and whether inherited epigenetic factors are also involved. This proposal will seek to fill the gap in knowledge regarding the environmental and genetic factors leading to childhood dental caries by modeling the patterns of caries across the dentition. We will conduct genome-wide association analysis utilizing two existing samples totaling 1,500 children aged 3 to 12 years with quality caries and risk factor assessments and available genotype data from a high-throughput microarray platform. We hypothesize that the effects exerted by risk factors lead to patterns of decay, which can be modeled, and in turn used for identifying and characterizing the environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors involved. Understanding the complex interplay between genetic and environmental contributors to dental caries may lead to never-before-considered targets for intervention, heralding the era of personalized medicine where dental caries management will be tailored to a patient's specific suite of genetic and environmental liabilities. The potential gains of this project are enormous and come at minimal costs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will provide much-needed understanding of the patterns, environmental risk factors, and genetic contributors of dental caries in children. Ultimately, understanding the factors contributing to dental caries may lead to improved risk assessment and novel targets for interventions, and may inform strategies for personalized management and public policy positions.                ",Modeling childhood dental caries patterns for genomic and epigenetic analysis,8822554,R03DE024264,"['Genes ', ' Behavioral Genetics ', ' behavior genetics

"Predoctoral Fellowship in Public and Community Health- Oral Health Status & Dental Care Utilization of Mexican Americans with Diabetes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will use qualitative and statistical methods to 1) Describe the distribution of diabetes markers, health behaviors, socio-demographic characteristics and their association with oral health status outcomes of Mexican Americans by acculturation status; 2) Examine the associations between diabetes and oral health status outcomes by acculturation level for Mexican Americans; and 3) Explore the individual-level and environmental level antecedent and empowerment factors that mediate oral health utilization for Mexican Americans with diabetes by acculturation level. Research design and methodology: A statistical analysis will be conducted using the 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to assess the oral health status (periodontal disease status, number of teeth present, self-reported use dental floss, and self-rating of their teeth/gums) of more-and less-acculturated Mexican Americans by diabetes status. Statistical analyses for each oral health status outcome will evaluate acculturation status using [[three]] acculturation construct measures (nativity, citizenship status, language use) and relevant covariates. The results from the secondary data analyses will be used to define the thresholds of acculturation status comparisons used in four qualitative focus groups conducted with less- and more-acculturated Mexican American. The goal of these focus groups is to supplement the intricacies of the acculturation experience that are not captured by proxy measures in Specific Aim 1 and 2 and explore more in depth how individual and environmental level antecedent and empowerment factors shape intention to seek care and mediate receipt of oral health for Mexican Americans with diabetes by acculturation level. Analysis of focus groups will be inductive, using grounded theory. The results of this study will help identify the subgroup of Mexican Americans with diabetes with the highest oral health needs by acculturation status as well as provide insights on the facilitators and barriers to dental care utilization in this population. Relevance to the NIDCR's mission and research priorities: This study addresses the NIDCR's mission to apply multidisciplinary approaches to promote oral health and to prevent oral diseases and related disabilities particularly in special populations that suffer from disparities in oral diseases experienced and utilization of preventative care. Mexican Americans are the largest Latino ethnic subgroup population in the US and also have the highest level of unmet dental needs and dental care underutilization. Concurrent with disparities in oral health, Mexican Americans are also disproportionately burdened with diabetes which has been associated with several oral conditions. This study has the potential of informing tailored interventions aimed at improving the oral health and utilization of dental services for Mexican Americans with diabetes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mexican Americans are disproportionately burdened by oral health conditions which points to a critical public health issue since many oral health conditions are associated with systemic chronic conditions like diabetes.

"Predicting Caries Risk in Underserved Toddlers in Primary Healthcare Settings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dental caries, the most common chronic disease of childhood, is a largely preventable disease. This proposal focuses on addressing inequities in dental caries experience among preschool aged U.S. children. It has been inspired by the shift and increase in dental caries among subsets of the population (i.e., 2-5 year old children, especially from underserved/minority population groups) that calls for a greater focus on targeted healthcare. In an environment of increasing healthcare costs and resource constraints, this approach is paramount in addressing oral health disparities. Because children have multiple well-child pediatric visits in the early years of life, many lower socioeconomic status (SES) and minority children have much greater access to medical care than to dental care. Our long-term goal is to reduce disparities in dental caries experience in young children in the U.S. by developing effective risk-based caries preventive and therapeutic strategies to be delivered through new models for oral health care, including primary medical healthcare settings. However, the problem is that currently there is no practical, validated and easily-scored tool practitioners can use to accurately and reliably assess, and effectively triage children at the highest risk for caries. Such an urgently needed tool will be developed in this proposed research. Thus, the objective of this study is to validate a caries risk questionnaire in order to develop a practical and easily-scored caries risk tool for use in primary medical healthcare settings to identify young, diverse U.S. children (1-4 years of age) with the highest risk for the development of caries. This will be accomplished by having the parents of 1,326 infants complete a caries risk questionnaire and by performing caries examinations on the children at baseline (child's age 12 + 3 months old), and again at 18 months (child's age 30 + 3 months) and 36 months after the baseline (child's age 48 + 3 months) to monitor the caries disease process, and how well the risk tool predicts caries risk status as the child ages. A great strength of this proposal is that it involves four experienced investigator groups who offer strong partnerships between medical and dental teams, and three study sites with well established primary care medical research networks that provide access and facilitate follow up to a variety of at-risk, diverse populations, including ethnic and racial minorities and low SES groups. Each study site also has an NIH Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA), and will benefit from infrastructure and experience in longitudinal clinical translational research. The significance of this work is that identification of high caries risk children in primary healthcare settings allows cost-effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed, targeted and used in these settings to prevent early childhood caries. This will have immediate broad impact and influence on existing dental and medical policies and programs regarding screening and prevention of dental caries among young children from diverse disadvantaged and underserved subgroups, in primary medical and dental pediatric healthcare settings.          The relevance of this collaborative, innovative and high impact project between physicians and dentists is that it will result in a valid, reliable, and practical (easy to score) caries risk assessment tool for the identification of high caries risk infants/toddlers in primary medical healthcare settings allowing for cost effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed and targeted to prevent early childhood caries, and help reduce disparities in caries experience.

"COordinated Oral health Promotion (CO-OP) Chicago ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Almost half of children 11 years old and younger suffer from dental caries, making caries one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood. Low income and minority children bear a disproportionate portion of this burden. In Chicago, these disparities are obvious with 63% of Chicago-area 3rd-graders having dental caries and over half of these caries are untreated. Pediatric dental caries are associated with pain, more severe infections, malnutrition, speech difficulties, poor school performance, cosmetic problems, and an overall lower quality of life. While many oral health interventions have been developed to reduce the incidence of caries, even the most successful programs have limited effectiveness in high risk children. The delivery and receipt of proper preventive oral healthcare involves social and environmental factors that operate on individual, family, and community levels. Multi-level interventions recognize the need to target these levels simultaneously but multi-level oral health interventions for the primary prevention of dental caries are lacking. COordinated Oral health Promotion (CO-OP) Chicago brings together a team of clinical pediatricians and dentists, researchers, health psychologists, and policy experts to rigorously test the ability of an oral health promotion intervention to improve child and family oral health. The primary intervention is family-focused education and support from community health workers (CHWs); this intervention will be applied in a range of settings to determine which settings, or combination of settings, result in the best outcomes. The Aim of the UH2 Phase is to formalize partnerships and finalize study design and protocol. This includes: 1) A formative assessment to determine partner operations, resources, and needs; 2) CHW training; 3) Pilot testing of recruitment and intervention protocols; 4) Creation of a final Manual of Procedures; and 5) Obtain clearances/contracts from all institutional and community partners. The UH3 Phase then implements and evaluates the intervention in 15 clinics, 15 WIC sites, and 1520 individual families. Aim 1 is to evaluate the ability of a clinic-based family-focused CHW intervention to improve child oral health; Aim 2 evaluates the ability of a WIC-based family-focused CHW intervention to improve child oral health; Aim 3 evaluates the ability of a home-based family-focused CHW intervention to improve child oral health; and Aim 4 determines the added value of combining interventions. The hypothesis is that participants receiving home-based CHWs and clinic-based or WIC-based CHW interventions will have the best oral health outcomes at 12-months. The primary outcome is incidence of early childhood caries, determined by the Caries Severity Index.

"Integrating Interactive Parent Text Messaging and Oral Health Guidelines into Pediatric Community Health Centers to Reduce Early Childhood Caries ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to RFA-DE-15-006 ""Multidisciplinary and Collaborative Research Consortium to Reduce Oral Health Disparities in Children: A Multi-level Approach."" The prevalence of Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is increasing, disproportionately affecting racial and ethnic minorities (Dye, 2007). Prevention efforts for high risk groups require multi-level strategies. We will target parents/legal guardians of children (<6 years) during pediatric well-child visits at urban community health centers (CHCs), and provide a text-message based ECC prevention intervention. We will also target the pediatric providers in the CHCs to adopt oral health guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and also improve documentation within their Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Thus, our multi-level intervention includes children, parents, providers and the CHC system. 85% of adults use text messaging, with no disparities by race/ethnicity, education or income. The benefits of text message interventions include the use anywhere/anytime, low cost, scalability to large populations, ability to tailor message content and intensity, and provision of strategies in real time. CHCs are an ideal venue for oral health promotion both at an individual level (they provide care to the groups at highest risk for ECC) and at a population level (there are 90 CHCs electronically linked locally and >1,100 CHCs nationally). In Phase 1 (UH2), we will conduct focus groups and interviews with parents and CHC providers to inform the development of the oral health text message intervention, as well as assess CHC work flow to identify sustainable strategies for oral health integration and eventual dissemination. This formative work is vital to ensure cultural and environmental compatibility, as we have done previously. The text messages will be consistent with AAP guidelines, our theoretical model (Social Cognitive Theory), and our previous work. We will use the Fisher-Owens Model (2007) as an intervention planning framework. In Phase 2 (UH3), 850 parents/legal guardians of children <6 years attending our target CHCs will be randomized to receive one of two dose-equivalent text message interventions: Oral Health Texts (OHT) or Child Wellness Texts (CWT). The primary outcome variable will be ECC incidence at 24 months. We will assess mediators and moderators of the intervention effect, perform a budget impact analysis to determine the financial consequences of adoption, diffusion, and sustainability of the OHT intervention at CHCs, assess CHC changes in oral health promotion (provider practices and EHR documentation), and assess changes in both pediatric and parent oral health behaviors. This research has strong potential to be an evidence based program that could easily be adopted at low cost and low provider burden in the 1,128 CHCs in the U.S. that treat almost 4.5 million high risk children <6 years old. Our text message intervention is innovative because involves system-generated real time support, tailoring, feedback, and interactivity. Our study has theoretical significance because it integrates a testable theory with an intervention planning model to elucidate mechanisms of change at multiple levels.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Despite the fact that early childhood caries (ECC) is preventable, it is the most common chronic childhood disease in the US, affecting 28% of those aged 2-5, and disproportionately affecting poor and minority groups. We propose an interactive text messaging intervention delivered to parents of children younger than 6 years old, which aims to foster healthy parent behaviors and reduce ECC in their children. This novel, low cost approach has the potential to expand the ability of community health center (CHC) pediatric clinics to efficiently integrate oral health promotion into their practice and could easily be disseminated to the 1200 CHCs in the United States that treat 4.5 million children younger than 6, most of whom are at high risk for ECC.            ",Integrating Interactive Parent Text Messaging and Oral Health Guidelines into Pediatric Community Health Centers to Reduce Early Childhood Caries,8984333,UH2DE025492,"['Academy ', ' Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Budgets ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Diffusion ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Dyes ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Feedback ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Fluorides ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health behavior ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' Legal Guardians ', ' Lip ', ' Lip structure ', ' literacy ', ' Maps ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Parents ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Testing ', ' fabric ', ' Textiles ', ' Time ', ' tooth brushing ', ' Toothbrushing ', ' Toothpaste ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' tooth brushes ', ' toothbrush ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Lifting ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Oral ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Caries prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' six year old ', ' age 6 years ', ' 6 year old ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Evidence based program ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,UH2,2015,625436,0.25746069700629615
"A Prospective Investigation of the Oral Microbiome and Pancreatic Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer is a highly fatal disease (five-year survival rate of only 6%) with virtually no current opportunities for meaningful efforts towards primary or secondary prevention. It is the fourth most common cause of cancer death for both men and women in the US. African Americans are disproportionately burdened with the highest pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality rates in the US - about 30% higher than the group with the next highest rates, non-Hispanic whites. The current lack of knowledge on factors that could be useful for primary prevention or for identifying high-risk groups for potential screening or intervention is a major impediment to improving the poor outlook for this cancer. Evidence has been mounting, including pilot results generated for the current application, that commensal and pathogenic oral bacteria may play a role in pancreatic cancer development. If this is the case, and if the relevant characteristics of the oral microbiota can be identified, this could be a major breakthrough in our ability to prevent pancreatic cancer, because the oral ecology is modifiable. We see the emergence of new microbial gene sequencing and bioinformatics methods as a fundamental opportunity to study how oral microbial communities may contribute to pancreatic cancer risk and disparities. Leveraging the existing resources of two prospective, epidemiologic studies, the Southern Community Cohort Study and the Black Women's Health Study, we propose to substantially advance this emerging line of enquiry by conducting a comprehensive investigation of the oral microbiome and pancreatic cancer. We will do so within established parent cohorts that are uniquely situated to include African Americans (as well as European Americans) and to address potential racial differences in the oral microbiome as drivers of the excess burden of pancreatic cancer among African Americans. In a nested case-control study of 125 incident pancreatic cancer cases and 450 controls, using pre-diagnostic oral rinse samples, we will employ high-output genomic shotgun sequencing to characterize and compare the oral microbiome of cases and controls, hypothesizing that microbial abundance, diversity, and/or function will differ between these groups (Aim 1). Among the controls, we will also evaluate racial differences in the oral microbiome and identify any differences that may explain the increased incidence of pancreatic cancer among African Americans (Aim 2). We will further determine the association between recognized, modifiable risk factors for pancreatic cancer (cigarette smoking, obesity, red meat and processed meat consumption, alcohol consumption, type 2 diabetes) and oral microbiome attributes, and evaluate whether these exposures are associated with high-risk oral microbiome profiles (Aim 3). This study could have both immediate and long-term major impact by opening the doors for new mechanistic research as well as translational activities including manipulating the microbiome for cancer prevention, developing therapies related to the microbiome, and ultimately reducing the incidence of, and disparities in, pancreatic cancer.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pancreatic cancer is a highly fatal disease with an enigmatic racial disparity and virtually no current opportunities for effective primary or secondary prevention efforts. The need for knowledge gains in these areas is thus profound. Prompted by mounting evidence that normal and pathogenic oral bacteria may play a role in pancreatic cancer development, the proposed investigation of the composition and function of the oral microbiome in relation to pancreatic cancer will provide some of the first prospective data addressing this novel question and could have immediate impact by spurring translational activities aimed at reducing the incidence of, and disparities in, pancreatic cancer.                ",A Prospective Investigation of the Oral Microbiome and Pancreatic Cancer,8964197,U01CA187508,"['Affect ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Antibodies ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Meat ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Nested Case-Control Study ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Chronic Periodontitis ', ' Periodontitis ', ' Play ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Tooth Loss ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' cancer prevention ', ' tool ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Oral ', ' microorganism ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' oral flora ', ' oral bacteria ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Controlled Study ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Shotgun Sequencing ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' microbiome ', ' Human Microbiome ', ' oral diagnostics ', ' total oral microbial community ', ' oral microbiome ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' microbial community ', ' modifiable risk ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' Metagenomics ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,U01,2015,498385,0.19942398049840657
"A Tailored Approach to Reducing Oral Health Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The efficacy of dental treatments often varies according to patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity). These variations are called heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTEs). Understanding how patient characteristics interact with treatment is key to improving treatment decisions for individual patients and for developing targeted treatments to reduce oral health disparities. However, studies that purport to show HTEs include numerous examples of misleading claims that have been later overturned (e.g., the lack of effectiveness of antihypertensive treatment in elderly patients has been refuted). Unfortunately, we lack the design and analysis strategies that can identify and confirm patient characteristics that cause HTEs. Our long-term goal is to develop HTE analytic strategies that can be used to personalize disease management and treatment, including preventive treatments. In pursuit of that goal, our primary aim is to develop an HTE framework that can identify a panel of patient characteristics that cause HTEs. Compared to traditional exploratory HTE methods, our new framework will identify complex interactions among patient characteristics. Our second aim is to demonstrate how the framework can be used to identify and confirm a panel of patient characteristics that cause HTEs in two NIDCR-funded caries prevention trials. Finally, our third aim is to develop freely available software to provide researchers with the needed tools to apply this framework to all dental trials. The proposed research is significant because it will provide dental researchers with the analytic tools they need to rigorously and effectively identify and confirm a panel of patient characteristics that cause HTEs. This study is aligned with the NIDCR's 2014-2019 strategic plan (Goal II) to enable precise and personalized oral healthcare through research and the National Research Council's endorsement of the emerging field of precision health. This project will also be highly time and cost effective because it will leverage the resources of two existing RCTs, an efficient use of current NIDCR studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients and dentists often make treatment decisions based on data representing the average (or overall) study results. This decision assumes that the average study population represents an individual patient even though a ""real"" patient is likely different from the average patient, in terms of demographic or health behavior characteristics, known as heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTEs). This new strategy to identify patient characteristic that cause HTEs, proposed in this study, is aligned with NIDCR's 2014-2019 goal to enable precise and personalized oral health-care through research. NIDCR is committed to being at the leading edge of this development to embrace personalized, precision healthcare. A first step toward developing effective and personalized disease-management is improving the analytic strategies that can be used to identify and confirm HTEs, as proposed in this study.            ",A Tailored Approach to Reducing Oral Health Disparities,8893773,R03DE024262,"['Age ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Measurin ', ' Extren ', ' Entericin ', ' Empirin ', ' Ecotrin ', ' Aspergum ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' 2-(Acetyloxy)benzoic Acid ', ' Aspirin ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Dentists ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Literature ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' National Research Council ', ' National Research Council (U.S.) ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Patients ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' tool ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' simulation ', ' Population Study ', ' Documentation ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Clinical Trials Database ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Caries prevention ', ' treatment effect ', ' comparative ', ' computer generated ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2015,158375,0.20965213503991093
"Validating OCT and Raman spectroscopy for assessment of tooth de/remineralization     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries continues to be prevalent in children and youth, with significant oral health disparities existing in some population groups. This disease arises when the balance between pathological factors (e.g. cariogenic bacteria) and protective factors (e.g. saliva flow) is tipped in favour of demineralization. The prevalence of caries suggests that the disease is not being effectively managed with an emphasis traditionally on restorative procedures where caries lesions are already serious. Dentistry is undergoing a paradigm shift away from surgical treatment of caries to a medical model of disease prevention and management. This change aims to address the disease cause with minimally invasive CAries Management By Risk Assessment (CAMBRA) efforts. For this paradigm to be successful, dentists need better tools to detect early lesions. Early detection will allow dentists to monitor and counsel patients in managing caries risk factors to help prevent disease progression. We hypothesize that the combination of morphological and biochemical information provided by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and polarized Raman spectroscopy (PRS), respectively, can provide clinicians with an improved tool to detect and assess early caries lesions as well as to be used for both short- and long-term monitoring for better caries management. The overall objective of this competitive renewal proposal is to develop a novel software and hardware clinical platform based on a combined OCT-PRS intra-oral probe for early dental caries detection and assessment. To achieve this goal we plan to: 1) establish a clinic-friendly software platform to derive caries relevant parameters from the OCT-PRS data, 2) develop combined OCT-PRS caries assessment intra-oral probes for proximal and occlusal surfaces, and finally 3) validate the hardware and software for clinical utility in caries detectio and assessment through two small scale clinical studies. Our research will provide novel automated software algorithms to provide clinicians with measures of caries presence, lesion extent, quantitative assessment of caries lesion activity and mineralization status during the examination of the patient. The proposed developments and evidence-based findings will support a paradigm shift in treating caries as a disease. This research supports the new US Healthy People 2020 program in which an oral health objective is to reduce caries and untreated decay among children and adolescents.          Dental decay (dental caries) is preventable and curable, yet it is among the most common chronic diseases affecting children in the USA with significant oral health disparities existing in some population groups. The proposed research will provide clinicians with improved tools to detect and assess early dental caries for better caries management.

"Caregiver Illness Perception and Childs Early Childhood Caries Status DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tooth decay in 2 to 11 year olds is increasing and dental utilization is lower nationally especially among poor and minority populations, while untreated primary tooth decay has remained steady. With these statistics, it is unlikely that Healthy People 2020 goals will be met. The Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM) was developed to understand individual's perception of chronic illness and for effective self-management of disease (Leventhal et al. 1997). The CSM concept has been applied to medical conditions. Except for the applicant's sponsor, the CSM framework and the questionnaire assessing CSM concepts (Illness Perception Questionnaire revised for dental: IPQ-RD) have not yet been investigated for children's or parent's perceptions of their dental problems. Building on the work of my sponsor, the overall goal of my proposed F32 research is to utilize the CSM and the behavioral model of health services use (Andersen 1968) to determine how predisposing and enabling factors, and need influence parents' illness perception of their child's dental caries (tooth decay). The objectives of this research training fellowship are: (1) A matched case control study design will compare if parent/caregivers of young children (< 6 years) who have severe early childhood caries (cases: S-ECC) versus those of parent/caregivers of children without early childhood caries (controls) are different in IPQ-RD scores; (2) A path model will investigate the effect of parent/caregiver predisposing (socio- demographic, oral health behavior, knowledge, attitude, beliefs, psychosocial factors, dental fear), enabling (dental insurance, access, personal dentist, perception of dental system), need (routine/preventive vs. problematic care) related factors on IPQ-RD, which in turn affects the likelihood of being in the case or control group. The sample size of 120 (60 case caregivers and 60 control caregivers) will be recruited from a hospital based dental clinic setting. Data collectin will involve abstraction of decayed, missing, filled primary teeth from clinic charts to determine case and control status, and two self-administered questionnaires (IPQ-RD and caregiver questionnaire). The parent/caregiver will provide consent and complete questionnaires at the time of child's routine care dental visit (controls) and at the time of restorative treatment under general anesthesia in OR (case). Data analysis will include descriptive statistics, conditional logistic regression, and structural equations [PATH] modeling approach. This research responds to NIDCR's 2009-2013 Strategic Plan I-2 ""Increase the Institute's commitment to basic and applied research in the behavioral and social sciences""; II-2 ""Emphasize the training and career development investment of individuals""; II-3 ""Welcome new disciplines poised to expand oral, dental, and craniofacial research""; IV-1 ""Identify the full range of factors that contribute to ora health inequalities"". . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed fellowship research study will assess the illness perception of parent/caregivers of children with severe tooth decay compared to children without tooth decay. This research will build on limited work in this area of understanding the perception of parent/caregivers towards their child's tooth decay.

"Determining high risk HPV status in the underserved ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 40,000 people will be diagnosed with oral cancer this year and over 8,000 people will die from this disease. Men suffer from oral cancer at a rate four times greater than women. The incidence and mortality rate for African American/black (AA/B) and white women in the U.S. is fairly similar. AA/B and white males also have a similar disease incidence; however, AA/B males die at a rate 3-4 times that of their white counterparts. Socioeconomic status resulting in limited access to healthcare for the poor has played a large role in that disparity, with more AA/B men being diagnosed with metastatic disease which is linked to poor prognosis. Historically a disease of tobacco and/or alcohol abuse, oral cancer was declining as a result of decreases in smoking but the decline slowed around the year 2000 when a new cause, with increasing incidence, was identified. That new oral cancer agent was the human papilloma virus (HPV). It has now been suggested that white males are more likely than AA/B males to have HPV-positive oral cancer, a form of the disease that responds better to therapy, and this is driving the disparity in mortality. Studies actually quantifying HPV in tumors of AA/B males are few and more work needs to be done to confirm that that is the case. More recent reports suggest that AA/B and white males have similar incidence of HPV-positive oral cancer, but the progression of the disease is different in AA/B individuals. In this study, we will ask and answer the following questions: 1) do AA/B and white males from underserved populations have similar amounts of HPV+ oral cancer, 2) are the HPV subtypes the same in these two groups and, 3) is the progression of HPV-associated cellular and molecular changes the same for AA/B and white individuals and could late stage at diagnosis be a result of differing disease progression rather than delayed diagnosis? The answers to these questions will be analyzed along with other variables that are associated with prognosis, such as age at diagnosis, stage at diagnosis, tumor grade, a history of risk factors such as alcohol and tobacco abuse, therapy prescribed, completion of therapy and response to therapy. This comprehensive assessment will lend incredible insight into the reasons for the high death rate for AA/B men and will result in future research that will depend upon the outcomes of this work. This could include education and outreach towards the prevention of HPV infection and the development of new therapies specific for HPV- positive oral cancer. This work is important because oral cancer is a painful and destructive disease with poor outcomes for all and disproportionately so for AA/B males. The disparity in mortality cannot be adequately addressed until the factors contributing to it are identified.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Black males in the U.S. die from cancers of the oral cavity and oropharynx at a rate two to three times greater than their white counterparts. The reason for this disparity is likely multifactorial, but it is thought that some, or possibly much, of this disarity is due either to a difference in the number of cases caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), a difference in the type of HPV and/or a difference in the way HPV affects the oral target cells. This research evaluates these three factors in an underserved population consisting of, roughly, equal parts black and white individuals (predominantly males) to begin to determine whether this virus is a major determinant of racial disparities in outcome for people suffering from this debilitating, painful, and frequently fatal, disease.                ",Determining high risk HPV status in

"Planning a Stage II Trial to Prevent ECC Progression     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project addresses the need for a rigorous trial to test the efficacy of a behavioral intervention to control Early Childhood Caries (ECC) among affected low-income Hispanic children. ECC remains a highly prevalent and consequential chronic disease (44% of U.S. children affected by age 5 years) and minority, immigrant, and low-income populations experience disproportionately high occurrence, severity, and lack of treatment. Largely preventable, ECC results in avoidable pain and infection for children, stress and lost work productivity for caregivers, and costly surgical repair by dentists. Standard practice treats ECC primarily through surgical dental repair, an approach that addresses neither the natural history of the disease nor the family-level behavioral determinants that mediate its occurrence (i.e., dietary habits and home fluoride use). As professional consensus emerges regarding the value of behavioral disease management for ECC, these approaches remain largely unstudied, notably so among high-risk Hispanic children. MySmileBuddy, developed and piloted through our prior NIH research grant, has been shown to be acceptable to our target audience of immigrant Hispanic families and feasible to implement by Community Health Workers. MySmileBuddy uses innovative health technology to assess a child's ECC risk, inform parents about the caries process, develop tailored oral health goals, and create a family- centered action plan bolstered by social support. The proposed project will prepare for a behavioral randomized controlled trial (B-RCT) of MySmileBuddy by developing: organizational and management structures; detailed descriptions of roles and responsibilities of study personnel; partnerships with key organizations to assure feasibility; and logistics for study implementation, including cohort recruitment and retention, sample size determination, measurements, data collection and analysis procedures. The proposed project will develop a U01 proposal for a B-RCT by developing: a Clinical Protocol, Manual of Procedures, and Detailed Timeline that spell out plans for collecting, managing, securing, and analyzing data; assessing MySmileBuddy's cost-effectiveness; and reporting and disseminating findings. The study design and training plans will maximize intervention implementation and protocol fidelity and ensure the reliability and validity of measurements. The significance of this R34 planning work is that it will assure a B- RCT that is methodologically sound and ready to implement. The theoretical significance of the B-RCT is improved understanding of the behavioral determinants of ECC progression, while the practical and policy- relevant significance is substantiating a low-cost behavioral complement to contemporary surgical care that can reduce or eliminate ongoing disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to plan for a Stage II behavioral randomized controlled trial (B-RCT) of the MySmileBuddy intervention to test the effectiveness of this innovative, family-centered, technology-assisted, behavioral intervention to manage Early Childhood Caries among affected low-income Hispanic children. A second primary aim of this planning project is to develop a U01 application for the proposed B-RCT. If successful, the proposed intervention will reduce disease progression in a highly vulnerable population, promote a shift in current practice of pediatric dentistry toward disease prevention and control, and represent a significant step toward reducing ethnic-racial disparities in oral health.            ",Planning a Stage II Trial to Prevent ECC Progression,8823448,R34DE023158,"['Affect

"Detection of HPV infection in the oral cavity of Hispanics with and without periodontal disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rising rates of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers in the United States (US) and worldwide are a significant public health concern. In the US, it is estimated that 47% (~65 million) of adults aged e30 years have periodontal disease. This is of concern as studies suggest that chronic periodontitis is associated with systemic health conditions, including oral cancers. Research evaluating the role of local oral factors on natural history of oral HPV is lacking, critical information to develop effective prevention strategies. Given the scarcity of research evaluating the role of chronic oral inflammation on the natural history of oral HPV infection, assessment of the prevalence, genotypes, and correlates of oral HPV infection in the general population is a step toward a better understanding of the burden of this infection and its potential role with oral malignancies. The present cross-sectional study will capitalize on the already established infrastructure of the Study of Overweight Adults Longitudinal Study (SOALS), an ongoing NIH-funded cohort of 1,214 Hispanic adults aged 40-65 years living in the San Juan metropolitan area of Puerto Rico, to design and implement a cross-sectional study to start addressing the gaps described. Specifically, we propose to select a random subsample of 600 non-institutionalized adults who participate in SOALS to assess the prevalence and type distribution of oral HPV infection (overall, high-risk and concurrent multiple-type) in adults with and without periodontal disease, and to assess the association between HPV infection and periodontal disease severity. For the current study, assessment of both periodontal disease and oral HPV testing will be performed using validated NHANES methodology. Measures of risk factors for oral HPV infection will be collected using the audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) methodology, a useful tool for collecting sensitive risk behavioral data. Data on dental assessment, selected sociodemographic characteristics, body mass index, lifestyles, medical and dental histories, and biochemical testing will be obtained from the parent study. For HPV typing, PCR products will be typed by dot-blot hybridization using 38 type-specific probes and two separate mixtures, including oncogenic and non-oncogenic HPV types. To our knowledge, this is the first study that will assess the frequency of oral HPV infection in Hispanic adults with and without periodontal disease. The selected study population will provide us with a unique high-risk group where both periodontal disease and oral HPV infection would be higher. Hence, we can study this association with high efficiency and at a reasonable cost. If longitudinal studies in cancer-free individuals confirm that periodontal disease increases the risk of oral HPV infection, preventive public health strategies could be developed, as periodontal disease screening could identify individuals at increased risk of oral HPV infection and oral cancer, particularly among minority, low-income, and underserved populations where oral health disparities are prevalent. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Puerto Ricans are among the fastest segments of the US Hispanic population, an ethnic group characterized by having high rates of periodontal disease, HPV infection and oral cancer. Even though studies suggest a biological plausibility for the association between periodontal disease and oral HPV infection (e.g. periodontal pockets may serve as reservoir for latent HPV), studies are still inconsistent and limited in sample size and racial diversity. The identification of factors that contribute to oral HPV infection, including th potential role of periodontitis, may provide key information for the development of preventive public health strategies, as periodontal disease screening could identify individuals at increased risk of oral HPV infection and oral cancer, particularly among minority, low-income, and underserved populations

"Using Social Networks to Improve Oral Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Public housing development (PHD) residents typically lack the resources and information necessary to maintain good oral health. Children living in PHDs are at increased risk for oral health disparities as the social conditions are thought to hinder the flow of useful and actionable health information, and undermine exemplary health behavior practices. Current oral health research tools are insufficient to accurately characterize PHD resident interactions and to understand how the social relationships of caregivers may be effectively leveraged to improve their children's oral health. To date, disparities research has no adequately accounted for the heterogeneity of factors interacting in a web of influences nor permitted practical measurement of them. Network Science is ideally suited for investigating complex systems. Social networks have been conceived as key linking mechanisms characterizing interactions within a system. We will use Network Science methods to design and implement a network intervention, guided by the diffusion of innovations theory. The intervention will focus on both interactions between residents of PHDs, and the upstream influences operating within and among networks that affect more proximal pathways to health status. Our proposed multi-level intervention is aimed at producing individual, network and community-level outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that controlled dissemination of information targeting changes in health behaviors through social networks will accelerate the uptake of knowledge, support the adoption of positive behavior change, and improve oral health status of caregivers and their young children. During the formative UH2 phase, a multidisciplinary team of investigators will identify and characterize the structural properties of PHD members' networks that shape the flow of health information, resources and support. We will rely on community-based participatory research to maximally leverage our established, long-term links with community partners. In the UH3 phase, we will conduct an intervention to determine whether and how networks may be used to promote and accelerate health behavior changes. We will target caregivers of children ages 1-5 years, with 18-24 months' follow-up to ascertain the effectiveness of network activation through disseminated messages to acquiring knowledge and promoting behavior change with respect to healthy dietary choices, particularly reductions in sugar-sweetened beverage consumption. The research plan represents a major methodological improvement to the current state of the science as it addresses the complex systems' nature of oral health disparities. It will enhance our understanding of oral health disparities through bette characterization of the behaviors, social interactions (including interactions with health systems) and community features related to the information PHD residents utilize to make sense of, and act on, their health. Similar Network Science approaches in other fields have shown increased sustainability of behavior change over and above that of individualized efforts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although public housing is often known for demographics related to poor health, the social mechanisms giving rise to negative health outcomes are not well understood. We propose to study how residents of public housing interact in social networks to better explain how they use and spread knowledge about health and health behaviors and the impact these links have on dental health.

"Oral Health Equity in Alaska (OHEAL): Implementation and Evaluation of Delivery System Changes to Reduce Oral Health Disparities for Native American Children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) children are particularly affected by disparities in oral health: AIAN children have double the caries experience of white children and 2 to 3 times higher rates of untreated caries. Despite great resilience in tribal nations, geographical isolation, dentist shortages, and community mistrust on health care systems exacerbate the inequity. In Alaska, Dental Health Aides, drawn from indigenous communities, are available to provide preventive and interim care and to serve as patient navigators so that children receive curative care. Disparities could be reduced if the dental care delivery system, including the community-based allied dental personnel, were more effective. However, no studies have yet evaluated the incorporation of evidence-based dental treatments into routine care delivered by a dental team as part of a comprehensive program to eliminate racial disparities in pediatric oral health. The proposed research (Oral Health Equity for Alaska, OHEAL) seeks to bridge the gap between research and practice by conducting a multi-level phase IV implementation study at the community, organization, provider, family and individual levels. The goal is to build on the existing system to design, implement and evaluate a series of dental care delivery system changes. The population of interest is 7,000 children, 2500 AIAN, living in communities served by the South East Alaska Regional Health Consortium (SEARHC). The intervention will result in a culturally competent, population-, risk- and evidence-based dental care delivery system. Case management, screening, risk assessment, preventive and caries arrest treatments will be delivered by Primary Dental Health Aides (PDHA) in alternative community settings, with seamless and timely referrals to Dental Health Aides Therapists (DHAT), as well as pediatric and primary care dentists at dental offices. Following the stages of the Active Implementation Framework, the study will use community-based participatory research with mixed-methods (interviews, focus groups, surveys and before and after controlled study). The specific aims are to (1) conduct a needs and capacity assessment of the communities and the dental care organization; (2) develop Native-specific culturally-appropriate processes and materials for the OHEAL implementation and (3) reinforce stakeholder support during UH2; (4) install; (5) implement; and (6) evaluate the OHEAL model in relation to adoption, fidelity, costs and impact on oral health, access and quality of dental care, racial/ethnic equity in oral health and racial/ethnic equity in dental care access and qualit during UH3. By tailoring evidence-based practices to the cultural and social reality of the AIAN children and the communities they live, SEARHC will be more efficient in improving the oral health of the communities and contribute to the reduction of racial disparities in oral health of children. This project is collaboration among University of Washington (UW) Pacific Northwest/Alaska Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities, UW Indigenous Wellness Research Institute, UW Partnerships for Native Health, DENTEX, and SEARHC.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to design, implement and evaluate a Native-specific culturally-competent, population-, risk-, evidence- and team-based dental care delivery system innovation to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in oral health and dental care among American Indian and Alaska Native children.            ",Oral Health Equity in Alaska (OHEAL): Implementation and Evaluation of Delivery System Changes to Reduce Oral Health Disparities for Native American Children,8984140,UH2DE025488,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Alaska ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Dental Care Delivery ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dental Offices ', ' dental personnel ', ' Dental Staff ', ' Dentists ', ' Family ', ' Fluorides ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Interview ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Pacific Northwest ', ' Patients ', ' Dental Sealants ', ' Pit and Fissure Sealants ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Solutions ', ' Supervision ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Case Management ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Native Americans ', ' Staging ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Ally ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preventive ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Indigenous ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' tribal Nation ', ' community living ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' anti-microbial ', ' antimicrobial ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' routine care ', ' health equity ', ' operation ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,UH2,2015,549921,0.2882522058596762
"Multi-Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in Primary Care Settings ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Northeast Ohio has one of the highest rates of untreated cavities among poor and minority <6 yr old children. While the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommend adoption of oral health assessment within the primary care setting for children up to 6 yrs old, the evidence for such activities have been poor or lacking. Primary care clinicians can play an important role in communicating oral health (OH) facts to parent/caregivers at well-child visits (WCV) to reduce disparities in dental care access. Childhood caries is multifactorial in origin, but evidence suggests that innovative theory-driven interventions have not targeted determinants at the child-parent, provider (physician), practice/organization levels. The intervention mapping framework was used to develop the multi-level interventions: Parent: improve perception and skills - a common-sense model of self-regulation (CSM)-based OH facts letter + dental information guide (DIG); Provider (Physician): improve knowledge and skills -CSM-based education and skills, communicate OH facts, provide prescription to go to dentist; Practice (Pediatric): quality improvement -integrate systematic EMR documentation of OH, practice-tailored facilitation. A cluster-randomized clinical trial with a hybrid design is proposed to test behavioral (parent, provider) and implementation (practice) intervention to increase dental attendance among low-income children. Twenty pediatric practices will be utilized for the following primary aims: 1) UH2, Conduct formative work through community engagement and pilot-testing of the interventions and protocols in 2 practices; UH3, randomize 18 practices to four arms to investigate: 2) effect of bundled (parent + provider + practice level) interventions vs. enhanced usual care; 3) effect of behavioral and implementation components of the intervention. Secondary aims (UH3) are: assess effectiveness of interventions on secondary outcomes (new decay, oral hygiene, OHRQL, frequency of sweet snacks and beverages, cost); assess potential mediators and moderators to investigate pathways; assess adoption, reach, fidelity, maintenance measures. The sample includes 88 providers and 1584 parent/caregivers (of Medicaid- enrolled 3-6 year old children). Data analysis (UH2) will utilize a mixed method design for qualitative and descriptive/analytical statistics for quantitative data resulting from focus groups, interviews, and pilot-testing. Data collection (UH3) will follow the RE-AIM framework: child (primary, secondary outcomes from dental screening/Medicaid claims); parent, provider, practice (mediators, moderators from questionnaires); provider, practice (fidelity and implementation measures from audits). Generalized linear mixed effects models will assess effects of multi-level interventions on dental attendance and other outcomes, while accounting for clustering within family, provider and practice. Secondarily, mediation methods, accompanied by sensitivity analyses, will determine if intervention effects occur through hypothesized mediators. A comprehensive and innovative scalable oral health care model is proposed for widespread use by front-line primary care clinicians.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will test innovative theory-driven multi-level interventions at the parent/caregiver, provider (physician), practice (pediatric) levels to increas dental attendance and reduce untreated caries among 3 to 6 year old Medicaid-enrolled children attending well-child visits in the pediatrician's offices. The behavioral interventions at the parent and provider levels, and implementation strategies at the practice level will help parent to seek dental care for child. These novel interventions have the potential for a new oral health care model for physicians providing care for young children.            ",Multi-Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities

"Addressing Oral Health Literacy among Mexican Immigrants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The fastest-growing and largest minority group in the United States, Latino immigrants accounted for 16% of the nation's population in 2010 and are projected to represent 30% by 2050.1,2 Latino children age 5 or under, and those of Mexican origin, in low-income families or in rural locations, have the highest rates of early childhood caries of any racial/ethnic groups, second only to Native Americans.3-7 Latinos have one of the lowest dental utilization rates of all ethnic/racial groups, with Mexican-Americans having the lowest utilization rate of all Latino groups.8-10 Maintaining oral health requires the ability to understand and act on health information and to navigate dental healthcare; in other words, an adequate level of Oral Health Literacy (OHL).11,12 Addressing OHL in Mexican immigrant families with appropriately framed education in contexts where they feel safe and respected, such as English as a Second Language (ESL) classes, is an emerging dental public health priority.13,14 ESL classes present an ideal environment to promote OHL to newly arrived immigrant parents and families at high risk for dental caries, particularly due to the well-established safe and trusting reputation of ESL classroom environments.16-18 Prior to developing OHL curriculum for use in ESL classes serving Latinos, it is first necessary to understand what exactly constitutes OHL in this population. What are current understandings of oral disease prevention, sources of and access to oral health information, experiences with and ability to use oral health information to access professional dental care, and understandings and perceptions of dental health services? We propose to conduct ethnographic research to investigate these questions which underpin oral health disparities among Mexican immigrant families. The proposed study is the first and vital formative stage of a research program focused on oral health disparities and OHL. It will provide the foundation for the development of appropriately framed core OHL curriculum aimed at assisting Mexican immigrants to better navigate the dental care system. We will evaluate foundational items of this curriculum in ESL classes in order to refine it for the next stage of research. The overall goal of the currently proposed formative study is to establish the foundation for an intervention to enhance dental system understanding and navigational (OHL) skills among Latino immigrant parents and families. The Specific Aims are to 1) Define the dimensions of OHL for SF Bay Area Mexican immigrants (i.e. conduct ethnographic research - observations, individual and group interviews - to describe experiences of oral health disparities, existing oral health understandings and system navigation); and 2) Develop foundational items for an OHL curriculum for delivery in ESL catchment areas and settings (present foundational items in ten (10) ESL classes serving Mexican immigrants; observe their engagement with these foundational aspects of a future curriculum and conduct 10 group interviews with adult ESL students for their views about each item). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study addresses priority areas in public health dentistry, will provide important data on oral health literacy (OHL) and oral health disparities, and will lay the foundation for a systems navigation OHL intervention for use in ESL classes.",Addressing Oral Health Literacy among Mexican Immigrants,8880180,R21DE024261,"['Testing ', ' tooth brushing ', ' Toothbrushing ', ' Toothpaste ', ' United States ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' base ', ' tooth brushes ', ' toothbrush ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Mexican ', ' Rural ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Immigrant ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' skills ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' outreach to information ', ' Access to Information ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' health literacy ', ' care systems ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Navigation System ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cultural Backgrounds ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dental Health Services ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Fluorides ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Mexico ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health Dentistry ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' San Francisco ', ' preschool ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Students ', ' ']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2015,237688,0.23244532429435916
"The representative microbiome: social determinants and tools for population research ﻿DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The structure and function of the vast array of microbial communities hosted by the human body (""microbiome"") is emerging as a novel contributor to variation in health outcomes. As links between the human microbiome and health emerge, population health approaches to understanding the social and environmental determinants of microbiome variation will be an important complement to microbiological and clinical research. Advances in massively parallel sequencing and computing now enable relatively low-cost characterization of the human microbiome in population-based studies. The Human Microbiome Project and MetaHIT project characterized the human microbiome among small groups of healthy volunteers, but neither of these projects used a representative population-based sample with a wide range of phenotypic variation, and the association of socioeconomic and demographic factors with microbiome composition is largely unknown. The human mouth harbors one of the most diverse microbial communities in the human body, which has been linked with both oral and systemic disease including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and pre-term birth. This study will establish the prevalence of oral microbiome characteristics and the associations of these characteristics with sociodemographic factors in a large, nationally representative sample from the 2009-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We will further examine the association of the oral microbiome with biomarkers of health risk that vary by SES and race/ethnicity including inflammation (C-reactive protein) and diabetes and pre-diabetes (fasting blood glucose and HbA1C%). Finally, the project will also build infrastructure for inter-disciplinary research in this emerging area by developing a publicly available, web- based interface and toolkit for population health researchers to easily incorporate microbiome data into their analysis. Understanding the social and life course determinants of the oral microbiome has the potential to lead to novel prevention strategies based upon environmental modification and manipulation of microbial ecology to reduce health disparities.

"Validating OCT and Raman spectroscopy for assessment of tooth de/remineralization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries continues to be prevalent in children and youth, with significant oral health disparities existing in some population groups. This disease arises when the balance between pathological factors (e.g. cariogenic bacteria) and protective factors (e.g. saliva flow) is tipped in favour of demineralization. The prevalence of caries suggests that the disease is not being effectively managed with an emphasis traditionally on restorative procedures where caries lesions are already serious. Dentistry is undergoing a paradigm shift away from surgical treatment of caries to a medical model of disease prevention and management. This change aims to address the disease cause with minimally invasive CAries Management By Risk Assessment (CAMBRA) efforts. For this paradigm to be successful, dentists need better tools to detect early lesions. Early detection will allow dentists to monitor and counsel patients in managing caries risk factors to help prevent disease progression. We hypothesize that the combination of morphological and biochemical information provided by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and polarized Raman spectroscopy (PRS), respectively, can provide clinicians with an improved tool to detect and assess early caries lesions as well as to be used for both short- and long-term monitoring for better caries management. The overall objective of this competitive renewal proposal is to develop a novel software and hardware clinical platform based on a combined OCT-PRS intra-oral probe for early dental caries detection and assessment. To achieve this goal we plan to: 1) establish a clinic-friendly software platform to derive caries relevant parameters from the OCT-PRS data, 2) develop combined OCT-PRS caries assessment intra-oral probes for proximal and occlusal surfaces, and finally 3) validate the hardware and software for clinical utility in caries detectio and assessment through two small scale clinical studies. Our research will provide novel automated software algorithms to provide clinicians with measures of caries presence, lesion extent, quantitative assessment of caries lesion activity and mineralization status during the examination of the patient. The proposed developments and evidence-based findings will support a paradigm shift in treating caries as a disease. This research supports the new US Healthy People 2020 program in which an oral health objective is to reduce caries and untreated decay among children and adolescents. Dental decay (dental caries) is preventable and curable, yet it is among the most common chronic diseases affecting children in the USA with significant oral health disparities existing in some population groups. The proposed research will provide clinicians with improved tools to detect and assess early dental caries for better caries management.

"Modeling childhood dental caries patterns for genomic and epigenetic analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries is the most common chronic disease in US children, and has actually increased in prevalence among young children in the last decade. Untreated childhood dental caries has a profound negative impact on quality of life, leading to many serious comorbidities, including chronic pain, tooth loss, difficulty hearing, eating, and sleeping, and failure to thrive, as well as poor school performance, social relationships, and self image, and decreased success later in life. In response to these negative health and social consequences, dental caries has become a focal issue in efforts to reduce public health disparities for both the NIDCR and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Treatment of dental caries consumes over $50 billion annually in dental health care costs; however, these expenditures are unfortunately concentrated in a caries management paradigm of surgical restoration (or extraction), which treats the symptoms of dental caries, while ignoring the root causes of disease. This approach disadvantages those with socioeconomic, geographic, or logistical barriers to accessing routine dental care. In order to shift the caries management paradigm to a model of risk assessment, early intervention, and recurrence prevention, the etiological factors controlling caries susceptibility will need to be identified. Our project seeksto fill this need, focusing on the genetic factors contributing to disease and applying innovative statistical methods of modeling dental caries experience. Indeed, studies shown that up to 60% of variation in caries experience may be attributed to host genetics; however, little is presently known about the specific genetic variants that contribute to cariogenesis, how these genes interact with environmental risk factors, and whether inherited epigenetic factors are also involved. This proposal will seek to fill the gap in knowledge regarding the environmental and genetic factors leading to childhood dental caries by modeling the patterns of caries across the dentition. We will conduct genome-wide association analysis utilizing two existing samples totaling 1,500 children aged 3 to 12 years with quality caries and risk factor assessments and available genotype data from a high-throughput microarray platform. We hypothesize that the effects exerted by risk factors lead to patterns of decay, which can be modeled, and in turn used for identifying and characterizing the environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors involved. Understanding the complex interplay between genetic and environmental contributors to dental caries may lead to never-before-considered targets for intervention, heralding the era of personalized medicine where dental caries management will be tailored to a patient's specific suite of genetic and environmental liabilities. The potential gains of this project are enormous and come at minimal costs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will provide much-needed understanding of the patterns, environmental risk factors, and genetic contributors of dental caries in children. Ultimately, understanding the factors contributing to dental caries may lead to improved risk assessment and novel targets for interventions, and may inform strategies for personalized management and

"Evaluating the Outcomes of Oral Health Workforce Policy to Increase Access to Dental Providers and Reduce Oral Health Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous states have passed expanded the dental workforce statues, allowing dental hygienists to deliver patient services to underserved children without direct supervision by a dentist. Outcomes and the cost of these policy changes in relation to eliminating oral health disparities in children are unknown. The objectives of this application are to 1) quantify the oral health and social outcomes relevant to the population of low-income, vulnerable children that are associated with expanding the dental workforce and, 2) undertake a cost analysis in a state where expanded dental hygiene workforce policy has demonstrated sustainability. For the U2 phase of this project we propose to complete three tasks: (1) Create and/or validate data collection instruments to measure relevant clinical, social and cost outcomes of children served by a statewide ECP program; (2) Establish collaborations with ECP programs (n=17) and school districts (n=108) to develop a statewide data collection strategy to evaluate clinical, social and cost outcomes of children served by a statewide ECP program; (3) Develop an appropriate curriculum to train ECP RDHs (n=41) as data collectors. For the UH3 phase of this project we propose to conduct a comprehensive, longitudinal, mixed methods policy outcomes evaluation on dentally underserved children (n=12,000). Three specific aims will accomplished during this phase: (1) Apply the multilevel Children's Oral Health Framework to identify the impact of the ECP workforce policy on children's primary and secondary oral health outcomes; (2) Conduct a cost analysis of oral health care provided by ECP RDHs; (3) Formulate evidence-based recommendations for developing dental workforce policy and delivery designs that can support oral health workforce changes, scope of practice changes, possible legislation and necessary infrastructure needed to achieve the Triple Aim. The proposed project is significant because it addresses a strategy to decrease oral health disparities in a population of low-income, largely minority children; it is innovative in its abiliy to leverage pre-existing relationships in a state with an existing oral health delivery system outside the structure of traditional private practice. The multi-disciplinary research team, assembled from academic, governmental, and practice settings, is well-positioned to successfully complete this research; expertise in dental workforce, community research, project evaluation, health policy, and cost analysis will allow us to address the core functions of the proposal. Results from the proposed research will be used to inform health policy and allow for rapid translation into oral health workforce practice, as well as advancing Goal 3 of NIDCRs Strategic Plan, ""Apply rigorous, multidisciplinary research approaches to overcome disparities in dental, oral and craniofacial health."" The varied contributions and perspectives of the multidisciplinary team will ensure results that can be applied to oral health policy. This contribution can be expected to help advance the field of health disparities research and the NIDCR's mission because findings would allow for rapid translation into oral health workforce practice and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to conduct a comprehensive outcomes evaluation of an existing, sustainable dental workforce policy that uses Extended Care Permit (ECP) dental hygienists to deliver oral health care to low income, minority, and rural-based children. Researchers in collaboration with the state Bureau of Oral Health and 41 ECP dental hygienists will use the ""Children's Oral Health"" conceptual model to examine changes in oral health status, oral health-related quality of life, and school attendance/performance in 12,000 dentally underserved children.

"A Prospective Investigation of the Oral Microbiome and Pancreatic Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer is a highly fatal disease (five-year survival rate of only 6%) with virtually no current opportunities for meaningful efforts towards primary or secondary prevention. It is the fourth most common cause of cancer death for both men and women in the US. African Americans are disproportionately burdened with the highest pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality rates in the US - about 30% higher than the group with the next highest rates, non-Hispanic whites. The current lack of knowledge on factors that could be useful for primary prevention or for identifying high-risk groups for potential screening or intervention is a major impediment to improving the poor outlook for this cancer. Evidence has been mounting, including pilot results generated for the current application, that commensal and pathogenic oral bacteria may play a role in pancreatic cancer development. If this is the case, and if the relevant characteristics of the oral microbiota can be identified, this could be a major breakthrough in our ability to prevent pancreatic cancer, because the oral ecology is modifiable. We see the emergence of new microbial gene sequencing and bioinformatics methods as a fundamental opportunity to study how oral microbial communities may contribute to pancreatic cancer risk and disparities. Leveraging the existing resources of two prospective, epidemiologic studies, the Southern Community Cohort Study and the Black Women's Health Study, we propose to substantially advance this emerging line of enquiry by conducting a comprehensive investigation of the oral microbiome and pancreatic cancer. We will do so within established parent cohorts that are uniquely situated to include African Americans (as well as European Americans) and to address potential racial differences in the oral microbiome as drivers of the excess burden of pancreatic cancer among African Americans. In a nested case-control study of 125 incident pancreatic cancer cases and 450 controls, using pre-diagnostic oral rinse samples, we will employ high-output genomic shotgun sequencing to characterize and compare the oral microbiome of cases and controls, hypothesizing that microbial abundance, diversity, and/or function will differ between these groups (Aim 1). Among the controls, we will also evaluate racial differences in the oral microbiome and identify any differences that may explain the increased incidence of pancreatic cancer among African Americans (Aim 2). We will further determine the association between recognized, modifiable risk factors for pancreatic cancer (cigarette smoking, obesity, red meat and processed meat consumption, alcohol consumption, type 2 diabetes) and oral microbiome attributes, and evaluate whether these exposures are associated with high-risk oral microbiome profiles (Aim 3). This study could have both immediate and long-term major impact by opening the doors for new mechanistic research as well as translational activities including manipulating the microbiome for cancer prevention, developing therapies related to the microbiome, and ultimately reducing the incidence of, and disparities in, pancreatic cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pancreatic cancer is a highly fatal disease with an enigmatic racial disparity and virtually no current opportunities for effective primary or secondary prevention efforts. The need for knowledge gains in these areas is thus profound. Prompted by mounting evidence that normal and pathogenic oral bacteria may play a role in pancreatic cancer development, the proposed investigation of the composition and function of the oral microbiome in relation to pancreatic cancer will provide some of the first prospective data addressing this novel question and could have immediate impact by spurring translational activities aimed at reducing the incidence of, and disparities in, pancreatic cancer.",A Prospective Investigation of the Oral Microbiome and Pancreatic Cancer,9140058,U01CA187508,"['Affect ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Antibodies ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Meat ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Nested Case-Control Study ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Chronic Periodontitis ', ' Periodontitis ', ' Play ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Tooth Loss ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' cancer prevention ', ' tool ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Oral ', ' microorganism ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' oral flora ', ' oral bacteria ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Controlled Study ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Shotgun Sequencing ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' microbiome ', ' Human Microbiome ', ' oral diagnostics ', ' total oral microbial community ', ' oral microbiome ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' microbial community ', ' modifiable risk ', ' Metagenomics ', ' Functional Metagenomics ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' high risk ', ' screening ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' microbiota ', ' Processed Meats ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,U01,2016,637483,0.19942398049840657
"Social Network Dynamics and Oral Health Disparities in Mexican American Immigrants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos in the US experience substantial oral health disparities (OHD). They face barriers to accessing oral health services (e.g., among the lowest rates of dental insurance among any racial or ethnic group), and are disproportionately less likely to seek regular and preventive dental care. Latino children and adults also experience higher rates of dental caries, gingivitis, and/or chronic periodontitis. Studies of oral health among Latinos have been limited to identifying individual-level socioeconomic and sociocultural mechanisms, with little attention to broader personal and community network contexts. Viewed from a network science perspective, the health behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes of individuals are shaped through contact and communication with others; there is a strong relationship between social networks and health outcomes. The current oral health research toolbox does not adequately capture the multiple nested levels of influence embodied in OHD. We propose to apply Social Network Analysis (SNA) methods to address the critical need to understand how social norms, attitudes, resources, and information around dental care and oral health propagate through personal and community networks, and affect individual behavior and outcomes. In the proposed research we will build on our completed formative project (NIDCR DE022096), a pioneer study using SNA methods in OHD research targeting people of Mexican descent (or Mexican-Americans [MAs]) in the US. In that prior cross-sectional design we characterized experiences about food, oral health behaviors, and dental care in the context of the networks they live in. Describing OHD factors and mechanisms affecting MAs has great public health significance because the MA sub-group makes up about 60% of Latinos in the US. In the present longitudinal design, we will develop a strong causal model of OHD by focusing on the dynamic processes underlying the coevolution of networks, oral health culture, and dental care attitudes and behaviors over time among MAs who have recently immigrated. Our specific aims are to: 1) characterize the norms, attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions of barriers around dental care and oral health among MA immigrants, with specific attention to associations between these factors and personal social network features; and 2) determine the relationships between acculturation, personal and community network dynamics, diffusion of norms and resources, and evolving oral health behaviors, attitudes, and outcomes over time among MA immigrants. Having additional, and more accurate knowledge about the complex and dynamic mechanisms underlying OHD will provide a foundation to develop four aspects: effective public policy, efficient clinical guidelines, culturally-sensitive clinical and preventive care, and futur research directions with practical applications. Moreover, drawing on the rich body of existing research on network interventions and diffusion of innovation from other health areas, our findings can be applied to tailoring programs that leverage the strengths and resources of MA communities to improve population oral health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Latino population - the largest and fastest growing ethnic group in the US - has significant barriers to dental services and is afflicted by large oral health disparities. Attempts to address such problems through individual behavior change have been largely unsuccessful because little is known about the complex network dimensions in which patterns of oral health self-care and dental services utilization take place. The proposed research will study one Latino community to trace relationships over time between acculturation, personal and community network dynamics, diffusion of norms and resources, and experiences of oral health, to yield a solid base for effective public policy and culturally-sensitive clinicalcare.        ",Social Network Dynamics and Oral Health Disparities in Mexican American Immigrants,9081086,R01DE025836,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' health attitude ', ' Attitude to Health ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Biology ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Diffusion ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Evolution ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gingivitis ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' dental health insurance ', ' Periodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontia insurance ', ' Oral Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Insurance ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Perception ', ' Chronic Periodontitis ', ' Periodontitis ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Assimilations ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Mexican ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Community Networks ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' social ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' service utilization ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' longitudinal design ', ' precision medicine ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' causal model ', ' causal diagram ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive dental care ', ' Preventive dental service ', ' Preventative dental service ', ' Preventative dental care ', ' ']",NIDCR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2016,707589,0.292608069445997
"Good Oral Health: a Bi-level Intervention to Improve Older Adult Oral Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application will extend a successful NIDCR-funded bi-level oral health self-management pilot conducted among older/disabled adults residing in one older adult residential building to six buildings and evaluate it using a modified fractional factorial design. The theoretical framework is based on Fishbein's modified theory of reasoned action called the Integrated Model (IM) of Behavioral Prediction. It is operationalized through Adapted Motivational Interviewing, an interactive tailored cognitive approach, and Practice-to-Mastery (AMI-PM). The intervention includes two components: 1) a face to face administration of the AMI-PM; and 2) a targeted building-level campaign that includes principles of practice to master (CA-PM). The specific aims are to: 1) Test the two main components of a bi-level intervention to improve clinical oral hygiene outcomes in relation to one another, and through differential sequencing. 2) Identify cognitive and behavioral mechanisms contributing to clinical oral hygiene outcomes. 3) Assess impact and sustainability of behavioral and clinical outcomes over time. The intervention will be carried out in three cycles of 150 participants each for a total of N=450. Each cycle will include two buildings matched by size and ethnic/linguistic composition housing older adults and those with disabilities. In one condition, the individual leve intervention will be introduced followed by the group level intervention. In the second condition, the group level intervention will precede the individual level. Survey and clinical measures taken at baseline, and following the administration of the first and second components. This design will enable comparison of the short term efficacy of the individual versus group level component (T1 - T2) and the shorter and longer term efficacy of the interventions (T3 - 3 months). Clinical measures at T4, 6 months later, will evaluate sustainability of effect. Primary outcome measures are gingival index and plaque score, both of which improved significantly in the pilot study. Significance lies in the potential of the intervention to address critical disparities in oral healh through oral health promotion initiatives in the locations where they reside as well as the ability to evaluate the intervention efficiently using a design alternative to the RCT. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study's primary significance lies in the potential of this bi-level intervention to address significant disparities in oral health and consequent morbidity or reduced quality of life among vulnerable, low-income and primarily minority older adults and those with disabilities through prevention in the locations where they reside.

"The representative microbiome: social determinants and tools for population research ﻿DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The structure and function of the vast array of microbial communities hosted by the human body (""microbiome"") is emerging as a novel contributor to variation in health outcomes. As links between the human microbiome and health emerge, population health approaches to understanding the social and environmental determinants of microbiome variation will be an important complement to microbiological and clinical research. Advances in massively parallel sequencing and computing now enable relatively low-cost characterization of the human microbiome in population-based studies. The Human Microbiome Project and MetaHIT project characterized the human microbiome among small groups of healthy volunteers, but neither of these projects used a representative population-based sample with a wide range of phenotypic variation, and the association of socioeconomic and demographic factors with microbiome composition is largely unknown. The human mouth harbors one of the most diverse microbial communities in the human body, which has been linked with both oral and systemic disease including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and pre-term birth. This study will establish the prevalence of oral microbiome characteristics and the associations of these characteristics with sociodemographic factors in a large, nationally representative sample from the 2009-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We will further examine the association of the oral microbiome with biomarkers of health risk that vary by SES and race/ethnicity including inflammation (C-reactive protein) and diabetes and pre-diabetes (fasting blood glucose and HbA1C%). Finally, the project will also build infrastructure for inter-disciplinary research in this emerging area by developing a publicly available, web- based interface and toolkit for population health researchers to easily incorporate microbiome data into their analysis. Understanding the social and life course determinants of the oral microbiome has the potential to lead to novel prevention strategies based upon environmental modification and manipulation of microbial ecology to reduce health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this study is to describe sociodemographic variation in the oral microbiome in a national population-based sample.

"Using Social Networks to Improve Oral Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Public housing development (PHD) residents typically lack the resources and information necessary to maintain good oral health. Children living in PHDs are at increased risk for oral health disparities as the social conditions are thought to hinder the flow of useful and actionable health information, and undermine exemplary health behavior practices. Current oral health research tools are insufficient to accurately characterize PHD resident interactions and to understand how the social relationships of caregivers may be effectively leveraged to improve their children's oral health. To date, disparities research has no adequately accounted for the heterogeneity of factors interacting in a web of influences nor permitted practical measurement of them. Network Science is ideally suited for investigating complex systems. Social networks have been conceived as key linking mechanisms characterizing interactions within a system. We will use Network Science methods to design and implement a network intervention, guided by the diffusion of innovations theory. The intervention will focus on both interactions between residents of PHDs, and the upstream influences operating within and among networks that affect more proximal pathways to health status. Our proposed multi-level intervention is aimed at producing individual, network and community-level outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that controlled dissemination of information targeting changes in health behaviors through social networks will accelerate the uptake of knowledge, support the adoption of positive behavior change, and improve oral health status of caregivers and their young children. During the formative UH2 phase, a multidisciplinary team of investigators will identify and characterize the structural properties of PHD members' networks that shape the flow of health information, resources and support. We will rely on community-based participatory research to maximally leverage our established, long-term links with community partners. In the UH3 phase, we will conduct an intervention to determine whether and how networks may be used to promote and accelerate health behavior changes. We will target caregivers of children ages 1-5 years, with 18-24 months' follow-up to ascertain the effectiveness of network activation through disseminated messages to acquiring knowledge and promoting behavior change with respect to healthy dietary choices, particularly reductions in sugar-sweetened beverage consumption. The research plan represents a major methodological improvement to the current state of the science as it addresses the complex systems' nature of oral health disparities. It will enhance our understanding of oral health disparities through bette characterization of the behaviors, social interactions (including interactions with health systems) and community features related to the information PHD residents utilize to make sense of, and act on, their health. Similar Network Science approaches in other fields have shown increased sustainability of behavior change over and above that of individualized efforts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although public housing is often known for demographics related to poor health, the social mechanisms giving rise to negative health outcomes are not well understood. We propose to study how residents of public housing interact in social networks to better explain how they use and spread knowledge about health and health behaviors and the impact these links have on dental health. The present study will focus on dental health behaviors, health information in general, and community resources among caregivers of young children living in public housing, to improve dental health.",Using Social Networks to Improve Oral Health,9146309,UH2DE025505,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Community Developments ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Knowledge acquisition ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Ego ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' Information Networks ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Methods ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Housing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Social Network ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Measurement ', ' Community Health Systems ', ' uptake ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Community Networks ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' knowledge resources ', ' knowledge resource ', ' information resource ', ' Information Resources ', ' Intake ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Personal Conduct ', ' Personal Behavior ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Consumption ', ' 5 year old ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Health behavior change ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' demographics ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community setting ', ' social health determinants ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' ']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,UH2,2016,843607,0.22412302176780297
"A Tailored Approach to Reducing Oral Health Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The efficacy of dental treatments often varies according to patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity). These variations are called heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTEs). Understanding how patient characteristics interact with treatment is key to improving treatment decisions for individual patients and for developing targeted treatments to reduce oral health disparities. However, studies that purport to show HTEs include numerous examples of misleading claims that have been later overturned (e.g., the lack of effectiveness of antihypertensive treatment in elderly patients has been refuted). Unfortunately, we lack the design and analysis strategies that can identify and confirm patient characteristics that cause HTEs. Our long-term goal is to develop HTE analytic strategies that can be used to personalize disease management and treatment, including preventive treatments. In pursuit of that goal, our primary aim is to develop an HTE framework that can identify a panel of patient characteristics that cause HTEs. Compared to traditional exploratory HTE methods, our new framework will identify complex interactions among patient characteristics. Our second aim is to demonstrate how the framework can be used to identify and confirm a panel of patient characteristics that cause HTEs in two NIDCR-funded caries prevention trials. Finally, our third aim is to develop freely available software to provide researchers with the needed tools to apply this framework to all dental trials. The proposed research is significant because it will provide dental researchers with the analytic tools they need to rigorously and effectively identify and confirm a panel of patient characteristics that cause HTEs. This study is aligned with the NIDCR's 2014-2019 strategic plan (Goal II) to enable precise and personalized oral healthcare through research and the National Research Council's endorsement of the emerging field of precision health. This project will also be highly time and cost effective because it will leverage the resources of two existing RCTs, an efficient use of current NIDCR studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients and dentists often make treatment decisions based on data representing the average (or overall) study results. This decision assumes that the average study population represents an individual patient even though a ""real"" patient is likely different from the average patient, in terms of demographic or health behavior characteristics, known as heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTEs). This new strategy to identify patient characteristic that cause HTEs, proposed in this study, is aligned with NIDCR's 2014-2019 goal to enable precise and personalized oral health-care through research. NIDCR is committed to being at the leading edge of this development to embrace personalized, precision healthcare. A first step toward developing effective and personalized disease-management is improving the analytic strategies that can be used to identify and confirm HTEs, as proposed in this study.",A Tailored Approach to Reducing Oral Health Disparities,9025776,R03DE024262,"['Age ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' Aspirin ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Dentists ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Literature ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' National Research Council ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Patients ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Dental ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' tool ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' simulation ', ' Documentation ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' prevent stroke ', ' Stroke prevention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Clinical Trials Database ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' treatment effect ', ' comparative ', ' computer generated ', ' Prevention trial ', ' personalized approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individual patient ', ' personalized management ', ' precision management ', ' personalized disease management ', ' personalized clinical management ', ' individualized management ', ' study population ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' ']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2016,158500,0.20965213503991093
"Multi-Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in Primary Care Settings ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Northeast Ohio has one of the highest rates of untreated cavities among poor and minority <6 yr old children. While the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommend adoption of oral health assessment within the primary care setting for children up to 6 yrs old, the evidence for such activities have been poor or lacking. Primary care clinicians can play an important role in communicating oral health (OH) facts to parent/caregivers at well-child visits (WCV) to reduce disparities in dental care access. Childhood caries is multifactorial in origin, but evidence suggests that innovative theory-driven interventions have not targeted determinants at the child-parent, provider (physician), practice/organization levels. The intervention mapping framework was used to develop the multi-level interventions: Parent: improve perception and skills - a common-sense model of self-regulation (CSM)-based OH facts letter + dental information guide (DIG); Provider (Physician): improve knowledge and skills -CSM-based education and skills, communicate OH facts, provide prescription to go to dentist; Practice (Pediatric): quality improvement -integrate systematic EMR documentation of OH, practice-tailored facilitation. A cluster-randomized clinical trial with a hybrid design is proposed to test behavioral (parent, provider) and implementation (practice) intervention to increase dental attendance among low-income children. Twenty pediatric practices will be utilized for the following primary aims: 1) UH2, Conduct formative work through community engagement and pilot-testing of the interventions and protocols in 2 practices; UH3, randomize 18 practices to four arms to investigate: 2) effect of bundled (parent + provider + practice level) interventions vs. enhanced usual care; 3) effect of behavioral and implementation components of the intervention. Secondary aims (UH3) are: assess effectiveness of interventions on secondary outcomes (new decay, oral hygiene, OHRQL, frequency of sweet snacks and beverages, cost); assess potential mediators and moderators to investigate pathways; assess adoption, reach, fidelity, maintenance measures. The sample includes 88 providers and 1584 parent/caregivers (of Medicaid- enrolled 3-6 year old children). Data analysis (UH2) will utilize a mixed method design for qualitative and descriptive/analytical statistics for quantitative data resulting from focus groups, interviews, and pilot-testing. Data collection (UH3) will follow the RE-AIM framework: child (primary, secondary outcomes from dental screening/Medicaid claims); parent, provider, practice (mediators, moderators from questionnaires); provider, practice (fidelity and implementation measures from audits). Generalized linear mixed effects models will assess effects of multi-level interventions on dental attendance and other outcomes, while accounting for clustering within family, provider and practice. Secondarily, mediation methods, accompanied by sensitivity analyses, will determine if intervention effects occur through hypothesized mediators. A comprehensive and innovative scalable oral health care model is proposed for widespread use by front-line primary care clinicians. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will test innovative theory-driven multi-level interventions at the parent/caregiver, provider (physician), practice (pediatric) levels to increas dental attendance and reduce untreated caries among 3 to 6 year old Medicaid-enrolled children attending well-child visits in the pediatrician's offices. The behavioral interventions at the parent and provider levels, and implementation strategies at the practice level will help parent to seek dental care for child. These novel interventions have the potential for a new oral health care model for physicians providing care for young children.",Multi-Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in Primary Care

"Oral Health Equity in Alaska (OHEAL): Implementation and Evaluation of Delivery System Changes to Reduce Oral Health Disparities for Native American Children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) children are particularly affected by disparities in oral health: AIAN children have double the caries experience of white children and 2 to 3 times higher rates of untreated caries. Despite great resilience in tribal nations, geographical isolation, dentist shortages, and community mistrust on health care systems exacerbate the inequity. In Alaska, Dental Health Aides, drawn from indigenous communities, are available to provide preventive and interim care and to serve as patient navigators so that children receive curative care. Disparities could be reduced if the dental care delivery system, including the community-based allied dental personnel, were more effective. However, no studies have yet evaluated the incorporation of evidence-based dental treatments into routine care delivered by a dental team as part of a comprehensive program to eliminate racial disparities in pediatric oral health. The proposed research (Oral Health Equity for Alaska, OHEAL) seeks to bridge the gap between research and practice by conducting a multi-level phase IV implementation study at the community, organization, provider, family and individual levels. The goal is to build on the existing system to design, implement and evaluate a series of dental care delivery system changes. The population of interest is 7,000 children, 2500 AIAN, living in communities served by the South East Alaska Regional Health Consortium (SEARHC). The intervention will result in a culturally competent, population-, risk- and evidence-based dental care delivery system. Case management, screening, risk assessment, preventive and caries arrest treatments will be delivered by Primary Dental Health Aides (PDHA) in alternative community settings, with seamless and timely referrals to Dental Health Aides Therapists (DHAT), as well as pediatric and primary care dentists at dental offices. Following the stages of the Active Implementation Framework, the study will use community-based participatory research with mixed-methods (interviews, focus groups, surveys and before and after controlled study). The specific aims are to (1) conduct a needs and capacity assessment of the communities and the dental care organization; (2) develop Native-specific culturally-appropriate processes and materials for the OHEAL implementation and (3) reinforce stakeholder support during UH2; (4) install; (5) implement; and (6) evaluate the OHEAL model in relation to adoption, fidelity, costs and impact on oral health, access and quality of dental care, racial/ethnic equity in oral health and racial/ethnic equity in dental care access and qualit during UH3. By tailoring evidence-based practices to the cultural and social reality of the AIAN children and the communities they live, SEARHC will be more efficient in improving the oral health of the communities and contribute to the reduction of racial disparities in oral health of children.

"Center for the Biologic Basis of Oral/Systemic Diseases (Phase III) Systemic Diseases (CBBO/SD)"" is to continue sustainability of a nationally competitive transdisciplinary research center focusing on oral health sciences and systemic diseases within the University of Kentucky. This proposal builds upon the Phase I/II funding for developing the research infrastructure in the College of Dentistry and supporting junior investigators to develop competitive research programs using this infrastructure. The CBBO/SD represents the concrete realization of the Specific Aims of the Phase I/II funding that was designed to: (i) expand the critical mass of funded investigators at UK in the areas of oral and systemic health research; (ii) create and enhance cutting-edge scientific core resources that can continue to serve as platforms to increase the competitiveness of existing research faculty, as well as for recruiting new faculty; and (iii) implement the range of infrastructure improvements in the research enterprise to successfully transition the COBRE funding into long-term competitive, renewable support from a diverse array of federal and non-federal sources. The UKCD created a position for an Associate Dean for Research, and a Center for Oral Health Research (COHR) housed in the college to develop and oversee a broad range of basic and applied research beginning in 2000. This was followed by events that created a vibrant environment for implementation of the CBBO/SD in 2003 with an explicit goal of developing a center conducting research on oral and systemic health and housed in the College of Dentistry. The CBBO/SD provides a strong thematic research focus and unique resources, along with research training of graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty mentoring. From the outset this was accomplished in a collaborative framework that emphasized mentoring, scientific advancement, academic career development, competitive grantsmanship, and productivity. The Phase III proposal incorporates 4 interactive cores: Adminstrative/Educational Core, Delta Dental of Kentucky Clinical Research Center (DDKCRC) Core; Core Translational Diagnostics Laboratory (CTDL); and Oral Health Pilot Program (OI-IPP) core. The CBBO/SD Phase ill objectives are to: (1) focus efforts and resources towards creating a sustainable university-wide research center with unique clinical and translational scientific cores providing interdisciplinary research interactions in oral and general health investigations, (2) continue to identify, Stimulate and nurture investigators at the University of Kentucky to ascertain and pursue important questions related to diseases of the oral and craniofacial complex, and (3) enhance the expansion of collaborative research programs by supplying structure and expertise in specialized core facilities supporting these research initiatives. The major research theme of the CBBO/SD generally remains similar to those throughout the Phase I/II tenure of the center. This focused on chronic inflammatory diseases with infections and dysregulated host responses linking oral and systemic health. The CBBO/SD has a parallel goal in providing the fundamental basis for the research enterprise in the UK College of Dentistry (UKCD) to actively participate in the national clinical and translation research environment with a focus of moving clinical findings into improving health of the population with enhanced implementation of new clinical findings. As the flagship land-grant University of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the UKCD has a major role in helping to solve the massive health care needs of the Appalachian population inhabiting 54 counties in Kentucky by addressing multigenerational oral and general health disparities in Appalachian Kentucky. This will require effective interprofessional education, collaborative research initiatives, and emphasizing external funding from a wide array of NIH institutes, other federal agencies, and independent private and public funding sources. The Strategic Objectives of the Phase 111 aspect of the center include: understand the molecular mechanisms underlying periodontal disease; foster collaborations enabling definition of the biologic mechanisms linking periodontal disease with systemic disease(s); support collaborative efforts across the UK campus to engage additional research teams into the offering of the Genetics/Genomics services and the Mineralized Tissue services; and, continue the research relationship with the Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences at UK to implement community-based initiatives to reduce oral disease burden. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The COBRE core infrastructure will focus on supporting clinical and translational research that impacts health of the oral cavity and the individual. The substantially poor oral health metrics of the population of Kentucky, particularly rural populations, needs to be addressed with new science and new models to deliver improved health for future generations.            ",Center for the Biologic Basis of Oral/Systemic Diseases (Phase III),9120909,P30GM110788,"['Kentucky ', ' designing ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' Center of Biomedical Research Excellence ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' Infrastructure ', ' COBRE ', ' Funding Source ', ' Basic Research ', ' Applied Science ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' disparity in health ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Position ', ' graduate student ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' base ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' Funding ', ' Source ', ' improved ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immune response ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' collegiate ', ' Genetic ', ' Funding Agency ', ' Basic Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' Parodontosis ', ' periodontal disorder ', ' periodontium disease ', ' periodontium disorder ', ' Fostering ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Investigation ', ' Genomics ', ' Area ', ' Event ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Oral ', ' Systemic disease ', ' Structure ', ' programs ', ' health disparity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Dental ', ' Inflammatory ', ' health care ', ' Individual ', ' Future Generations ', ' Link ', ' Diagnostic ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' mouth disorder ', ' dental health ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Resources ', ' social role ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Mouth ', ' Centers of Research Excellence ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' active recruitment ', ' recruit ', ' Population ', ' Investigators ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Core Facility ', ' Molecular ', ' burden of illness ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Health Sciences ', ' design ', ' Address ', ' faculty mentor ', ' faculty research ', ' Disorder ', ' Infection ', ' craniofacial complex ', ' Institutes ', ' Role ', ' Translational Research ', ' Rural Population ', ' Educational aspects ', ' population health ', ' Housing ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Science ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Universities ', ' Disease ', ' Faculty ', ' Communities ', ' County ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare ', ' Goals ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' Grant ', ' Education ', ' Oral health ', ' Productivity ', ' Environment ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Mentors ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Periodontal Diseases ', ' Dentistry ', ' Tissues ', ' Laboratories ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,P30,2016,1223804,0.17162705575436543
"Predicting Caries Risk in Underserved Toddlers in Primary Healthcare Settings DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dental caries, the most common chronic disease of childhood, is a largely preventable disease. This proposal focuses on addressing inequities in dental caries experience among preschool aged U.S. children. It has been inspired by the shift and increase in dental caries among subsets of the population (i.e., 2-5 year old children, especially from underserved/minority population groups) that calls for a greater focus on targeted healthcare. In an environment of increasing healthcare costs and resource constraints, this approach is paramount in addressing oral health disparities. Because children have multiple well-child pediatric visits in the early years of life, many lower socioeconomic status (SES) and minority children have much greater access to medical care than to dental care. Our long-term goal is to reduce disparities in dental caries experience in young children in the U.S. by developing effective risk-based caries preventive and therapeutic strategies to be delivered through new models for oral health care, including primary medical healthcare settings. However, the problem is that currently there is no practical, validated and easily-scored tool practitioners can use to accurately and reliably assess, and effectively triage children at the highest risk for caries. Such an urgently needed tool will be developed in this proposed research. Thus, the objective of this study is to validate a caries risk questionnaire in order to develop a practical and easily-scored caries risk tool for use in primary medical healthcare settings to identify young, diverse U.S. children (1-4 years of age) with the highest risk for the development of caries. This will be accomplished by having the parents of 1,326 infants complete a caries risk questionnaire and by performing caries examinations on the children at baseline (child's age 12 + 3 months old), and again at 18 months (child's age 30 + 3 months) and 36 months after the baseline (child's age 48 + 3 months) to monitor the caries disease process, and how well the risk tool predicts caries risk status as the child ages. A great strength of this proposal is that it involves four experienced investigator groups who offer strong partnerships between medical and dental teams, and three study sites with well established primary care medical research networks that provide access and facilitate follow up to a variety of at-risk, diverse populations, including ethnic and racial minorities and low SES groups. Each study site also has an NIH Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA), and will benefit from infrastructure and experience in longitudinal clinical translational research. The significance of this work is that identification of high caries risk children in primary healthcare settings allows cost-effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed, targeted and used in these settings to prevent early childhood caries. This will have immediate broad impact and influence on existing dental and medical policies and programs regarding screening and prevention of dental caries among young children from diverse disadvantaged and underserved subgroups, in primary medical and dental pediatric healthcare settings. The relevance of this collaborative, innovative and high impact project between physicians and dentists is that it will result in a valid, reliable, and practical (easy to score) caries risk assessment tool for the identification of high caries risk infants/toddlers in primary medical healthcare settings allowing for cost effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed and targeted to prevent early childhood caries, and help reduce disparities in caries experience.",Predicting Caries Risk in Underserved Toddlers in Primary Healthcare Settings,9121458,U01DE021412,"['Academy ', ' Age ', ' Award ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dentists ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Dyes ', ' Environment ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Goals ', ' Indiana ', ' Infant ', ' Iowa ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' North Carolina ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Pedodontics ', ' Pediatric Dentistry ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Testing ', ' Triage ', ' Universities ', ' Wit ', ' Work ', ' Medical Research ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Lesion ', ' Dental ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Discipline ', ' pediatrician ', ' Policies ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' Expert Opinion ', ' Toddler ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Population Group ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Pediatric Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' practice-based research network ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 4 year old ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' 5 year old ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' high risk ', ' primary care setting ', ' screening ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' underserved minority ', ' minority children ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2016,2365443,0.18849124189641497
"Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries is a very different disease than it was forty years ago. While caries is declining in general, caries rates in young children (ages 2-5) in the US have been increasing (US GAO, 2008). There is also increasing disparity seen with severe caries occurring disproportionately in the poor and disenfranchised. Notably, individuals living in selected areas of Appalachia have some of the worst oral health indicators in the U.S. The current proposal is a renewal of our ongoing project (R01-DE-014899) to identify factors contributing to the oral health disparity seen in northern Appalachia versus the rest of the nation. The guiding philosophy of our project has been and continues to be that developing strategies to address this disparity requires simultaneous study of multiple risk components (ideally within families) to determine their roles, interactions among them, and their transmissibility patterns. The long-term goal of our program of research is to determine why the Northern Appalachian population is at increased risk of oral disease so that targeted preventive interventions can be designed.  One of the most notable results from the first project period was that the disparity in dental caries is evident at an early age; the prevalence of total caries experience in 2 - 5 year olds from our Northern Appalachian study was 144% of the prevalence of comparable children in NHANES, with this disparity diminishing in later age groups. Importantly, we also identified genes in multiple categories (tooth structure, taste preference, and salivary proteins) that are associated with either increased caries risk or protection, sometimes showing different effects in different age groups and/or dentitions. Finally, our microbiological and genetic studies of S. mutans demonstrated extreme genetic diversity and showed that S. mutans alone is unlikely to be the sole caries risk factor; more likely, dynamic changes in the oral microbial ecology are responsible for elevated disease risk. Based on the cross-sectional results, we hypothesize that the mechanisms that lead to disparities develop within the first two years of life. Implicit in this hypothesis is the need to address these questions longitudinally among children before and during the time of greatest risk from three different perspectives:  psychosocial, genetic, and microbiological.  The aims of this renewal include development of a longitudinal study of dental caries development early in life by recruiting a cohort of pregnant women. We will then utilize both the data collected in the first project period, and new data from the longitudinal cohort to follow up the significant environmental, genetic and microbial results from the first project period. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite years of study and preventive dentistry, dental caries in young children has been markedly increasing. The goal of this study is to continue our program of studying oral health in Appalachia, in particular to investigate factors (behavioral, genetic and microbial) leading to the early development of dental caries.",Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia,9235636,R01DE014899,"['Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dentition ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' behavior genetics ', ' Genetic Determinants of Behavior ', ' Behavioral Genetics ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Control Locus ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Maps ', ' Microbiology ', ' Mothers ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Philosophy ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Preventive Dentistries ', ' Preventive Dentistry ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Salivary Gland Proteins ', ' Salivary Proteins ', ' S.mutans ', ' S. mutans ', ' Streptococcus mutans ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gender ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Individual ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Genetic ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Oral ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' meetings ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' microbial interaction ', ' microorganism interaction ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Taxon ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' SNP genotyping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' 5 year old ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' Microbial Genetics ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Taste preferences ', ' Genetic study ', ' Age ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,1010443,0.2556356282129186
"Howard University Summer Research Experience Program in Oral Health Disparity for Underrepresented Racial and Ethnic Students ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How Racial disparity in oral health has been well documented for several decades. However, the disparity persists, particularly between African Americans and other ethnic groups, despite advances in diagnosis and treatment. Increasing diversity in oral health research and care workforce is an effective strategy to improve the Nation's capacity to address and eliminate oral health disparities. In this project, we propose a full-time eight-week summer research experience program (SREP) at Howard University, aiming at engaging, recruiting and training undergraduate students from underrepresented minority and other disparity populations into minority health care and oral health disparity research. This SREP is designed to be a specialized didactic and mentored academic program with a series of formal and informal research and education activities tailored for recruiting and training undergraduate students.  To provide effective mentoring for the students, we will: 1) develop a highly networked team of motivated and skilled mentors from various disciplines through the strong partnership between Howard and Johns Hopkins Universities; and 2) develop an effective and sustainable research training and education infrastructure by establishing a 3-tiered Mentoring System, Committees of Execution and Advising, and an Evaluation Core. The 3-tiered Mentoring System is specifically designed for mentoring each participating undergraduate by a primary mentor with basic, translational or public research focus at Howard, a secondary senior mentor at Johns Hopkins and other institutes, and a career development advisory mentor from oral health professionals.  The SREP is also designed to be an extension for two existing training programs at Howard University College of Dentistry: the NIH funded P20 program for training dental school students and faculty, and the HRSA funded Post-doctoral Training Program in Pediatric Dentistry (PTPD). Different from the two programs, the proposed SREP emphasizes on providing research experience for underrepresented undergraduates in oral health disparity. This program, combined with the P20 and PTPD programs, will bring together Howard students from diverse backgrounds and interests to create a rich mix of participants from across disciplinary backgrounds.  Through the SREP, we will be able to provide summer research training for five highly qualified students every year over the 5-year funding period (a total of 25 students). By participating in multi-disciplinary research projects and education events of senior investigators who will serve as mentors and role models, the students will gain valuable research experience and knowledge in oral health, and promote them into advanced education in oral health. Successful completion of this program will have significantly impacted the dental, oral and craniofacial research and training environment at Howard University College of Dentistry.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a full-time eight-week summer research experience program at Howard University, aiming at engaging, recruiting and training undergraduate students from underrepresented minority and other disparity populations into minority health care and oral health disparity research.

"Sensory Adapted Dental Environments to Enhance Oral Care for Children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, which builds upon our previous R34 NIDCR Planning and Feasibility study, is designed to examine the efficacy of a sensory adapted dental environment (SADE) to enhance children's oral care. Two groups will be studied: children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and typically developing (TD) children. Children with ASD, and a subset of TD children, exhibit sensory over-responsivity when confronted with experiential aspects of dental visits such as exposure to bright fluorescent lighting, touch in or around the mouth, or the texture and smell of various oral care products. This often results in increased anxiety and negative behavioral responses, which hinder the dentist's ability to perform treatment. In the proposed project, we test a SADE intervention designed to reduce children's anxiety and negative responses during oral care. The SADE intervention includes adaptations such as dimmed lighting, moving projections on the ceiling (fish, bubbles), exposure to soothing music, and application of a butterfly vest with wings that wrap around the child to provide calming sensations.  The specific aims are to conduct a randomized clinical trial in order to: 1. Determine if SADE, relative to a regular dental environment (RDE), reduces physiological anxiety and negative responses (behavioral distress, perception of pain, sensory discomfort) during dental cleaning for children with ASD and TD children and test whether SADE's effect is greater for the ASD group. 2. Identify whether physiological anxiety mediates the beneficial effects of the intervention and whether severity of ASD and communication ability (ASD group), or dental anxiety, sensory over-responsivity, and age (both groups) act as moderating variables. 3. Assess the quality of care and cost effectiveness/savings of the dental cleaning associated with SADE.  Research participants will be 220 ethnically diverse children aged 6-12 years, 110 with ASD and 110 TD. Using a randomized counterbalanced study design, each child will undergo two dental cleanings four months apart: one dental cleaning in RDE and one dental cleaning in SADE.  This project is significant because it is the first full-scale trial of an intervention designed to reduce oral care problems in children with ASD. It is theoretically important because it will elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the effects of the SADE intervention and help to identify which subgroups of children, both TD and with ASD, which will benefit most from this approach. Based on the study findings, we will develop a model to transform the standard of pediatric dental care by modifying the sensory qualities of the dental environment; this model will have the potential to be utilized in dental clinics worldwide. As such the project promises to have a major public health impact insofar as the potential gains in oral health, child comfort, and cost-savings will be dramatic, potentially applying to more than one-fourth of all children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), as well as many typically developing children, exhibit sensory over-responsivity in response to the bright lights, sounds, and touch at the dental office, making dental care challenging for such populations. In this study we will test an intervention that alters the sensory characteristics of he dental environment in order to decrease children's physiological anxiety and negative responses during oral care and contribute to increased child comfort as well as safer, more efficient, and less costly treatment. If successful, this intervention has the potential to revolutionize clinic-based dental care for the growing population of children with ASD, as well as for typically developing children with dental anxiety and/or sensory over-responsivity.",Sensory Adapted Dental Environments to Enhance Oral Care for Children,9059069,U01DE024978,"['Age ', ' General Anesthesia ', ' Anxiety ', ' Butterflies ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Clinics ', ' Dental Offices ', ' Dentists ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fishes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Illumination ', ' Lighting ', ' Music ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Perception ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Savings ', ' Sensation ', ' Esthesia ', ' Smell ', ' Olfaction ', ' Smell Perception ', ' sound ', ' taste response ', ' taste processing ', ' gustatory response ', ' gustatory processing ', ' gustatory perception ', ' Taste ', ' Gustation ', ' Taste Perception ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Wing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dental Anxiety ', ' Odontophobia ', ' Dental Phobia ', ' Dental Fear ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Dental ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Visual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Cross-Over Designs ', ' Crossover Design ', ' Exposure to ', ' sedation ', ' Sedation procedure ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Tactile ', ' Auditory ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Reaction ', ' Sensory ', ' Texture ', ' Visit ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Cooperative Agreements ', ' U-Series Cooperative Agreements ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' oral care ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' successful intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2016,919705,0.1820503375774249
"Integrating Interactive Parent Text Messaging and Oral Health Guidelines into Pediatric Community Health Centers to Reduce Early Childhood Caries ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to RFA-DE-15-006 ""Multidisciplinary and Collaborative Research Consortium to Reduce Oral Health Disparities in Children: A Multi-level Approach."" The prevalence of Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is increasing, disproportionately affecting racial and ethnic minorities (Dye, 2007). Prevention efforts for high risk groups require multi-level strategies. We will target parents/legal guardians of children (<6 years) during pediatric well-child visits at urban community health centers (CHCs), and provide a text-message based ECC prevention intervention. We will also target the pediatric providers in the CHCs to adopt oral health guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and also improve documentation within their Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Thus, our multi-level intervention includes children, parents, providers and the CHC system. 85% of adults use text messaging, with no disparities by race/ethnicity, education or income. The benefits of text message interventions include the use anywhere/anytime, low cost, scalability to large populations, ability to tailor message content and intensity, and provision of strategies in real time. CHCs are an ideal venue for oral health promotion both at an individual level (they provide care to the groups at highest risk for ECC) and at a population level (there are 90 CHCs electronically linked locally and >1,100 CHCs nationally). In Phase 1 (UH2), we will conduct focus groups and interviews with parents and CHC providers to inform the development of the oral health text message intervention, as well as assess CHC work flow to identify sustainable strategies for oral health integration and eventual dissemination. This formative work is vital to ensure cultural and environmental compatibility, as we have done previously. The text messages will be consistent with AAP guidelines, our theoretical model (Social Cognitive Theory), and our previous work. We will use the Fisher-Owens Model (2007) as an intervention planning framework. In Phase 2 (UH3), 850 parents/legal guardians of children <6 years attending our target CHCs will be randomized to receive one of two dose-equivalent text message interventions: Oral Health Texts (OHT) or Child Wellness Texts (CWT). The primary outcome variable will be ECC incidence at 24 months. We will assess mediators and moderators of the intervention effect, perform a budget impact analysis to determine the financial consequences of adoption, diffusion, and sustainability of the OHT intervention at CHCs, assess CHC changes in oral health promotion (provider practices and EHR documentation), and assess changes in both pediatric and parent oral health behaviors. This research has strong potential to be an evidence based program that could easily be adopted at low cost and low provider burden in the 1,128 CHCs in the U.S. that treat almost 4.5 million high risk children <6 years old. Our text message intervention is innovative because involves system-generated real time support, tailoring, feedback, and interactivity. Our study has theoretical significance because it integrates a testable theory with an intervention planning model to elucidate mechanisms of change at multiple levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Despite the fact that early childhood caries (ECC) is preventable, it is the most common chronic childhood disease in the US, affecting 28% of those aged 2-5, and disproportionately affecting poor and minority groups. We propose an interactive text messaging intervention delivered to parents of children younger than 6 years old, which aims to foster healthy parent behaviors and reduce ECC in their children. This novel, low cost approach has the potential to expand the ability of community health center (CHC) pediatric clinics to efficiently integrate oral health promotion into their practice and could easily be disseminated to the 1200 CHCs in the United States that treat 4.5 million children younger than 6, most of whom are at high risk for ECC.",Integrating Interactive Parent Text Messaging and Oral Health Guidelines into Pediatric Community Health Centers to Reduce Early Childhood Caries,9146324,UH2DE025492,"['Academy ', ' Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Budgets ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Dyes ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Feedback ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Fluorides ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' Legal Guardians ', ' Lip ', ' Lip structure ', ' literacy ', ' Maps ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Parents ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Testing ', ' fabric ', ' Textiles ', ' Time ', ' tooth brushing ', ' Toothbrushing ', ' Toothpaste ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Lifting ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Oral ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 6 year old ', ' six year old ', ' age 6 years ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Evidence based program ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Cultural Sensitivity ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,UH2,2016,787340,0.25746069700629615
"Learning about Early Childhood Caries Prevention in a Latino Population: A Multilevel Approach ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed K99/R00 career development award application will support academic preparation and the initiation of an independent research career focused on multilevel factors associated with oral health using a strengths-based approach to reduce pediatric oral health disparities. The oral health of a child cannot be separated from family, community and the environment; thus it is vital to include a multilevel perspective in any comprehensive model of children's oral health. My research in the K99 phase will describe the maternal psychosocial and behavioral factors associated with ECC and also will describe the prevalence of dental caries in a sample of Latino children. Measures taken from the Basic Research Factors Questionnaire (BRFQ) will be used to describe psychosocial and behavioral factors (e.g., oral health locus of control, health beliefs, self- efficacy, Sense o Coherence, stress, importance of oral health, oral health knowledge and behaviors) in Latina mothers of preschool children in Denver, Colorado. The results of this study will be compared to that of a high-risk American Indian population in which similar measures from the BRFQ were used. During the R00 phase, a mixed methods approach will be used to describe the differences at child, family and community levels for caries-free and caries-active urban dwelling Latino children. This methodology will capture the factors measured by the BRFQ survey and then will use qualitative methods to further probe characteristics at each level. I will use asset mapping, which is one on the strengths-based approaches, to describe the protective health assets that enhance the ability of individuals, families, communities and social systems to maintain and sustain oral health and to help reduce oral health inequities in high risk and vulnerable groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research and training has three-fold relevance for public health. First, the award will promote to mentor and nurture a new investigator, who has a background in dentistry and public health and is committed to reducing oral health disparities in the United States. Second, this project will use a multidisciplinary and multi-method approach to describe the protective factors against early childhood caries in Latino children at individual, family and community level. Through this research we will be able to understand why some children, despite being at high risk for developing dental caries, remain caries-free. This will not only add essential and indispensable information to the literature but will guide other investigators in their research. Finally, this research will develop a conceptual outline for behavioral interventions based on the principles of strength based approaches in a community rather than based on pathological model.",Learning about Early Childhood Caries Prevention in a Latino Population: A Multilevel Approach,9099823,K99DE024758,"['American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Award ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' Preschool Child ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dentists ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environment and Public Health ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Control Locus ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mothers ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Parents ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health Dentistry ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Distal ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' health knowledge ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' Head Start ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' reservation-based ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' academic preparation ', ' academic readiness ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K99,2016,100034,0.3155904259658817
"Complex Systems Science Approaches to Addressing Oral Health Disparities Oral health disparities, particularly among children, continue to be a pressing problem in the US. While the oral health of children has improved overall, those from disadvantaged population groups continue to suffer from a greater than average disease burden. Oral health disparities reflect a complex set of pathways and mechanisms with bidirectional associations (feedback loops) that traverse the macro- and micro-levels of disease causation. The overall goal of this proposal is to facilitate the candidate’s long term career goal of becoming an independent social epidemiologist capable of investigating disease causation and prevention through a complex systems-based perspective. The current proposal aims to provide the candidate with the opportunity to develop the necessary skills and experience to achieve research independence by extending their formal training in epidemiology and applied experiences in oral health disparities research. Development activities proposed during the mentored phase are related to training the candidate in Complex Systems Science (CSS) approaches, namely social network analysis (SNA) and agent-based modeling (ABM). Training will occur through coursework, multidisciplinary mentoring and applied research experiences. The primary vehicle for development is the research plan. The proposed research aims to use CSS approaches to better understand the factors and mechanisms underlying oral health among a disadvantaged population, and to improve the strategies aimed at improving oral health, thereby reducing observed disparities. These approaches facilitate an understanding of the population, social interaction and environmental influence simultaneously and can explore interactions, feedback loops and reciprocity between independent and dependent variables. The first phase of the proposed work aims to develop a detailed conceptual model of oral health disparities that captures the multi-level mechanisms and will be used to inform the development of an agent-based model. ABM refers to the use of stochastic computer simulations to understand how the distribution of health and disease on a population level emerge from explicitly programmed health behaviors, social interactions and movements of simulated individuals over simulated time. An ABM of oral health and social networks among residents of public housing will be developed and utilized to identify viable intervention targets. The second phase of the work proposes to conduct a longitudinal SNA of adult caregivers of young children residing in public housing. SNA is an empirical tool that has been utilized to better understand the social context within which individuals interact. The planned analysis will serve to provide longitudinal data that can be used to validate the estimates of intervention targets obtained from the agent-based model. Additionally, the feasibility and acceptability of a potential network-based intervention will be evaluated within the sample. Completion of the described aims will represent one of the first applications of complex systems science methods to oral health disparities and demarcate the independent research career of the candidate. The proposed research aims to address oral health disparities using complex systems science approaches. Oral health disparities reflect a complex set of pathways and mechanisms with bidirectional associations (feedback loops) that traverse the macro- and micro-levels of disease causation.

"Family Intervention with Caregivers of Children with Dental Needs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries (tooth decay) in 2--11 year olds is increasing especially among poor and minority populations, and it is unlikely that Healthy People 2020 goals will be met. Dental screening of children in elementary schools has been mandated in 12 states and endorsed by US organizations and WHO. In spite of enthusiasm for the concept, screening and standard referral letters have been ineffective in getting parents/caregivers to take children to the dentist. Caregiver-level engagement or action is necessary to motivate follow-up on child- level interventions at schools. Thus, we propose an experimental intervention based upon the Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM) to address parent/caregiver illness perception (cognitive representation: identity, consequences, controllability, cause, timeline; and emotional representation) and navigation of resources to increase receipt of dental care for children with restorative dental needs. The Specific Aims of the proposed multi-site double-blind Phase III randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) study are: (1) Utilizing a three arm design, to evaluate the new CSM theory-driven referral letter alone or the new CSM referral letter + Dental Information Guide (DIG: facts about dental caries, hints for getting dental care, making appointments and Medicaid access, transportation and dentists availability resources) compared to a standard referral letter to increase receipt of dental care among inner-city urban African American, and rural Hispanic and White elementary school children; (2) To assess changes in parent/caregiver illness representation/perception and behavioral intention between the beginning and end of school year to understand the underlying mechanisms of the new vs. standard referral approach resulting in receipt of dental care. There will be 2 study sites: Ohio (East Cleveland City School District); Oregon (Jefferson County School District 509-J and Morrow County School District). All K-4th grade children and caregivers will be recruited through school district events. Children will be screened at beginning of the school year to determine caregiver eligibility for participation in the RCT. A total of 660 caregivers whose children have restorative dental needs will be randomized to the 3 study arms, and intervention letters will be sent home. Data collection includes: child baseline screening and follow-up dental exam at the study exit 7 mos later to determine if the child received care; caregiver illness perception questionnaire revised for dental (IPQ-RD) and a caregiver questionnaire at 3 time points (baseline, one-month after receipt of intervention letters exit). Data analysis for aim 1 includes a multivariate logistic regression model with adjustment for baseline characteristics; and aim 2 includes a generalized causal mediation analysis to delineate the mechanism (or paths) through which interventions impact dental care receipt. This behavioral intervention has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for screening by utilizing a cost- effective, easily transportable, and sustainable approach. The RCT is a collaboration of Case Western Reserve University and University of Washington Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will test an innovative behavioral approach to the referral process never attempted before. The new intervention letter and information guide are intended to change caregiver illness perception by addressing three issues - (1) knowing the importance of caries-free baby teeth for protection of permanent teeth (2) viewing dental caries as a chronic disease rather than acute or episodic; and (3) navigation of resources for dental care access. This new referral approach also has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for school screening programs required by law in many states.",Family Intervention with Caregivers of Children with Dental Needs,9292411,U01DE024167,"['Appointment ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dentists ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Family ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Laws ', ' Medicaid ', ' Ohio ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Oregon ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Private Practice ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Transportation ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Writing ', ' County ', ' Primary Dentition ', ' Deciduous Dentition ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' TimeLine ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Dental ', ' Rural ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Dentistry for Children ', ' Dental Care for Children ', ' Secondary Dentition ', ' Permanent Dentition ', ' Adult Dentition ', ' permanent tooth ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' restoration ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' inner city ', ' grade school ', ' elementary school ', ' success ', ' care seeking ', ' Prevention program ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' 4th grade ', ' fourth grade ', ' 2nd grade ', ' second grade ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' kindergarten ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 9 year old ', ' nine year old ', ' age 9 years ', ' 11 year old ', ' eleven year old ', ' age 11 years ', ' demographics ', ' illness perceptions ', ' critical period ', ' primary outcome ', ' arm ', ' three-arm study ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' urgent care ', ' Prevention trial ', ' school district ', ' minority children ', ' ']",NIDCR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,345391,0.14111616459828563
"Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia ABSTRACT  Oral disease, in particular childhood caries, remains a major health burden which affects some communities disproportionally, including regions of Appalachia. Both increased sugar intake and frequency of exposure alter the oral microbial community, triggering a disease process that leads to caries. Additional factors associated with caries in children include genetic risk, household SES, maternal caregiving behavior and stress, access to care. Progress has been made in understanding many of these factors. However, much remains to be done in order to further characterize individual risk factors, but just as importantly, to determine how interactions between them lead to oral health disparities.  The current proposal is a renewal of our ongoing project (R01-DE-014899) to identify factors contributing to the oral health disparity seen in northern Appalachia. The guiding philosophy of our project (the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia; COHRA) has been and continues to be that developing strategies to address this disparity requires simultaneous study of multiple risk components (ideally within families) to determine their roles, interactions among them, and their transmissibility patterns. COHRA's long- term goal remains to determine the sources of oral health disparity in a high risk, Northern Appalachian population so that effective preventive interventions can be designed and targeted.  During the previous project period that began Sept 1, 2009, we recruited a cohort of approximately 1000 northern Appalachian women during pregnancy (COHRA2), following them and their children through their children's second birthday. This prospective study of mother-child pairs complements the original cohort of approximately 840 northern Appalachian families (COHRA1) by gathering multifaceted, longitudinal data on the earliest antecedents of caries formation. As detailed in the progress report, the specific aims of the previous project period (using both COHRA1 and COHRA2 cohorts) were all accomplished (recruitment targets, genetic analyses of the COHRA1 cohort, psychosocial investigations, microbial assessments). We propose to follow the current COHRA2 cohort as it grows from ages 2 to 6, and to use the resulting longitudinal demographic, medical, diet, and psychosocial data to test hypotheses about the causal relationships between risk factors contributing to the unusually high rates of caries formation in this population. We will integrate the additional data to be collected with existing and new genetic and microbial data to identify “cariogenic profiles,” in which the interactions between mother and child genetics, oral ecology, diet, and other environmental/psychosocial behaviors in infancy and early childhood are combined to predict unusually high risks for onset of caries before age 6. NARRATIVE Oral disease, in particular childhood caries, remains a major health burden which affects some communities disproportionally, including regions of Appalachia. The goal of the requested competing continuation remains to determine the factors leading to oral health disparity in children followed up to age 6 from a high risk, Northern Appalachian population.",Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia,9175485,R01DE014899,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Behavior ', ' Beverages ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Household ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mining ', ' Mothers ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Phenotype ', ' Philosophy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Woman ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Natural History ', ' Medical ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Genetic ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Oral ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Viral ', ' psychosocial ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' stressed mothers ', ' maternal stress ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' early onset ', ' antimicrobial peptide ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' microbial community ', ' Microbial Genetics ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' high risk ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' maternal caregiving ', ' maternal care giving ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,2757967,0.27427076199661
"Determining high risk HPV status in the underserved ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 40,000 people will be diagnosed with oral cancer this year and over 8,000 people will die from this disease. Men suffer from oral cancer at a rate four times greater than women. The incidence and mortality rate for African American/black (AA/B) and white women in the U.S. is fairly similar. AA/B and white males also have a similar disease incidence; however, AA/B males die at a rate 3-4 times that of their white counterparts. Socioeconomic status resulting in limited access to healthcare for the poor has played a large role in that disparity, with more AA/B men being diagnosed with metastatic disease which is linked to poor prognosis. Historically a disease of tobacco and/or alcohol abuse, oral cancer was declining as a result of decreases in smoking but the decline slowed around the year 2000 when a new cause, with increasing incidence, was identified. That new oral cancer agent was the human papilloma virus (HPV). It has now been suggested that white males are more likely than AA/B males to have HPV-positive oral cancer, a form of the disease that responds better to therapy, and this is driving the disparity in mortality. Studies actually quantifying HPV in tumors of AA/B males are few and more work needs to be done to confirm that that is the case. More recent reports suggest that AA/B and white males have similar incidence of HPV-positive oral cancer, but the progression of the disease is different in AA/B individuals. In this study, we will ask and answer the following questions: 1) do AA/B and white males from underserved populations have similar amounts of HPV+ oral cancer, 2) are the HPV subtypes the same in these two groups and, 3) is the progression of HPV-associated cellular and molecular changes the same for AA/B and white individuals and could late stage at diagnosis be a result of differing disease progression rather than delayed diagnosis? The answers to these questions will be analyzed along with other variables that are associated with prognosis, such as age at diagnosis, stage at diagnosis, tumor grade, a history of risk factors such as alcohol and tobacco abuse, therapy prescribed, completion of therapy and response to therapy. This comprehensive assessment will lend incredible insight into the reasons for the high death rate for AA/B men and will result in future research that will depend upon the outcomes of this work. This could include education and outreach towards the prevention of HPV infection and the development of new therapies specific for HPV- positive oral cancer. This work is important because oral cancer is a painful and destructive disease with poor outcomes for all and disproportionately so for AA/B males. The disparity in mortality cannot be adequately addressed until the factors contributing to it are identified.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Black males in the U.S. die from cancers of the oral cavity and oropharynx at a rate two to three times greater than their white counterparts. The reason for this disparity is likely multifactorial, but it is thought that some, or possibly much, of this disarity is due either to a difference in the number of cases caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), a difference in the type of HPV and/or a difference in the way HPV affects the oral target cells. This research evaluates these three factors in an underserved population consisting of, roughly, equal parts black and white individuals (predominantly males) to begin to determine whether this virus is a major determinant of racial disparities in outcome for people suffering from this debilitating, painful, and frequently fatal, disease.                ",Determining high risk HPV status in

"COordinated Oral health Promotion (CO-OP) Chicago ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Almost half of children 11 years old and younger suffer from dental caries, making caries one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood. Low income and minority children bear a disproportionate portion of this burden. In Chicago, these disparities are obvious with 63% of Chicago-area 3rd-graders having dental caries and over half of these caries are untreated. Pediatric dental caries are associated with pain, more severe infections, malnutrition, speech difficulties, poor school performance, cosmetic problems, and an overall lower quality of life. While many oral health interventions have been developed to reduce the incidence of caries, even the most successful programs have limited effectiveness in high risk children. The delivery and receipt of proper preventive oral healthcare involves social and environmental factors that operate on individual, family, and community levels. Multi-level interventions recognize the need to target these levels simultaneously but multi-level oral health interventions for the primary prevention of dental caries are lacking. COordinated Oral health Promotion (CO-OP) Chicago brings together a team of clinical pediatricians and dentists, researchers, health psychologists, and policy experts to rigorously test the ability of an oral health promotion intervention to improve child and family oral health. The primary intervention is family-focused education and support from community health workers (CHWs); this intervention will be applied in a range of settings to determine which settings, or combination of settings, result in the best outcomes. The Aim of the UH2 Phase is to formalize partnerships and finalize study design and protocol. This includes: 1) A formative assessment to determine partner operations, resources, and needs; 2) CHW training; 3) Pilot testing of recruitment and intervention protocols; 4) Creation of a final Manual of Procedures; and 5) Obtain clearances/contracts from all institutional and community partners. The UH3 Phase then implements and evaluates the intervention in 15 clinics, 15 WIC sites, and 1520 individual families. Aim 1 is to evaluate the ability of a clinic-based family-focused CHW intervention to improve child oral health; Aim 2 evaluates the ability of a WIC-based family-focused CHW intervention to improve child oral health; Aim 3 evaluates the ability of a home-based family-focused CHW intervention to improve child oral health; and Aim 4 determines the added value of combining interventions. The hypothesis is that participants receiving home-based CHWs and clinic-based or WIC-based CHW interventions will have the best oral health outcomes at 12-months. The primary outcome is incidence of early childhood caries, determined by the Caries Severity Index. The study will also employ the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) to evaluate program effectiveness. The results of this study have the potential to influence oral health programming, workforce development, and reimbursement on the local, state, and national level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  COordinated Oral health Promotion (CO-OP) Chicago will test the impact of a family-focused community health worker intervention for oral health promotion when applied alone in clinical, WIC, and home settings, and when applied in combination. The results of this study have the potential to influence oral health programming, workforce development, and reimbursement on the local, state, and national level.",COordinated Oral health Promotion (CO-OP) Chicago,9146308,UH2DE025483,"['Adoption ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Chicago ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' cosmetic product ', ' Cosmetics ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dentists ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Illinois ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Infection ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maintenance ', ' Manuals ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Psychologist ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Malnutrition ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' malnourished ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' pediatrician ', ' Policies ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Oral ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' early childhood ', ' Participant ', ' cultural competence ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Preventive ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Social Health Services ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' 11 year old ', ' eleven year old ', ' age 11 years ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' primary outcome ', ' operation ', ' formative assessment ', ' formative evaluation ', ' Workforce Development ', ' individual patient ', ' minority children ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,UH2,2016,744221,0.34078608251128045
"Obesity and Caries in Young South Asian Children: A Common Risk Factor Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Asians are the fastest growing immigrant community in the United States and experience high rates of health disparities. South Asian children are at high risk for the two most common diseases of early childhood: caries and obesity. This application uses the Common Risk/Health Factor Approach (CR/HFA) to target risk factors for childhood caries and obesity. Our study, CHALO! (""Child Health Action to Lower Oral Health and Obesity Risk"") comes from the Hindi word that means ""Let's go!"". CHALO is a multi-level intervention (see figure) that includes a randomized controlled trial of a home visit intervention, and a Knowledge Translation campaign. The primary focus is behavioral change in bottle/'sippy' cup use and dietary intake-- factors that are common to both caries and obesity. Unique cariogenic and obesogenic behaviors are also targeted. Secondary outcomes include caries incidence and growth. Research assessments when children are 6 (baseline), 12, and 18 months of age will include novel techniques for assessing feeding practices (i.e., iPad assisted 24 hour dietary recall) and caries presence and severity (i.e., intra-oral cameras) that were developed by our team. CHALO will be conducted in the metro NY/NJ area, home to a large low-income high risk South Asian community. An RCT (Aim 1) will enroll 377 mothers of children 4-6 months old from New York City (n=3) and New Jersey (n=2) pediatric practices in our primary care research network SAPPHIRE (""SA Practice Partnership for Health Improvement and Research""). The intervention includes: a) home visits with mothers/families (n=6 visits over one year) and follow up phone support; b) patient navigation to make/keep timely dental visits (2x by 18 months). The Knowledge Translation component (Aim 2) will raise awareness of child health risks in South Asian communities and among professionals who provide their care. The campaign will include both traditional and social media components and will be evaluated using multiple metrics. Our multi-disciplinary team has expertise in cross-cultural psychology, clinical trials, child nutrition, health education and caries. CHALO builds upon the team's prior and on-going funded trials of caries and obesity interventions in young children. Innovations include: use of CR/HFA to target twin child health disparities; under-studied South Asian immigrant sample; intervention at multiple levels of the Social-Ecological model; cutting edge measurement technologies; and social marketing and evaluation. If successful, the CR/HFA offers an efficient and potentially cost-effective means of improving child health in at-risk populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study employs a Common Risk/Health Factors Approach (CR/HFA) to the 2 most common health disparities of early childhood -dental caries and obesity-- in the nation's fast growing low-income South Asian immigrant community. It includes: a) an RCT- aimed at reducing feeding practices that increase caries and obesity risks (e.g., use of bottle/'sippy' cups) and increasing health-promoting behaviors (activity, dental visit) in young children, and b) a Knowledge Translation campaign to raise awareness among families, communities, and dental and pediatric providers. This study represents the first application of the CR/HFA in the nation, and only the second RCT of this efficient and potentially cost-effective approach worldwide.",Obesity and Caries in Young South Asian Children: A Common Risk Factor Approach,9083501,R01MD010460,"['Anxiety ', ' Awareness ', ' Bangladesh ', ' Behavior ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child ', ' child healthcare ', ' Child health care ', ' pediatric nutrition ', ' Child Nutrition ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Care ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Decay ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental caries ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Family ', ' Feeding Patterns ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health education ', ' House Call ', ' Incidence ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Methods ', ' Milk ', ' Mothers ', ' New Jersey ', ' New York City ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Obesity ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Pakistan ', ' Partnership Practice ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Marketing ', ' Sweeteners ', ' Sweetening Agents ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' tooth brushing ', ' Toothbrushing ', ' Twins ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Dental ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Oral ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Napping ', ' Intervention ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Juice ', ' Dietary intake ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Length ', ' Age-Months ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' South Asian ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Community Health ', ' Behavioral ', ' obesity in children ', ' child adiposity ', ' child obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obese children ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' Home visitation ', ' House Call ', ' home visit ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' tv watching ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' feeding ', ' cost effective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' knowledge translation ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' secondary outcome ', ' obesogenic ', ' obesigenic ', ' social media ', ' ']",NIMHD,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2016,625804,0.11087885270837702
"Family Intervention with Caregivers of Children with Dental Needs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dental caries (tooth decay) in 2--11 year olds is increasing especially among poor and minority populations, and it is unlikely that Healthy People 2020 goals will be met. Dental screening of children in elementary schools has been mandated in 12 states and endorsed by US organizations and WHO. In spite of enthusiasm for the concept, screening and standard referral letters have been ineffective in getting parents/caregivers to take children to the dentist. Caregiver-level engagement or action is necessary to motivate follow-up on child- level interventions at schools. Thus, we propose an experimental intervention based upon the Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM) to address parent/caregiver illness perception (cognitive representation: identity, consequences, controllability, cause, timeline; and emotional representation) and navigation of resources to increase receipt of dental care for children with restorative dental needs. The Specific Aims of the proposed multi-site double-blind Phase III randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) study are: (1) Utilizing a three arm design, to evaluate the new CSM theory-driven referral letter alone or the new CSM referral letter + Dental Information Guide (DIG: facts about dental caries, hints for getting dental care, making appointments and Medicaid access, transportation and dentists availability resources) compared to a standard referral letter to increase receipt of dental care among inner-city urban African American, and rural Hispanic and White elementary school children; (2) To assess changes in parent/caregiver illness representation/perception and behavioral intention between the beginning and end of school year to understand the underlying mechanisms of the new vs. standard referral approach resulting in receipt of dental care. There will be 2 study sites: Ohio (East Cleveland City School District); Oregon (Jefferson County School District 509-J and Morrow County School District). All K-4th grade children and caregivers will be recruited through school district events. Children will be screened at beginning of the school year to determine caregiver eligibility for participation in the RCT. A total of 660 caregivers whose children have restorative dental needs will be randomized to the 3 study arms, and intervention letters will be sent home. Data collection includes: child baseline screening and follow-up dental exam at the study exit 7 mos later to determine if the child received care; caregiver illness perception questionnaire revised for dental (IPQ-RD) and a caregiver questionnaire at 3 time points (baseline, one-month after receipt of intervention letters exit). Data analysis for aim 1 includes a multivariate logistic regression model with adjustment for baseline characteristics; and aim 2 includes a generalized causal mediation analysis to delineate the mechanism (or paths) through which interventions impact dental care receipt. This behavioral intervention has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for screening by utilizing a cost- effective, easily transportable, and sustainable approach. The RCT is a collaboration of Case Western Reserve University and University of Washington Northwest Center to Reduce Oral Health Disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will test an innovative behavioral approach to the referral process never attempted before. The new intervention letter and information guide are intended to change caregiver illness perception by addressing three issues - (1) knowing the importance of caries-free baby teeth for protection of permanent teeth (2) viewing dental caries as a chronic disease rather than acute or episodic; and (3) navigation of resources for dental care access. This new referral approach also has the potential to change the public health standard of practice for school screening programs required by law in many states.",Family Intervention with Caregivers of Children with Dental Needs,9133327,U01DE024167,"['Appointment ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dentists ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Family ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Laws ', ' Medicaid ', ' Ohio ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Oregon ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Private Practice ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Schools ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Transportation ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Writing ', ' County ', ' Primary Dentition ', ' Deciduous Dentition ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' TimeLine ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Dental ', ' Rural ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Dentistry for Children ', ' Dental Care for Children ', ' Secondary Dentition ', ' Permanent Dentition ', ' Adult Dentition ', ' permanent tooth ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' restoration ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' inner city ', ' grade school ', ' elementary school ', ' success ', ' care seeking ', ' Prevention program ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' 4th grade ', ' fourth grade ', ' 2nd grade ', ' second grade ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' kindergarten ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 9 year old ', ' nine year old ', ' age 9 years ', ' 11 year old ', ' eleven year old ', ' age 11 years ', ' demographics ', ' illness perceptions ', ' critical period ', ' primary outcome ', ' arm ', ' three-arm study ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' urgent care ', ' Prevention trial ', ' school district ', ' minority children ', ' ']",NIDCR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,547337,0.14111616459828563
"Role of Non-Dental Providers in Reducing Disparities in Early Childhood Oral Health: Impact of State Medicaid Policies Project Summary Early childhood caries (ECC), commonly referred to as tooth decay, is a preventable disease that disproportionally affects children enrolled in Medicaid and other historically disadvantaged groups. Receiving preventive oral health services (POHS) at an early age helps to prevent ECC, yet populations experiencing the most ECC have the lowest use of POHS. To improve access to POHS for these vulnerable populations, nearly all state Medicaid programs have adopted policies covering physician-based POHS.

"Role of Non-Dental Providers in Reducing Disparities in Early Childhood Oral Health: Impact of State Medicaid Policies Project Summary Early childhood caries (ECC), commonly referred to as tooth decay, is a preventable disease that disproportionally affects children enrolled in Medicaid and other historically disadvantaged groups. Receiving preventive oral health services (POHS) at an early age helps to prevent ECC, yet populations experiencing the most ECC have the lowest use of POHS. To improve access to POHS for these vulnerable populations, nearly all state Medicaid programs have adopted policies covering physician-based POHS. Despite widespread adoption of policies and evidence of policy effectiveness, states exhibit variation in rates of physician-based POHS use. This project will explore how physician-based POHS coverage policies have affected POHS use and oral health outcomes of Medicaid-enrolled infants and toddlers over time, overall, and among historically underserved and high-risk populations.

"Dental Health and Academic Achievement among Children in Medicaid Project Summary/Abstract Dental problems are the leading chronic conditions among children in the United States (US) and are more prevalent among children of low socioeconomic status. Dental health plays a key role in the overall health status and quality of life of children and may affect several domains of child development and growth including learning. However little is known about the broader impacts of dental health on children's academic achievement in the United States. A few studies have focused on the relationships between children's dental health and their educational performance. Most studies however have utilized self-reported data on dental health and schooling achievement and those that used objective measures included small samples with limited generalizability. This literature suggests that dental problems are related to worse schooling performance such as lower grades and school attendance. However, this evidence indicates association and not necessarily causal links as it is based on cross-sectional data and suffers from several limitations including the potential for unobservable confounders that can bias the estimates such as household dental care practices and parental style. Finally and perhaps most importantly, practically nothing is known about how seeking preventive dental care prior to school entry and during schooling years impacts educational achievement. We will identify the effects of dental health problems on trajectories of academic achievement of children in Medicaid in Iowa comparing children with dental problems to their unaffected siblings and classmates. Furthermore, we will examine the effects of preventive dental care on academic achievement using similar group comparisons as well as within-child changes over time. Those comparisons control for many potential confounders. Our study employs unique population-based and longitudinal data consisting of linkages between Medicaid enrollment and claims files, birth certificates, and high-quality objective measures of academic achievement based on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) and the Iowa Tests of Educational Development (ITED), which are administered regularly to virtually all students in Iowa. The sample includes around 40,000 children born between 2000 and 2007 and nearly 300,000 child- grade observations. Our work is highly impactful and innovative in being the first population-based study of the effects of dental health and service use on children's academic achievement in the US using objective measures and longitudinal data that allows tracking children over time to study their achievement trajectories. Identifying the interplays between dental health and academic achievement could ultimately inform the designing of pre-school and school-based interventions focused on dental health assessment and treatment to prevent and reduce learning problems. Furthermore, this knowledge will help to more accurately assess the societal value of policies and programs that improve access to dental care through childhood and adolescence. This study will identify the effects of dental problems as well as use of preventive dental care on the educational achievement of children enrolled in Medicaid in Iowa. This research will provide information about contributors to learning problems among children in this population and can ultimately help in designing policies and interventions related to dental health that also improve educational achievement.",Dental Health and Academic Achievement among Children in Medicaid,9314674,R03DE026224,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Affect ', ' Birth Certificates ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Household ', ' Investments ', ' Iowa ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicaid ', ' Ohio ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Dental Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Siblings ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Dental ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' psychosocial ', ' elementary school ', ' grade school ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' comparison group ', ' oral cleft ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' population based ', ' cognitive development ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive dental care ', ' Preventive dental service ', ' Preventative dental service ', ' Preventative dental care ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R03,2017,152500,0.09697068745435458
"Phase III RCT of the Effectiveness of Silver Diamine Fluoride in Arresting Cavitated Caries Lesions Summary The proposed Cooperative Agreement is for support for a Phase III randomized clinical trial (RCT) to assess the effectiveness of 38% silver diamine fluoride (SDF). SDF recently became available in the U.S., and is non-invasive, inexpensive and simple to use for management of cavitated lesions exposing dentin clinically (i.e., holes) in primary teeth. Early childhood caries (ECC) continues to be one of the most prevalent chronic conditions among U.S. children. It also is one of the most common unmet healthcare needs of poor children (e.g., Head Start children). If allowed to progress untreated for long periods of time, the disease can have broad dental, medical, social, and quality of life consequences. ECC and severe-ECC (e.g., multiple cavitated lesions or at least one caries lesion in the anterior teeth, with onset at an early age) is relatively inexpensive to prevent, yet becomes extremely burdensome on the children and families, and expensive to treat once lesions cavitate (e.g., with stainless steel crowns, extractions, etc.). This is especially true in young children who need extensive treatment, or are uncooperative and/or have immature cognitive functioning, disabilities, or medical conditions, where treatment under general anesthesia, in most cases in hospital operating rooms, is the standard of care. In 2016, the FDA issued a notice to health care providers that general anesthesia in young children can result in permanent neurological damage and should be avoided. Thus, better strategies are needed to successfully manage cavitated caries lesions in young children. The proposed RCT will be accomplished by targeting young children enrolled in Head Start programs who have cavitated caries lesions that have exposed dentin clinically. Because of the Breakthrough Therapy Status for SDF, FDA has been heavily involved in the design of this trial to ensure it will meet the requirements for a cavitated caries lesion “arrest” drug claim, which is innovative in the U.S. The proposed protocol in this application has been submitted by Advantage Silver Dental Arrest, LLC, holder of IND 124808, to the FDA as part of our collaboration. In the first months of funding, we will work with NIDCR to review all relevant study documents and manuals for the RCT, submit to IRBs, and calibrate all study examiners. Following this study preparation period, an experienced research team will conduct a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled superiority trial, with two parallel groups involving a total of 1,040 children, 2-5 years old, who will be followed over a period of 8 months, to assess: The tooth-Aim 1 (Primary study aim)- the impact of 38% SDF applied twice, 6 months apart, on arrest of cavitated lesions in the primary dentition (assessed using the ICDAS II severity and activity criteria). Secondary aims will further assess whether the provision of SDF impacts: the child-Aim 2 [effects of SDF on children's pain and pulpal infection], and the family-Aim 3 [effects of SDF on oral health-related quality of life (Sub-Aim 3a), and treatment satisfaction and acceptability (Sub-Aim 3b)]. The immediate impact and significance of this innovative project is that provision of and access to a non-invasive, inexpensive, and simple to use alternative strategy to manage cavitated caries lesions for children with limited access to care could profoundly improve oral health by arresting lesions, reducing pain, improving quality of life, and significantly reducing costs, all contributing to substantial reductions in disparities in caries. Project Narrative: The University of Michigan, in collaboration with researchers at New York University, the University of Iowa, Indiana University, the University of Otago, and consultants from the University of Hong Kong and University of Maryland propose to implement a Phase III multicenter, randomized clinical trial (RCT), to test the effectiveness of 38% Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF) in stopping the progression of cavities (i.e., large holes which result from dental caries, a common and debilitating disease) in the teeth of young children. Should the trial be successful, the impact would be a change in the standard of care and expanded access to a simple, non-invasive, inexpensive strategy to manage cavitated caries lesions in young children in the U.S., which otherwise are usually treated with potentially damaging general anesthesia and fillings or extractions. Access to this simple treatment should result in a reduction of disparities in access to care, and improvements in oral health, which addresses the NIDCR Strategic Plan Goal 3 [to apply rigorous, multidisciplinary research approaches to overcome disparities in dental, oral, and craniofacial health].",Phase III RCT of the Effectiveness of Silver Diamine Fluoride in Arresting Cavitated Caries Lesions,9426625,U01DE027372,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' General Anesthesia ', ' Calibration ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Informed Consent Forms ', ' Informed Consent Documents ', ' Consent Documents ', ' Consent Forms ', ' Crowns ', ' Dental crowns ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dentin ', ' Diamines ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Fluorides ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hongkong ', ' Hong Kong ', ' Hospitals ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Indiana ', ' Infection ', ' Iowa ', ' Manuals ', ' Maryland ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' New York ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Placebos ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Safety ', ' Silver ', ' Ag element ', ' Stainless Steel ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' dentalgia ', ' dental pain ', ' Odontalgia ', ' Toothache ', ' Universities ', ' Dental White Spots ', ' White Spots ', ' Work ', ' Deciduous Dentition ', ' Primary Dentition ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' Drug Approval ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Anterior ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Dental ', ' disability ', ' Visual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' craniofacial ', ' craniofacies ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Head Start ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Agreement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Modeling ', ' Documentation ', ' chemical resource ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' U-Series Cooperative Agreements ', ' Cooperative Agreements ', ' Improve Access ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Case Report Form ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Placebo Control ', ' oral care ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 5 year old ', ' five years of age ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 years of age ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' effectiveness clinical trial ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' Secure ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' screening ', ' trial design ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2017,2027212,0.16436086854165302
"Predicting Caries Risk in Underserved Children, from Toddlers to the School-Age Years, in Primary Healthcare Settings Project Summary/Abstract: Dental caries, one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood, is a largely preventable disease, yet approximately 23% of U.S. children 2-5 years-of-age experience dental caries, and this number more than doubles to 56% among those aged 6-8. In the current environment of escalating healthcare costs and resource constraints, the large disparities in caries experience and access to care that exist in the U.S., especially among low socioeconomic status (SES) and minority population groups, call for a greater focus on targeted (at the patient and tooth surface level), risk-based caries preventive and therapeutic strategies to be delivered through interprofessional partnerships, including primary healthcare settings. Our team has just finished following 1,326 children from age 1 to age 4, and we have started data analyses to validate a caries risk questionnaire for use by medical providers to accurately identify high caries risk toddlers. The problem is that, while caries experience more than doubles from ages 2-5 to 6-8, caries in primary teeth during mixed dentition is a largely neglected area of research and prevention, there is no validated caries risk tool for medical settings to easily help triage 5- 8 year old children, and there have been almost no studies following the life-course progression of caries in children 1-8. This information is critically important, as designing and targeting efficacious and cost-effective preventive therapies that can adapt to changes in the life-course from toddlers to school-age children is dependent on accurate risk factor and tooth surface assessment. Thus, the objectives of this innovative continuation renewal study are: 1) to develop a practical and easily-scored caries risk tool for use in primary medical healthcare settings to identify high caries risk children, expanding from the toddler (1-4) to the school-age years (5-8); and 2) to determine the relationships between caries risk profiles and caries disease patterns (e.g., occlusal vs. proximal) in the mixed dentition. This will be accomplished by following a cohort of 876 primary caregiver (PCG)-child pairs from our ongoing U01's enrolled pairs. This cohort represents a diverse population, including ethnic/racial minorities and low SES groups. The PCG will complete a caries risk questionnaire and the child will have caries examinations at baseline (child's age 5.5 years old + 3 months), and again at 18 months (child's age 7 years + 3 months) and 36 months after baseline (child's age 8.5 years + 3 months) to monitor the caries disease process. Longitudinal caries risk data and caries disease prevalence/incidence and tooth surface pattern information collected from age 1-4 (ongoing U01) and 5-8 (proposed continuing renewal) will be used to assess risk of caries in children ages 5-8. A great strength of this proposal is that it involves four experienced medical and dental investigator groups, who have successfully worked together for the past 5.5 years and can facilitate follow-up of the study cohort. The significance is that identification of high caries risk children in primary healthcare settings will allow cost- effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed, targeted and used in interprofessional settings to prevent caries development from the toddler to the school-age years. This will have immediate broad impact and influence on existing and/or new policies and programs to be delivered by non-dental professionals in medical settings and other non- healthcare settings (e.g., school-based), as well as by dental professionals in dental healthcare settings. Relevance:  The relevance of this collaborative, innovative and high impact project (continuing renewal of our ongoing caries risk study U01-DE021412-06) is that it will result in a valid, reliable, and practical (easy to score) caries risk assessment tool for the identification of high caries risk children, expanding from the toddler to the school-age years, in primary medical healthcare and other non-dental settings (e.g., could be used at the required physical before entering public schools, etc.). When information collected from age 5-8 is combined with data from our ongoing U01 grant (ages 1-4), it will enhance understanding of life-course caries risk changes and changing patterns of carious tooth surfaces (e.g., occlusal vs. proximal) in children from age 1-8, allowing for cost-effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed and targeted to prevent caries. This proposal is responsive to NIDCR's Strategic Plan Goal 2.2 [Engage primary care providers and health specialists toward individualized, evidence-based health assessment, disease prevention, and treatments] and Goal 3 [Apply rigorous, multidisciplinary research approaches to overcome disparities in dental, oral, and craniofacial health].","Predicting Caries Risk in Underserved Children, from

"Center for the Biologic Basis of Oral/Systemic Diseases (Phase III)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Systemic Diseases (CBBO/SD)"" is to continue sustainability of a nationally competitive transdisciplinary research center focusing on oral healt sciences and systemic diseases within the University of Kentucky. This proposal builds upon the Phase l/ll funding for developing the research infrastructure in the College of Dentistry and supporting junior investigators to develop competitive research programs using this infrastructure. The CBBO/SD represents the concrete realization of the Specific Aims of the Phase l/ll funding that was designed to: (i) expand the critical mass of funded investigators at UK in the areas of oral and systemic health research; (ii) create and enhance cutting-edge scientific core resources that can continue to serve as platforms to increase the competitiveness of existing research faculty, as well as for recruiting new faculty; and (iii) implement the range f infrastructure improvements in the research enterprise to successfully transition the COBRE funding into long-term competitive, renewable support from a diverse array of federal and non-federal sources. The UKCD created a position for an Associate Dean for Research, and a Center for Oral Health Research (COHR) housed in the college to develop and oversee a broad range of basic and applied research beginning in 2000. This was followed by events that created a vibrant environment for implementation of the CBBO/SD in 2003 with an explicit goal of developing a center conducting research on oral and systemic health and housed in the College of Dentistry. The CBBO/SD provides a strong thematic research focus and unique resources, along with research training of graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty mentoring. From the outset this was accomplished in a collaborative framework that emphasized mentoring, scientific advancement, academic career development, competitive grantsmanship, and productivity. The Phase III proposal incorporates 4 interactive cores: Adminstrative/Educational Core, Delta Dental of Kentucky Clinical Research Center (DDKCRC) Core; Core Translational Diagnostics Laboratory (CTDL); and Oral Health Pilot Program (OI-IPP) core. The CBBO/SD Phase Ill objectives are to: (1) focus efforts and resources towards creating a sustainable university-wide research center with unique clinical and translational scientific cores providing interdisciplinary research interactions in oral and general health investigations, (2) continue to identify, Stimulate and nurture investigators at the University of Kentucky to ascertain and pursue important questions related to diseases of the oral and craniofacial complex, and (3) enhance the expansion of collaborative research programs by supplying structure and expertise in specialized core facilities supporting these research initiatives. The major research theme of the CBBO/SD generally remains similar to those throughout the Phase l/ll tenure of the center. This focused on chronic inflammatory diseases with infections and dysregulated host responses linking oral and systemic health. The CBBO/SD has a parallel goal in providing the fundamental basis for the research enterprise in the UK College of Dentistry (UKCD) to actively participate in the national clinical and translation research environment with a focus of moving clinical findings into improving health of the population with enhanced implementation of new clinical findings. As the flagship land-grant University of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the UKCD has a major role in helping to solve the massive health care needs of the Appalachian population inhabiting 54 counties in Kentucky by addressing multigenerational oral and general health disparities in Appalachian Kentucky. This will require effective interprofessional education, collaborative research initiatives, and emphasizing external funding from a wide array of NIH institutes, other federal agencies, and independent private and public funding sources. The Strategic Objectives of the Phase III aspect of the center include: understand the molecular mechanisms underlying periodontal disease; foster collaborations enabling definition of the biologic mechanisms linking periodontal disease with systemic disease(s); support collaborative efforts across the UK campus to engage additional research teams into the offering of the Genetics/Genomics services and the Mineralized Tissue services; and, continue the research relationship with the Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences at UK to implement community-based initiatives to reduce oral disease burden.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The COBRE core infrastructure will focus on supporting clinical and translational research that impacts health of the oral cavity and the individual. The substantially poor oral health metrics of the population of Kentucky, particularly rural populations, needs to be addressed with new science and new models to deliver improved health for future generations.            ",Center for the Biologic Basis of Oral/Systemic Diseases (Phase III),9325021,P30GM110788,"['Appalachian ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Dentistry ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Kentucky ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Minerals ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Periodontal Diseases ', ' periodontium disorder ', ' periodontium disease ', ' periodontal disorder ', ' Parodontosis ', ' Privatization ', ' Productivity ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rural Population ', ' Science ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' County ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' Systemic disease ', ' Source ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' Structure ', ' Funding Agency ', ' Funding Source ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Applied Research ', ' Applied Science ', ' graduate student ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Genomics ', ' Future Generations ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Center of Biomedical Research Excellence ', ' COBRE ', ' Centers of Research Excellence ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Molecular ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' craniofacial complex ', ' public health relevance ', ' population health ', ' faculty mentor ', ' faculty research ', ' translational diagnostics ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,P30,2017,1051995,0.156678648152993
"Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia ABSTRACT  Oral disease, in particular childhood caries, remains a major health burden which affects some communities disproportionally, including regions of Appalachia. Both increased sugar intake and frequency of exposure alter the oral microbial community, triggering a disease process that leads to caries. Additional factors associated with caries in children include genetic risk, household SES, maternal caregiving behavior and stress, access to care. Progress has been made in understanding many of these factors. However, much remains to be done in order to further characterize individual risk factors, but just as importantly, to determine how interactions between them lead to oral health disparities.  The current proposal is a renewal of our ongoing project (R01-DE-014899) to identify factors contributing to the oral health disparity seen in northern Appalachia. The guiding philosophy of our project (the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia; COHRA) has been and continues to be that developing strategies to address this disparity requires simultaneous study of multiple risk components (ideally within families) to determine their roles, interactions among them, and their transmissibility patterns. COHRA's long- term goal remains to determine the sources of oral health disparity in a high risk, Northern Appalachian population so that effective preventive interventions can be designed and targeted.  During the previous project period that began Sept 1, 2009, we recruited a cohort of approximately 1000 northern Appalachian women during pregnancy (COHRA2), following them and their children through their children's second birthday. This prospective study of mother-child pairs complements the original cohort of approximately 840 northern Appalachian families (COHRA1) by gathering multifaceted, longitudinal data on the earliest antecedents of caries formation. As detailed in the progress report, the specific aims of the previous project period (using both COHRA1 and COHRA2 cohorts) were all accomplished (recruitment targets, genetic analyses of the COHRA1 cohort, psychosocial investigations, microbial assessments). We propose to follow the current COHRA2 cohort as it grows from ages 2 to 6, and to use the resulting longitudinal demographic, medical, diet, and psychosocial data to test hypotheses about the causal relationships between risk factors contributing to the unusually high rates of caries formation in this population. We will integrate the additional data to be collected with existing and new genetic and microbial data to identify “cariogenic profiles,” in which the interactions between mother and child genetics, oral ecology, diet, and other environmental/psychosocial behaviors in infancy and early childhood are combined to predict unusually high risks for onset of caries before age 6. NARRATIVE Oral disease, in particular childhood caries, remains a major health burden which affects some communities disproportionally, including regions of Appalachia. The goal of the requested competing continuation remains to determine the factors leading to oral health disparity in children followed up to age 6 from a high risk, Northern Appalachian population.",Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia,9385702,R01DE014899,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Appalachian ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Behavior ', ' Beverages ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Household ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mining ', ' Mothers ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Phenotype ', ' Philosophy ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Woman ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Natural History ', ' Medical ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Oral ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Viral ', ' psychosocial ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' maternal stress ', ' stressed mothers ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' Modeling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' early onset ', ' antimicrobial peptide ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' microbial community ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' high risk ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' maternal caregiving ', ' maternal care giving ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,2675045,0.27427076199661

"Howard University Summer Research Experience Program in Oral Health Disparity for Underrepresented Racial and Ethnic Students ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How Racial disparity in oral health has been well documented for several decades. However, the disparity persists, particularly between African Americans and other ethnic groups, despite advances in diagnosis and treatment. Increasing diversity in oral health research and care workforce is an effective strategy to improve the Nation's capacity to address and eliminate oral health disparities. In this project, we propose a full-time eight-week summer research experience program (SREP) at Howard University, aiming at engaging, recruiting and training undergraduate students from underrepresented minority and other disparity populations into minority health care and oral health disparity research. This SREP is designed to be a specialized didactic and mentored academic program with a series of formal and informal research and education activities tailored for recruiting and training undergraduate students.  To provide effective mentoring for the students, we will: 1) develop a highly networked team of motivated and skilled mentors from various disciplines through the strong partnership between Howard and Johns Hopkins Universities; and 2) develop an effective and sustainable research training and education infrastructure by establishing a 3-tiered Mentoring System, Committees of Execution and Advising, and an Evaluation Core. The 3-tiered Mentoring System is specifically designed for mentoring each participating undergraduate by a primary mentor with basic, translational or public research focus at Howard, a secondary senior mentor at Johns Hopkins and other institutes, and a career development advisory mentor from oral health professionals.  The SREP is also designed to be an extension for two existing training programs at Howard University College of Dentistry: the NIH funded P20 program for training dental school students and faculty, and the HRSA funded Post-doctoral Training Program in Pediatric Dentistry (PTPD). Different from the two programs, the proposed SREP emphasizes on providing research experience for underrepresented undergraduates in oral health disparity. This program, combined with the P20 and PTPD programs, will bring together Howard students from diverse backgrounds and interests to create a rich mix of participants from across disciplinary backgrounds.  Through the SREP, we will be able to provide summer research training for five highly qualified students every year over the 5-year funding period (a total of 25 students). By participating in multi-disciplinary research projects and education events of senior investigators who will serve as mentors and role models, the students will gain valuable research experience and knowledge in oral health, and promote them into advanced education in oral health. Successful completion of this program will have significantly impacted the dental, oral and craniofacial research and training environment at Howard University College of Dentistry.

"Interactive Parent-targeted Text Messaging in Pediatric Clinics to Reduce ECC ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to RFA-DE-15-006 ""Multidisciplinary and Collaborative Research Consortium to Reduce Oral Health Disparities in Children: A Multi-level Approach."" The prevalence of Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is increasing, disproportionately affecting racial and ethnic minorities (Dye, 2007). Prevention efforts for high risk groups require multi-level strategies. We will target parents/legal guardians of children (<6 years) during pediatric well-child visits at urban community health centers (CHCs), and provide a text-message based ECC prevention intervention. We will also target the pediatric providers in the CHCs to adopt oral health guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and also improve documentation within their Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Thus, our multi-level intervention includes children, parents, providers and the CHC system. 85% of adults use text messaging, with no disparities by race/ethnicity, education or income. The benefits of text message interventions include the use anywhere/anytime, low cost, scalability to large populations, ability to tailor message content and intensity, and provision of strategies in real time. CHCs are an ideal venue for oral health promotion both at an individual level (they provide care to the groups at highest risk for ECC) and at a population level (there are 90 CHCs electronically linked locally and >1,100 CHCs nationally). In Phase 1 (UH2), we will conduct focus groups and interviews with parents and CHC providers to inform the development of the oral health text message intervention, as well as assess CHC work flow to identify sustainable strategies for oral health integration and eventual dissemination. This formative work is vital to ensure cultural and environmental compatibility, as we have done previously. The text messages will be consistent with AAP guidelines, our theoretical model (Social Cognitive Theory), and our previous work. We will use the Fisher-Owens Model (2007) as an intervention planning framework. In Phase 2 (UH3), 850 parents/legal guardians of children <6 years attending our target CHCs will be randomized to receive one of two dose-equivalent text message interventions: Oral Health Texts (OHT) or Child Wellness Texts (CWT). The primary outcome variable will be ECC incidence at 24 months. We will assess mediators and moderators of the intervention effect, perform a budget impact analysis to determine the financial consequences of adoption, diffusion, and sustainability of the OHT intervention at CHCs, assess CHC changes in oral health promotion (provider practices and EHR documentation), and assess changes in both pediatric and parent oral health behaviors. This research has strong potential to be an evidence based program that could easily be adopted at low cost and low provider burden in the 1,128 CHCs in the U.S. that treat almost 4.5 million high risk children <6 years old. Our text message intervention is innovative because involves system-generated real time support, tailoring, feedback, and interactivity. Our study has theoretical significance because it integrates a testable theory with an intervention planning model to elucidate mechanisms of change at multiple levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Despite the fact that early childhood caries (ECC) is preventable, it is the most common chronic childhood disease in the US, affecting 28% of those aged 2-5, and disproportionately affecting poor and minority groups. We propose an interactive text messaging intervention delivered to parents of children younger than 6 years old, which aims to foster healthy parent behaviors and reduce ECC in their children. This novel, low cost approach has the potential to expand the ability of community health center (CHC) pediatric clinics to efficiently integrate oral health promotion into their practice and could easily be disseminated to the 1200 CHCs in the United States that treat 4.5 million children younger than 6, most of whom are at high risk for ECC.",Interactive Parent-targeted Text Messaging in Pediatric Clinics to Reduce ECC,9530844,UH3DE025492,"['Academy ', ' Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Budgets ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Feedback ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Fluorides ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health behavior ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Legal Guardians ', ' Lip structure ', ' Lip ', ' literacy ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Parents ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Textiles ', ' fabric ', ' Time ', ' tooth brushing ', ' Toothbrushing ', ' Toothpaste ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Lifting ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Oral ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 6 year old ', ' six years of age ', ' six year old ', ' age 6 years ', ' 6 years of age ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Evidence based program ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tailored messaging ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Cultural Sensitivity ', ' racial minority ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' income disparities ', ' ']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,UH3,2017,1199834,0.24642982468932573
"Complex Systems Science Approaches to Addressing Oral Health Disparities Oral health disparities, particularly among children, continue to be a pressing problem in the US. While the oral health of children has improved overall, those from disadvantaged population groups continue to suffer from a greater than average disease burden. Oral health disparities reflect a complex set of pathways and mechanisms with bidirectional associations (feedback loops) that traverse the macro- and micro-levels of disease causation. The overall goal of this proposal is to facilitate the candidate’s long term career goal of becoming an independent social epidemiologist capable of investigating disease causation and prevention through a complex systems-based perspective. The current proposal aims to provide the candidate with the opportunity to develop the necessary skills and experience to achieve research independence by extending their formal training in epidemiology and applied experiences in oral health disparities research. Development activities proposed during the mentored phase are related to training the candidate in Complex Systems Science (CSS) approaches, namely social network analysis (SNA) and agent-based modeling (ABM). Training will occur through coursework, multidisciplinary mentoring and applied research experiences. The primary vehicle for development is the research plan. The proposed research aims to use CSS approaches to better understand the factors and mechanisms underlying oral health among a disadvantaged population, and to improve the strategies aimed at improving oral health, thereby reducing observed disparities. These approaches facilitate an understanding of the population, social interaction and environmental influence simultaneously and can explore interactions, feedback loops and reciprocity between independent and dependent variables. The first phase of the proposed work aims to develop a detailed conceptual model of oral health disparities that captures the multi-level mechanisms and will be used to inform the development of an agent-based model. ABM refers to the use of stochastic computer simulations to understand how the distribution of health and disease on a population level emerge from explicitly programmed health behaviors, social interactions and movements of simulated individuals over simulated time. An ABM of oral health and social networks among residents of public housing will be developed and utilized to identify viable intervention targets. The second phase of the work proposes to conduct a longitudinal SNA of adult caregivers of young children residing in public housing. SNA is an empirical tool that has been utilized to better understand the social context within which individuals interact. The planned analysis will serve to provide longitudinal data that can be used to validate the estimates of intervention targets obtained from the agent-based model. Additionally, the feasibility and acceptability of a potential network-based intervention will be evaluated within the sample. Completion of the described aims will represent one of the first applications of complex systems science methods to oral health disparities and demarcate the independent research career of the candidate. The proposed research aims to address oral health disparities using complex systems science approaches. Oral health disparities reflect a complex set of pathways and mechanisms with bidirectional associations (feedback loops) that traverse the macro- and micro-levels of disease causation. Agent-based models and social network analysis will be used to better understand the factors and mechanisms underlying oral health disparities, and to improve the strategies aimed at reducing them.",Complex Systems Science Approaches to Addressing Oral Health Disparities,9319247,K99DE025917,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Boston ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computers ', ' Data Collection ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dissection ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Feedback ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Housing ', ' Investments ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Poverty ', ' Probability ', ' Public Housing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' member ', ' social movement ', ' Applied Research ', ' Applied Science ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' social ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Property ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Population Group ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Network-based ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' network models ', ' population health ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' ']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K99,2017,128010,0.2943674518402116
"Social Network Dynamics and Oral Health Disparities in Mexican American Immigrants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos in the US experience substantial oral health disparities (OHD). They face barriers to accessing oral health services (e.g., among the lowest rates of dental insurance among any racial or ethnic group), and are disproportionately less likely to seek regular and preventive dental care. Latino children and adults also experience higher rates of dental caries, gingivitis, and/or chronic periodontitis. Studies of oral health among Latinos have been limited to identifying individual-level socioeconomic and sociocultural mechanisms, with little attention to broader personal and community network contexts. Viewed from a network science perspective, the health behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes of individuals are shaped through contact and communication with others; there is a strong relationship between social networks and health outcomes. The current oral health research toolbox does not adequately capture the multiple nested levels of influence embodied in OHD. We propose to apply Social Network Analysis (SNA) methods to address the critical need to understand how social norms, attitudes, resources, and information around dental care and oral health propagate through personal and community networks, and affect individual behavior and outcomes. In the proposed research we will build on our completed formative project (NIDCR DE022096), a pioneer study using SNA methods in OHD research targeting people of Mexican descent (or Mexican-Americans [MAs]) in the US. In that prior cross-sectional design we characterized experiences about food, oral health behaviors, and dental care in the context of the networks they live in. Describing OHD factors and mechanisms affecting MAs has great public health significance because the MA sub-group makes up about 60% of Latinos in the US. In the present longitudinal design, we will develop a strong causal model of OHD by focusing on the dynamic processes underlying the coevolution of networks, oral health culture, and dental care attitudes and behaviors over time among MAs who have recently immigrated. Our specific aims are to: 1) characterize the norms, attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions of barriers around dental care and oral health among MA immigrants, with specific attention to associations between these factors and personal social network features; and 2) determine the relationships between acculturation, personal and community network dynamics, diffusion of norms and resources, and evolving oral health behaviors, attitudes, and outcomes over time among MA immigrants. Having additional, and more accurate knowledge about the complex and dynamic mechanisms underlying OHD will provide a foundation to develop four aspects: effective public policy, efficient clinical guidelines, culturally-sensitive clinical and preventive care, and futur research directions with practical applications. Moreover, drawing on the rich body of existing research on network interventions and diffusion of innovation from other health areas, our findings can be applied to tailoring programs that leverage the strengths and resources of MA communities to improve population oral health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Latino population - the largest and fastest growing ethnic group in the US - has significant barriers to dental services and is afflicted by large oral health disparities. Attempts to address such problems through individual behavior change have been largely unsuccessful because little is known about the complex network dimensions in which patterns of oral health self-care and dental services utilization take place. The proposed research will study one Latino community to trace relationships over time between acculturation, personal and community network dynamics, diffusion of norms and resources, and experiences of oral health, to yield a solid base for effective public policy and culturally-sensitive clinicalcare.",Social Network Dynamics and Oral Health Disparities in Mexican American Immigrants,9265827,R01DE025836,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' health attitude ', ' Attitude to Health ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Biology ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Diffusion ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Evolution ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gingivitis ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services ', ' Immigration ', ' Dental Insurance ', ' dental health insurance ', ' Periodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontia insurance ', ' Oral Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Surgery Insurance ', ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Oral Characters ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Perception ', ' Periodontitis ', ' Chronic Periodontitis ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Time ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Assimilations ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Mexican ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Community Networks ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' social ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Subgroup ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' service utilization ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' longitudinal design ', ' precision medicine ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' causal model ', ' causal diagram ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive dental care ', ' Preventive dental service ', ' Preventative dental service ', ' Preventative dental care ', ' ']",NIDCR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2017,1044030,0.292608069445997
"The representative microbiome: social determinants and tools for population research ﻿DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The structure and function of the vast array of microbial communities hosted by the human body (""microbiome"") is emerging as a novel contributor to variation in health outcomes. As links between the human microbiome and health emerge, population health approaches to understanding the social and environmental determinants of microbiome variation will be an important complement to microbiological and clinical research. Advances in massively parallel sequencing and computing now enable relatively low-cost characterization of the human microbiome in population-based studies. The Human Microbiome Project and MetaHIT project characterized the human microbiome among small groups of healthy volunteers, but neither of these projects used a representative population-based sample with a wide range of phenotypic variation, and the association of socioeconomic and demographic factors with microbiome composition is largely unknown. The human mouth harbors one of the most diverse microbial communities in the human body, which has been linked with both oral and systemic disease including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and pre-term birth. This study will establish the prevalence of oral microbiome characteristics and the associations of these characteristics with sociodemographic factors in a large, nationally representative sample from the 2009-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We will further examine the association of the oral microbiome with biomarkers of health risk that vary by SES and race/ethnicity including inflammation (C-reactive protein) and diabetes and pre-diabetes (fasting blood glucose and HbA1C%). Finally, the project will also build infrastructure for inter-disciplinary research in this emerging area by developing a publicly available, web- based interface and toolkit for population health researchers to easily incorporate microbiome data into their analysis. Understanding the social and life course determinants of the oral microbiome has the potential to lead to novel prevention strategies based upon environmental modification and manipulation of microbial ecology to reduce health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this study is to describe sociodemographic variation in the oral microbiome in a national population-based sample.

"Coordinated Oral Health Promotion (CO-OP) Chicago ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Almost half of children 11 years old and younger suffer from dental caries, making caries one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood. Low income and minority children bear a disproportionate portion of this burden. In Chicago, these disparities are obvious with 63% of Chicago-area 3rd-graders having dental caries and over half of these caries are untreated. Pediatric dental caries are associated with pain, more severe infections, malnutrition, speech difficulties, poor school performance, cosmetic problems, and an overall lower quality of life. While many oral health interventions have been developed to reduce the incidence of caries, even the most successful programs have limited effectiveness in high risk children. The delivery and receipt of proper preventive oral healthcare involves social and environmental factors that operate on individual, family, and community levels. Multi-level interventions recognize the need to target these levels simultaneously but multi-level oral health interventions for the primary prevention of dental caries are lacking. COordinated Oral health Promotion (CO-OP) Chicago brings together a team of clinical pediatricians and dentists, researchers, health psychologists, and policy experts to rigorously test the ability of an oral health promotion intervention to improve child and family oral health. The primary intervention is family-focused education and support from community health workers (CHWs); this intervention will be applied in a range of settings to determine which settings, or combination of settings, result in the best outcomes. The Aim of the UH2 Phase is to formalize partnerships and finalize study design and protocol. This includes: 1) A formative assessment to determine partner operations, resources, and needs; 2) CHW training; 3) Pilot testing of recruitment and intervention protocols; 4) Creation of a final Manual of Procedures; and 5) Obtain clearances/contracts from all institutional and community partners. The UH3 Phase then implements and evaluates the intervention in 15 clinics, 15 WIC sites, and 1520 individual families. Aim 1 is to evaluate the ability of a clinic-based family-focused CHW intervention to improve child oral health; Aim 2 evaluates the ability of a WIC-based family-focused CHW intervention to improve child oral health; Aim 3 evaluates the ability of a home-based family-focused CHW intervention to improve child oral health; and Aim 4 determines the added value of combining interventions. The hypothesis is that participants receiving home-based CHWs and clinic-based or WIC-based CHW interventions will have the best oral health outcomes at 12-months. The primary outcome is incidence of early childhood caries, determined by the Caries Severity Index. The study will also employ the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) to evaluate program effectiveness. The results of this study have the potential to influence oral health programming, workforce development, and reimbursement on the local, state, and national level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  COordinated Oral health Promotion (CO-OP) Chicago will test the impact of a family-focused community health worker intervention for oral health promotion when applied alone in clinical, WIC, and home settings, and when applied in combination.

"Dental Service Utilization for Foreign and Native-born Children in America Project Summary Children from immigrant families constitute one of the largest and fastest growing racial and ethnic minority population groups in the United States. Yet, immigrant children's oral health status, dental needs and dental service utilization are understudied and poorly understood. Few published studies on oral health of immigrant adults and children are based on convenience and small sample sizes or Medicaid data from a single state and all have provided mixed results. The specific characteristics within the foreign-born population that could explain any differential uptake in dental service utilization to address disparity is limited. In addition, existing literature on oral health disparities have focused on socioeconomic factors and do not include social and cultural determinants of oral health such as immigration status. This gap in knowledge specifically hampers the development and implementation of appropriate policies and programs that could achieve positive oral health outcomes for immigrant children. Immigrant oral health is influenced by individual, community and healthcare system factors both before and after immigration, yet it is unclear how these factors contribute to overall oral health disparities. Immigrant children's oral health is a growing dental public health concern due to the significant consequences of common oral diseases if left untreated. The overall goal of this project is to address the gap in knowledge related to immigrant children's oral health and to explore how immigrant children's oral health characteristics contribute to oral health disparities. In addition, this study will identify specific characteristics and health care level factors required for appropriate intervention to reduce these disparities. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to determine the patterns and time trend of dental services utilization and unmet dental needs of foreign-born children from 2002 to 2014; and (2) to examine the extent to which immigrant status factors such as length of stay, language spoken at home and other person-level demographic factors explain variations in dental access, utilization and unmet dental needs of foreign-born children compared to native-born children from 2002 to 2014. This project will be conducted by a team of multidisciplinary researchers using two nationally representative databases: the 2001-2013 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the 2002-2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Descriptive statistics will be conducted to provide estimates of counts and rates of dental services utilization and unmet dental needs. Logistic regression models will then be fit to determine outcome variables associated with other covariates. Structural equation modeling (SEM) will be used to describe the relationship between latent phenomena captured by multiple related variables, such as acculturation. Findings from this project will be used to inform the development of priorities and policies directed at immigrant children's oral health and oral health disparities.   Project Narrative Children from immigrant families are one of the fastest growing groups in the nation and their oral health contributes to overall health and health disparities. The individual and societal consequences of oral health disparities including inadequate access to dental care, are of immense concern to dental public health professionals. Dental public health professionals and stakeholders will use the findings from this project to develop appropriate intervention strategies including the formulation of appropriate local, state, and national priority and policy guidelines for immigrant children's oral health.  ",Dental Service Utilization for Foreign and Native-born Children in America,9374382,R03DE027159,"['demographics ', ' service utilization ', ' Formulation ', ' Preventive dental care ', ' Preventive dental service ', ' Preventative dental service ', ' Preventative dental care ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health seeking behavior ', ' Time trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Americas ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Communities ', ' Dental Care Delivery ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Exhibits ', ' Expenditure ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Services ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Immigration ', ' Dental Insurance ', ' dental health insurance ', ' Periodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontia insurance ', ' Oral Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Surgery Insurance ', ' Language ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Literature ', ' Medicaid ', ' Medicine ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Persons ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Parents ', ' Population Surveillance ', ' Public Health Surveillance ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Societies ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' dental disorder ', ' dental disease ', ' Tooth Disorder ', ' Tooth Diseases ', ' United States ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Native-Born ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' uptake ', ' Immigrant ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Equation ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Population Group ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' 18 year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' 18 years of age ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ']",NIDCR,MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY,R03,2017,170999,0.3145962834343139
"Evaluation of a daily oral care lozenge on oral health and quality of life in older adults Project Abstract By 2030, 70 million Americans will be over the age of 65. Currently, 70% of older adults have periodontal disease, 20% have untreated tooth decay, and 1 in 4 older adults have lost some or all of their teeth [25]. This poses a significant problem as mounting evidence demonstrates a link between oral disease and systemic life- threatening diseases, including premature death. Gum disease (inflammation and bleeding gums) is associated with systemic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, respiratory disorders, dementia and oral, throat and pancreatic cancers [11]. Moreover, numerous studies suggest that the number of teeth lost in adulthood is a predictor of premature death [12-23]. Therefore, an individual's oral health and general systemic health are tightly linked and good oral hygiene could be an easy means of preventing serious, life-threatening conditions in many older adults. The most significant driver of oral disease is dysbiosis, which is a disturbance in the balance that exists amongst the microbes in the mouth, wherein the burden of pathogens reaches disease-causing levels and the levels of health-promoting bacteria are too low to compensate. The most characterized oral pathogens include the cavity-causing Streptococcus mutans and the gum disease-associated P. gingivalis, T. denticola, and T. forsythia. We have identified a means of inhibiting the pathogenic metabolism of these bacterial pathogens through the use of a naturally safe GRAS ingredient combination, PTx800, which has been shown to: (i) inhibit pathogen growth while preserving health-promoting bacterial growth, (ii) block pathogen sugar metabolism and (iii) inhibit acid and (iv) plaque production in in vitro studies. Further studies in humans aged 6-58 confirmed the selective anti-pathogen effects of PTx800, while preserving Lactobacillus levels and improved oral pH balance in a sustained manner. For many older adults, decreased manual dexterity, physical or mental impairment, income constraints, lack of dental insurance, all contribute to and exacerbate oral disease. We believe we have a cost-effective, nontoxic and easy-to-take oral solution in PTx800 rapid dissolving lozenges. We propose to confirm our PTx800 pilot data and to evaluate its performance and ease of use in the older adult population who frequent elderly community centers in the greater Cleveland, Ohio area. We will assess the 3- and 6-week efficacy of PTx800 as a supplement to standard oral hygiene practices in a cohort of participants who have confirmed dental pathogens and clinical gingivitis, and compare the change in disease scores and pathogen burdens over time. As a part of the study design, we will also survey this population for perceptions, biases and habits as they relate to oral health, social and emotional wellbeing. The culmination of this work will enable us to better understand and address the oral health crisis in older adults, as well as to evaluate the impact our approach may have in improving quality of life for this demographic. Project Narrative By 2030, 70 million Americans will be over the age of 65. Currently, 70% of older adults have periodontal disease, 20% have untreated tooth decay, and 1 in 4 older adults have lost some or all of their teeth. This poses a significant problem as mounting evidence demonstrates a link between oral disease and systemic life- threatening disease, including premature death. This proposal focuses on evaluating the clinical disease impact of our oral care lozenge, previously shown to selectively decrease gum disease-causing bacteria while leaving health-promoting bacteria intact. We propose to explore its translation to the older adult population, with particular focus on vulnerable subpopulations with established health disparities. This work will also uncover perceptions, biases and dental hygiene practices for this demographic, as well as to establish the potential impact our approach may have in improving quality of life for

"Learning about Early Childhood Caries Prevention in a Latino Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed K99/R00 career development award application will support academic preparation and the initiation of an independent research career focused on multilevel factors associated with oral health using a strengths-based approach to reduce pediatric oral health disparities. The oral health of a child cannot be separated from family, community and the environment; thus it is vital to include a multilevel perspective in any comprehensive model of children's oral health. My research in the K99 phase will describe the maternal psychosocial and behavioral factors associated with ECC and also will describe the prevalence of dental caries in a sample of Latino children. Measures taken from the Basic Research Factors Questionnaire (BRFQ) will be used to describe psychosocial and behavioral factors (e.g., oral health locus of control, health beliefs, self- efficacy, Sense o Coherence, stress, importance of oral health, oral health knowledge and behaviors) in Latina mothers of preschool children in Denver, Colorado. The results of this study will be compared to that of a high-risk American Indian population in which similar measures from the BRFQ were used. During the R00 phase, a mixed methods approach will be used to describe the differences at child, family and community levels for caries-free and caries-active urban dwelling Latino children. This methodology will capture the factors measured by the BRFQ survey and then will use qualitative methods to further probe characteristics at each level. I will use asset mapping, which is one on the strengths-based approaches, to describe the protective health assets that enhance the ability of individuals, families, communities and social systems to maintain and sustain oral health and to help reduce oral health inequities in high risk and vulnerable groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research and training has three-fold relevance for public health. First, the award will promote to mentor and nurture a new investigator, who has a background in dentistry and public health and is committed to reducing oral health disparities in the United States. Second, this project will use a multidisciplinary and multi-method approach to describe the protective factors against early childhood caries in Latino children at individual, family and community level. Through this research we will be able to understand why some children, despite being at high risk for developing dental caries, remain caries-free. This will not only add essential and indispensable information to the literature but will guide other investigators in their research. Finally, this research will develop a conceptual outline for behavioral interventions based on the principles of strength based approaches in a community rather than based on pathological model.",Learning about Early Childhood Caries Prevention in a Latino Population,9420025,R00DE024758,"['American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' Preschool Child ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dentistry ', ' Dentists ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environment and Public Health ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Control Locus ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mothers ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Parents ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Distal ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' health knowledge ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Head Start ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' FIRST Award ', ' First Independent Research Support and Transition Awards ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' reservation-based ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Academic support ', ' academic preparation ', ' academic readiness ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' urban dwelling ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R00,2017,249000,0.31909119035797195
"Statewide implementation and evaluation of a rural, school-based, caries prevention program SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Our long term goal is to reduce oral health disparities in rural school children.  Our immediate goal is to test two new evidence-based, school-based, cavity prevention programs.  We will compare two preventions: (1) A newer, simpler, less expensive, efficient treatment using fluoride varnish + silver diamine fluoride; and (2) A more traditional, complex, expensive, time-intensive treatment that includes simple + sealants + interim therapeutic restorations. The simpler method takes 6 minutes to deliver, compared to the more complex method that takes 20 minutes. Therefore, if the simpler, less expensive is as effective as the more complex, more expensive method, the data could support clinical and policy change.  To compare the two methods we will use a cluster randomized control trial design. We will implement this program in rural New Hampshire schools. All children in a school with informed consent will receive the same treatment (either simple or complex). We will provide preventive care twice per year for the 5 year grant period.  We will follow all children longitudinally for five years to determine the effectiveness of each preventive method. The primary outcome to make this determination will be the percentage of children with untreated decay. This is one of the U.S. Healthy People oral health goals. We will also examine the cost and cost- effectiveness. This will allow us to determine the balance between effectiveness and cost.  Assessing effectiveness and costs is particularly important for reducing disparities. If an intervention is quick, inexpensive, and 100% effective, that is a relatively simple choice. Most interventions are not 100% effective. Therefore, information on time, expense, and effectiveness will allow us to make better informed clinical and policy decisions. Specifically, this will help us answer the question: How much of which preventive intervention will increase access, improve health, and reduce costs? Project Narrative  Dental cavities are world’s most prevalent disease. In the U.S., almost 4 in 10 rural schoolchildren have untreated cavities. To improve the health of children we will test two new school- based cavity prevention programs to see which works best.","Statewide implementation and evaluation of a rural, school-based, caries prevention program",9468971,R01MD011526,"['Primary Prevention ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Schools ', ' Silver ', ' Ag element ', ' Dental Societies ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' restoration ', ' elementary school ', ' grade school ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Monitor ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' implementation research ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' prevention efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' health equity ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Prevention trial ', ' trial design ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive measure ', ' Preventative measure ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' rural counties ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Sources ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dental Hygienists ', ' Dental Records ', ' Dentists ', ' Diamines ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Fluorides ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Planning ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Institutes ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' New Hampshire ', ' Nurses ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' ']",NIMHD,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,751427,0.1427255370948846
"Implementing a Participatory, Multi-level Intervention to Improve Asian American Health ABSTRACT Lack of access to oral health care contributes to profound and enduring oral health disparities in the United States and worldwide. Vulnerable and underserved populations who commonly lack access to oral health care include but are not limited to racial and ethnic minorities, including immigrants and non-English speakers. The Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) pre-doctoral standard 2-25 states: Dental education programs must make available opportunities and encourage students to engage in service learning experiences and/or community-based learning experiences. The New York University College of Dentistry (NYU Dentistry) aims to transcend this notable advance in dental education and build equitable partnerships with local community- based agencies, organizations, and institutions dedicated to improving the health and well-being of their constituents. Beyond the rewards of immersive learning experiences and the opportunity to improve the health of neighboring communities, our students and faculty will learn innovative local solutions from our partners. The 2011 report by the National Academies titled, Improving Access to Oral Health Care for Vulnerable and Underserved Populations is based on the following 2 well-established and evidence-based principles: (1) Oral health is an integral part of overall health and, therefore, oral health care is an essential component of comprehensive health care. (2) Oral health promotion and disease prevention are essential to any strategies aimed at improving access to care. Our long-term goal is to improve Asian American health. The current project will make a vital contribution by using well-established public health (CBPR, ecological models) and implementation science [Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), Implementation Outcomes Framework (IOF)] approaches in Chinese American partnering sites to achieve 3 specific aims: Aim 1: To use the remote capability of the axiUm Dental Software at NYU Dentistry to enter patient information at community sites into its electronic health record (EHR) system, thus enabling: tracking at the community, site, provider, and patient levels of receipt of oral health care visits, services, and health outcomes; evaluation of implementation effectiveness; and integration with the Epic EHR system at NYU Langone Medical Center. Aim 2: To compare the effectiveness of 2 multi-level interventions to improve oral health for Chinese adults:  (A) EHR enhanced community outreach providing dental screening, health promotion, and incentives;  (B) Partnered EHR enhanced community outreach providing written agreements of collaboration for  dental screening, health promotion, and incentives; culturally-tailored and language-specific adaptation  of materials; demonstrations with role-playing of proper brushing with fluoride toothpaste and flossing  techniques; and CHW follow-up with patients of oral health care receipt and dental hygiene behaviors. Aim 3: To model the knowledge gained about factors at the community, site, provider, family, and patient levels to enhance community- and clinic-based oral health service delivery and improve health outcomes. NARRATIVE This project will use a participatory, multi-level approach to enhance community- and clinic-based oral health service delivery and improve health outcomes for Asian Americans.","Implementing a Participatory, Multi-level Intervention to Improve Asian American Health",9439350,U56DE027447,"['Academy ', ' Accreditation ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' American Dental Association ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Behavior ', ' Buffaloes ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Chinese American ', ' Communities ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' comprehensive care ', ' Comprehensive Healthcare ', ' Comprehensive Health Care ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Dentistry ', ' dentistry education ', ' Dental Education ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Fluorides ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Health Resources ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Immersion Investigative Technique ', ' Immersion ', ' Incentives ', ' Information Sciences ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Methodology ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Role playing therapy ', ' Role Playing ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Students ', ' tooth brushing ', ' Toothbrushing ', ' Toothpaste ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Social Network ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Evaluation ', ' Dental ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Transcend ', ' Visit ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' care seeking ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Agreement ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Health Care Visit ', ' Healthcare Visit ', ' Improve Access ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' oral care ', ' implementation research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' implementation science ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' model building ', ' service learning ', ' service-based learning ', ' racial minority ', ' Health Care Research ', ' healthcare research ', ' ']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,U56,2017,254210,0.30171750707240247
"Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia ABSTRACT  Oral disease, in particular childhood caries, remains a major health burden which affects some communities disproportionally, including regions of Appalachia. Both increased sugar intake and frequency of exposure alter the oral microbial community, triggering a disease process that leads to caries. Additional factors associated with caries in children include genetic risk, household SES, maternal caregiving behavior and stress, access to care. Progress has been made in understanding many of these factors. However, much remains to be done in order to further characterize individual risk factors, but just as importantly, to determine how interactions between them lead to oral health disparities.  The current proposal is a renewal of our ongoing project (R01-DE-014899) to identify factors contributing to the oral health disparity seen in northern Appalachia. The guiding philosophy of our project (the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia; COHRA) has been and continues to be that developing strategies to address this disparity requires simultaneous study of multiple risk components (ideally within families) to determine their roles, interactions among them, and their transmissibility patterns. COHRA's long- term goal remains to determine the sources of oral health disparity in a high risk, Northern Appalachian population so that effective preventive interventions can be designed and targeted.  During the previous project period that began Sept 1, 2009, we recruited a cohort of approximately 1000 northern Appalachian women during pregnancy (COHRA2), following them and their children through their children's second birthday. This prospective study of mother-child pairs complements the original cohort of approximately 840 northern Appalachian families (COHRA1) by gathering multifaceted, longitudinal data on the earliest antecedents of caries formation. As detailed in the progress report, the specific aims of the previous project period (using both COHRA1 and COHRA2 cohorts) were all accomplished (recruitment targets, genetic analyses of the COHRA1 cohort, psychosocial investigations, microbial assessments). We propose to follow the current COHRA2 cohort as it grows from ages 2 to 6, and to use the resulting longitudinal demographic, medical, diet, and psychosocial data to test hypotheses about the causal relationships between risk factors contributing to the unusually high rates of caries formation in this population. We will integrate the additional data to be collected with existing and new genetic and microbial data to identify “cariogenic profiles,” in which the interactions between mother and child genetics, oral ecology, diet, and other environmental/psychosocial behaviors in infancy and early childhood are combined to predict unusually high risks for onset of caries before age 6. NARRATIVE Oral disease, in particular childhood caries, remains a major health burden which affects some communities disproportionally, including regions of Appalachia. The goal of the requested competing continuation remains to determine the factors leading to oral health disparity in children followed up to age 6 from a high risk, Northern Appalachian population.",Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia,9554179,R01DE014899,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Appalachian ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Behavior ', ' Beverages ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Household ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mining ', ' Mothers ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Phenotype ', ' Philosophy ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Woman ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Natural History ', ' Medical ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Oral ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Viral ', ' psychosocial ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' maternal stress ', ' stressed mothers ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' Modeling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' early onset ', ' antimicrobial peptide ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' microbial community ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' high risk ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' maternal caregiving ', ' maternal care giving ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,985515,0.27427076199661
"Developing an Oral Health Behavior Social Support Scale for Mexican-origin Adults Project Summary Nationwide, Mexican-American adults over age 30 have the highest prevalence of periodontal disease of all racial/ethnic groups (67% vs. 43% fornon-Hispanic Whites)(Eke, Dye et al. 2015). Poor oral hygiene is one risk factor for this common, preventable disease. However, few interventions focus on improving oral hygiene in this high-risk group, many of whom are also low-income and lack access to dental care. Social support has been targeted successfully in social and behavioral interventions to improve dietary behaviors, physical activity, and chronic disease management among Mexican-origin adults, but it has not been studied extensively in an oral health context. In addition, the role of social support differs for men and women with other health behaviors, supporting the need to study differences between men and women. This study addresses these gaps by developing a bilingual (English/Spanish) oral health behavior-specific social support scale for use in future intervention research. Developing such a measure will enable more precise assessment of the role and perceived impact of different sources and types of social support on daily hygiene behavior, dental care utilization, and oral health outcomes. Our experienced, multi-disciplinary team proposes a two-phase mixed methods study that will: 1) qualitatively explore the relevant social influences on oral health behavior for lower income Mexican-origin young adult men and women to understand structural and functional aspects of social support; 2) develop and pilot test an oral health behavior-specific social support scale, and 3) quantitatively assess the scale’s psychometric properties and association with oral health status and behavior. Phase I proposes semi-structured interviews with 25-40 men and 25-40 women from the target population of Mexican- origin young adults, to explore dimensions of social support in an oral health context as part of scale item generation and refinement. Cognitive interviews will be conducted to assess scale content and understanding of item and response option wording and order of the draft scale with 40 different adults from the target population, before it is piloted with 200 adults. Phase II will quantitatively validate the scale. Surveys will be conducted with 500 men and women, and a subset of >250 will also receive a dental exam. Phase II analysis will include cluster and factor analysis of the new social support scale, calculate the Cronbach’s alpha to assess internal consistency, and assess scale and subscale validity (content, face, construct, concurrent, divergent, and discriminant validity) and reliability. Sex-stratified analyses will examine associations with self-reported oral hygiene behavior (brushing, flossing, rinsing), dental care utilization, multiple self-rated oral health status indices, and clinically-assessed oral health status (tooth loss; caries; periodontal disease).

"Good Oral Health: a Bi-level Intervention to Improve Older Adult Oral Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application will extend a successful NIDCR-funded bi-level oral health self-management pilot conducted among older/disabled adults residing in one older adult residential building to six buildings and evaluate it using a modified fractional factorial design. The theoretical framework is based on Fishbein's modified theory of reasoned action called the Integrated Model (IM) of Behavioral Prediction. It is operationalized through Adapted Motivational Interviewing, an interactive tailored cognitive approach, and Practice-to-Mastery (AMI-PM). The intervention includes two components: 1) a face to face administration of the AMI-PM; and 2) a targeted building-level campaign that includes principles of practice to master (CA-PM). The specific aims are to: 1) Test the two main components of a bi-level intervention to improve clinical oral hygiene outcomes in relation to one another, and through differential sequencing. 2) Identify cognitive and behavioral mechanisms contributing to clinical oral hygiene outcomes. 3) Assess impact and sustainability of behavioral and clinical outcomes over time. The intervention will be carried out in three cycles of 150 participants each for a total of N=450. Each cycle will include two buildings matched by size and ethnic/linguistic composition housing older adults and those with disabilities. In one condition, the individual leve intervention will be introduced followed by the group level intervention. In the second condition, the group level intervention will precede the individual level. Survey and clinical measures taken at baseline, and following the administration of the first and second components. This design will enable comparison of the short term efficacy of the individual versus group level component (T1 - T2) and the shorter and longer term efficacy of the interventions (T3 - 3 months). Clinical measures at T4, 6 months later, will evaluate sustainability of effect. Primary outcome measures are gingival index and plaque score, both of which improved significantly in the pilot study. Significance lies in the potential of the intervention to address critical disparities in oral healh through oral health promotion initiatives in the locations where they reside as well as the ability to evaluate the intervention efficiently using a design alternative to the RCT. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study's primary significance lies in the potential of this bi-level intervention to address significant disparities in oral health and consequent morbidity or reduced quality of life among vulnerable, low-income and primarily minority older adults and those with disabilities through prevention in the locations where they reside.

"Sensory Adapted Dental Environments to Enhance Oral Care for Children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, which builds upon our previous R34 NIDCR Planning and Feasibility study, is designed to examine the efficacy of a sensory adapted dental environment (SADE) to enhance children's oral care. Two groups will be studied: children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and typically developing (TD) children. Children with ASD, and a subset of TD children, exhibit sensory over-responsivity when confronted with experiential aspects of dental visits such as exposure to bright fluorescent lighting, touch in or around the mouth, or the texture and smell of various oral care products. This often results in increased anxiety and negative behavioral responses, which hinder the dentist's ability to perform treatment. In the proposed project, we test a SADE intervention designed to reduce children's anxiety and negative responses during oral care. The SADE intervention includes adaptations such as dimmed lighting, moving projections on the ceiling (fish, bubbles), exposure to soothing music, and application of a butterfly vest with wings that wrap around the child to provide calming sensations.  The specific aims are to conduct a randomized clinical trial in order to: 1. Determine if SADE, relative to a regular dental environment (RDE), reduces physiological anxiety and negative responses (behavioral distress, perception of pain, sensory discomfort) during dental cleaning for children with ASD and TD children and test whether SADE's effect is greater for the ASD group. 2. Identify whether physiological anxiety mediates the beneficial effects of the intervention and whether severity of ASD and communication ability (ASD group), or dental anxiety, sensory over-responsivity, and age (both groups) act as moderating variables. 3. Assess the quality of care and cost effectiveness/savings of the dental cleaning associated with SADE.  Research participants will be 220 ethnically diverse children aged 6-12 years, 110 with ASD and 110 TD. Using a randomized counterbalanced study design, each child will undergo two dental cleanings four months apart: one dental cleaning in RDE and one dental cleaning in SADE.  This project is significant because it is the first full-scale trial of an intervention designed to reduce oral care problems in children with ASD. It is theoretically important because it will elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the effects of the SADE intervention and help to identify which subgroups of children, both TD and with ASD, which will benefit most from this approach. Based on the study findings, we will develop a model to transform the standard of pediatric dental care by modifying the sensory qualities of the dental environment; this model will have the potential to be utilized in dental clinics worldwide. As such the project promises to have a major public health impact insofar as the potential gains in oral health, child comfort, and cost-savings will be dramatic, potentially applying to more than one-fourth of all children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), as well as many typically developing children, exhibit sensory over-responsivity in response to the bright lights, sounds, and touch at the dental office, making dental care challenging for such populations. In this study we will test an intervention that alters the sensory characteristics of he dental environment in order to decrease children's physiological anxiety and negative responses during oral care and contribute to increased child comfort as well as safer, more efficient, and less costly treatment. If successful, this intervention has the potential to revolutionize clinic-based dental care for the growing population of children with ASD, as well as for typically developing children with dental anxiety and/or sensory over-responsivity.",Sensory Adapted Dental Environments to Enhance Oral Care for Children,9262201,U01DE024978,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' General Anesthesia ', ' Anxiety ', ' Butterflies ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Care ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Clinics ', ' Dental Offices ', ' Dentists ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fishes ', ' Goals ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Music ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Savings ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Smell Perception ', ' olfactory perception ', ' odor perception ', ' Smell ', ' Olfaction ', ' sound ', ' Taste Perception ', ' taste response ', ' taste processing ', ' gustatory response ', ' gustatory processing ', ' gustatory perception ', ' Taste ', ' Gustation ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Wing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Odontophobia ', ' Dental Phobia ', ' Dental Fear ', ' Dental Anxiety ', ' Cost Savings ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Dental ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Visual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Cross-Over Designs ', ' Crossover Design ', ' Exposure to ', ' Sedation procedure ', ' sedation ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Tactile ', ' Auditory ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Reaction ', ' Sensory ', ' Texture ', ' Visit ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Touch sensation ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' U-Series Cooperative Agreements ', ' Cooperative Agreements ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' oral care ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' successful intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2017,1061389,0.1820503375774249
"Genetic Architecture of Dental Caries of the Permanent Dentition PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Dental caries is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide, and despite progress in dis- ease prevention in the last 50 years, it continues to be a major public health problem. In the United States, dental caries affects more than 90% of adults, and its treatment is expensive, comprising the majority of dental health care costs (i.e., estimated $50-100 billion annually). Unfortunately, these ex- penditures are concentrated in a caries management paradigm of surgical restoration or extraction, which treats the symptoms of dental caries, while ignoring the root causes of disease. This approach disadvantages those with socioeconomic, geographic, or logistical barriers to accessing routine den- tal care. In fact, socioeconomic and racial differences in disease burden are so extreme that dental caries has become a focal issue in efforts to reduce public health disparities for the NIDCR. In order to shift the caries management paradigm to a model of risk assessment, early intervention, and recur- rence prevention, the etiological factors controlling caries susceptibility will need to be identified. Our project seeks to fill this need, focusing on the genetic factors contributing to disease and applying in- novative statistical methods of modeling dental caries experience. Indeed, studies shown that up to 60% of variation in caries experience may be attributed to host genetics; however, little is presently known about the specific genetic variants that contribute to cariogenesis. This proposal seeks to fill the gap in knowledge regarding the genetic factors leading to dental caries by modeling the patterns of caries across the dentition and conducting gene-mapping analyses. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will provide much-needed understanding of the environmental and genetic risk factors of dental caries. Ultimately, understanding the contributing factors to dental caries may lead to new interventions, better risk assessment, earlier detection, and recurrence prevention, and may inform public policy

"Multi-Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in Primary Care Settings ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Northeast Ohio has one of the highest rates of untreated cavities among poor and minority <6 yr old children. While the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommend adoption of oral health assessment within the primary care setting for children up to 6 yrs old, the evidence for such activities have been poor or lacking. Primary care clinicians can play an important role in communicating oral health (OH) facts to parent/caregivers at well-child visits (WCV) to reduce disparities in dental care access. Childhood caries is multifactorial in origin, but evidence suggests that innovative theory-driven interventions have not targeted determinants at the child-parent, provider (physician), practice/organization levels. The intervention mapping framework was used to develop the multi-level interventions: Parent: improve perception and skills - a common-sense model of self-regulation (CSM)-based OH facts letter + dental information guide (DIG); Provider (Physician): improve knowledge and skills -CSM-based education and skills, communicate OH facts, provide prescription to go to dentist; Practice (Pediatric): quality improvement -integrate systematic EMR documentation of OH, practice-tailored facilitation. A cluster-randomized clinical trial with a hybrid design is proposed to test behavioral (parent, provider) and implementation (practice) intervention to increase dental attendance among low-income children. Twenty pediatric practices will be utilized for the following primary aims: 1) UH2, Conduct formative work through community engagement and pilot-testing of the interventions and protocols in 2 practices; UH3, randomize 18 practices to four arms to investigate: 2) effect of bundled (parent + provider + practice level) interventions vs. enhanced usual care; 3) effect of behavioral and implementation components of the intervention. Secondary aims (UH3) are: assess effectiveness of interventions on secondary outcomes (new decay, oral hygiene, OHRQL, frequency of sweet snacks and beverages, cost); assess potential mediators and moderators to investigate pathways; assess adoption, reach, fidelity, maintenance measures. The sample includes 88 providers and 1584 parent/caregivers (of Medicaid- enrolled 3-6 year old children). Data analysis (UH2) will utilize a mixed method design for qualitative and descriptive/analytical statistics for quantitative data resulting from focus groups, interviews, and pilot-testing. Data collection (UH3) will follow the RE-AIM framework: child (primary, secondary outcomes from dental screening/Medicaid claims); parent, provider, practice (mediators, moderators from questionnaires); provider, practice (fidelity and implementation measures from audits). Generalized linear mixed effects models will assess effects of multi-level interventions on dental attendance and other outcomes, while accounting for clustering within family, provider and practice. Secondarily, mediation methods, accompanied by sensitivity analyses, will determine if intervention effects occur through hypothesized mediators. A comprehensive and innovative scalable oral health care model is proposed for widespread use by front-line primary care clinicians. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will test innovative theory-driven multi-level interventions at the parent/caregiver, provider (physician), practice (pediatric) levels to increas dental attendance and reduce untreated caries among 3 to 6 year old Medicaid-enrolled children attending well-child visits in the pediatrician's offices. The behavioral interventions at the parent and provider levels, and implementation strategies at the practice level will help parent to seek dental care for child. These novel interventions have the potential for a new oral health care model for physicians providing care for young children.",Multi-Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in Primary Care

"Coordinated Oral Health Promotion (CO-OP) Chicago ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Almost half of children 11 years old and younger suffer from dental caries, making caries one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood. Low income and minority children bear a disproportionate portion of this burden. In Chicago, these disparities are obvious with 63% of Chicago-area 3rd-graders having dental caries and over half of these caries are untreated. Pediatric dental caries are associated with pain, more severe infections, malnutrition, speech difficulties, poor school performance, cosmetic problems, and an overall lower quality of life. While many oral health interventions have been developed to reduce the incidence of caries, even the most successful programs have limited effectiveness in high risk children. The delivery and receipt of proper preventive oral healthcare involves social and environmental factors that operate on individual, family, and community levels. Multi-level interventions recognize the need to target these levels simultaneously but multi-level oral health interventions for the primary prevention of dental caries are lacking. COordinated Oral health Promotion (CO-OP) Chicago brings together a team of clinical pediatricians and dentists, researchers, health psychologists, and policy experts to rigorously test the ability of an oral health promotion intervention to improve child and family oral health. The primary intervention is family-focused education and support from community health workers (CHWs); this intervention will be applied in a range of settings to determine which settings, or combination of settings, result in the best outcomes. The Aim of the UH2 Phase is to formalize partnerships and finalize study design and protocol. This includes: 1) A formative assessment to determine partner operations, resources, and needs; 2) CHW training; 3) Pilot testing of recruitment and intervention protocols; 4) Creation of a final Manual of Procedures; and 5) Obtain clearances/contracts from all institutional and community partners. The UH3 Phase then implements and evaluates the intervention in 15 clinics, 15 WIC sites, and 1520 individual families. Aim 1 is to evaluate the ability of a clinic-based family-focused CHW intervention to improve child oral health; Aim 2 evaluates the ability of a WIC-based family-focused CHW intervention to improve child oral health; Aim 3 evaluates the ability of a home-based family-focused CHW intervention to improve child oral health; and Aim 4 determines the added value of combining interventions. The hypothesis is that participants receiving home-based CHWs and clinic-based or WIC-based CHW interventions will have the best oral health outcomes at 12-months. The primary outcome is incidence of early childhood caries, determined by the Caries Severity Index. The study will also employ the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) to evaluate program effectiveness.

"Multi-Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in Primary Care Settings ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Northeast Ohio has one of the highest rates of untreated cavities among poor and minority <6 yr old children. While the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommend adoption of oral health assessment within the primary care setting for children up to 6 yrs old, the evidence for such activities have been poor or lacking. Primary care clinicians can play an important role in communicating oral health (OH) facts to parent/caregivers at well-child visits (WCV) to reduce disparities in dental care access. Childhood caries is multifactorial in origin, but evidence suggests that innovative theory-driven interventions have not targeted determinants at the child-parent, provider (physician), practice/organization levels. The intervention mapping framework was used to develop the multi-level interventions: Parent: improve perception and skills - a common-sense model of self-regulation (CSM)-based OH facts letter + dental information guide (DIG); Provider (Physician): improve knowledge and skills -CSM-based education and skills, communicate OH facts, provide prescription to go to dentist; Practice (Pediatric): quality improvement -integrate systematic EMR documentation of OH, practice-tailored facilitation. A cluster-randomized clinical trial with a hybrid design is proposed to test behavioral (parent, provider) and implementation (practice) intervention to increase dental attendance among low-income children. Twenty pediatric practices will be utilized for the following primary aims: 1) UH2, Conduct formative work through community engagement and pilot-testing of the interventions and protocols in 2 practices; UH3, randomize 18 practices to four arms to investigate: 2) effect of bundled (parent + provider + practice level) interventions vs. enhanced usual care; 3) effect of behavioral and implementation components of the intervention. Secondary aims (UH3) are: assess effectiveness of interventions on secondary outcomes (new decay, oral hygiene, OHRQL, frequency of sweet snacks and beverages, cost); assess potential mediators and moderators to investigate pathways; assess adoption, reach, fidelity, maintenance measures. The sample includes 88 providers and 1584 parent/caregivers (of Medicaid- enrolled 3-6 year old children). Data analysis (UH2) will utilize a mixed method design for qualitative and descriptive/analytical statistics for quantitative data resulting from focus groups, interviews, and pilot-testing. Data collection (UH3) will follow the RE-AIM framework: child (primary, secondary outcomes from dental screening/Medicaid claims); parent, provider, practice (mediators, moderators from questionnaires); provider, practice (fidelity and implementation measures from audits). Generalized linear mixed effects models will assess effects of multi-level interventions on dental attendance and other outcomes, while accounting for clustering within family, provider and practice. Secondarily, mediation methods, accompanied by sensitivity analyses, will determine if intervention effects occur through hypothesized mediators. A comprehensive and innovative scalable oral health care model is proposed for widespread use by front-line primary care clinicians. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will test innovative theory-driven multi-level interventions at the parent/caregiver, provider (physician), practice (pediatric) levels to increas dental attendance and reduce untreated caries among 3 to 6 year old Medicaid-enrolled children attending well-child visits in the pediatrician's offices. The behavioral interventions at the parent and provider levels, and implementation strategies at the practice level will help parent to seek dental care for child. These novel interventions have the potential for a new oral health care model for physicians providing care for young children.",Multi-Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in Primary Care

"Social networks and oral health-related risk behaviors in public housing communities Social influences are important in the causes of oral health disparities and to changing health-related behaviors in disadvantaged populations. Conceptual models of children’s oral health include dynamic social pathways and the key role of caregivers’ knowledge, attitudes and behaviors. There is a critical lack of information about these pathways, particularly how social influences shape knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to oral health.  We propose to conduct a longitudinal sociometric network analysis among residents of public housing to better understand the factors that affect oral health-related risk behaviors. Although network science is relatively new to oral health disparities research, it is a well-established tool in other areas of health research. Understanding the role of social influences on the initiation and progression of oral disease is critical to the development, testing and implementation of effective behavioral interventions.  Our rationale is that by using network science to measure social interactions in a community, we will be able to define social network pathways that influence the risk-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviors that are associated with oral disease. Using knowledge about social influence that is gained from our research, future interventions may be tested and implemented that will prevent and reduce oral disease for those most at risk for oral disease.  Our specific aims are to: (1) Recruit and enroll a community of public housing residents to evaluate the structural properties of their social networks relevant to oral health risk-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviors at baseline and at 9- month intervals over two time points,  (2) Identify and quantify the exogenous and endogenous factors associated with the observed network structures and,  (3) Determine the association between the composition and structure of networks and oral health risk-related knowledge, attitudes and/or behaviors over time.  Public housing residents are a high impact, high-reward population for the study of oral health disparities because they involve spatial clustering of poverty and poor health. This produces a unique social climate and associated stigma for study that is not seen in other disadvantaged communities.  Our research will study network systems that influence social behaviors that are associated with oral disease and health disparities. Findings from our proposed observational study of public housing communities will help to inform the design of interventions that respond to the complex system dynamics of populations affected by health disparities. Oral health disparities, particularly among children, continue to be a pressing problem in the United States. Traditional approaches to the study of oral health disparities have failed to account for the multi-level factors that influence behavior, resulting in partial understanding of why oral health disparities persist and interventions fail to produce meaningful results. This project will use a systems science approach to better understand the factors affecting the oral health of public housing residents.",Social networks and oral health-related risk behaviors in public housing communities,9577055,R01DE027985,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Boston ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Housing ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' interpersonal relationship ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Housing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Development ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Measurement ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' System ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Diet and Nutrition ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Endogenous Factors ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Exogenous Factors ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' high reward ', ' population health ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2018,799826,0.29708975336503424
"Sensory Adapted Dental Environments to Enhance Oral Care for Children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, which builds upon our previous R34 NIDCR Planning and Feasibility study, is designed to examine the efficacy of a sensory adapted dental environment (SADE) to enhance children's oral care. Two groups will be studied: children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and typically developing (TD) children. Children with ASD, and a subset of TD children, exhibit sensory over-responsivity when confronted with experiential aspects of dental visits such as exposure to bright fluorescent lighting, touch in or around the mouth, or the texture and smell of various oral care products. This often results in increased anxiety and negative behavioral responses, which hinder the dentist's ability to perform treatment. In the proposed project, we test a SADE intervention designed to reduce children's anxiety and negative responses during oral care. The SADE intervention includes adaptations such as dimmed lighting, moving projections on the ceiling (fish, bubbles), exposure to soothing music, and application of a butterfly vest with wings that wrap around the child to provide calming sensations.  The specific aims are to conduct a randomized clinical trial in order to: 1. Determine if SADE, relative to a regular dental environment (RDE), reduces physiological anxiety and negative responses (behavioral distress, perception of pain, sensory discomfort) during dental cleaning for children with ASD and TD children and test whether SADE's effect is greater for the ASD group. 2. Identify whether physiological anxiety mediates the beneficial effects of the intervention and whether severity of ASD and communication ability (ASD group), or dental anxiety, sensory over-responsivity, and age (both groups) act as moderating variables. 3. Assess the quality of care and cost effectiveness/savings of the dental cleaning associated with SADE.  Research participants will be 220 ethnically diverse children aged 6-12 years, 110 with ASD and 110 TD. Using a randomized counterbalanced study design, each child will undergo two dental cleanings four months apart: one dental cleaning in RDE and one dental cleaning in SADE.  This project is significant because it is the first full-scale trial of an intervention designed to reduce oral care problems in children with ASD. It is theoretically important because it will elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the effects of the SADE intervention and help to identify which subgroups of children, both TD and with ASD, which will benefit most from this approach. Based on the study findings, we will develop a model to transform the standard of pediatric dental care by modifying the sensory qualities of the dental environment; this model will have the potential to be utilized in dental clinics worldwide. As such the project promises to have a major public health impact insofar as the potential gains in oral health, child comfort, and cost-savings will be dramatic, potentially applying to more than one-fourth of all children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), as well as many typically developing children, exhibit sensory over-responsivity in response to the bright lights, sounds, and touch at the dental office, making dental care challenging for such populations. In this study we will test an intervention that alters the sensory characteristics of he dental environment in order to decrease children's physiological anxiety and negative responses during oral care and contribute to increased child comfort as well as safer, more efficient, and less costly treatment. If successful, this intervention has the potential to revolutionize clinic-based dental care for the growing population of children with ASD, as well as for typically developing children with dental anxiety and/or sensory over-responsivity.",Sensory Adapted Dental Environments to Enhance Oral Care for Children,9483296,U01DE024978,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' General Anesthesia ', ' Anxiety ', ' Butterflies ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Clinics ', ' Dental Offices ', ' Dentists ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fishes ', ' Goals ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Music ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Savings ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Smell Perception ', ' olfactory perception ', ' odor perception ', ' Smell ', ' Olfaction ', ' sound ', ' Taste Perception ', ' taste response ', ' taste processing ', ' gustatory response ', ' gustatory processing ', ' gustatory perception ', ' Taste ', ' Gustation ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Wing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dental Anxiety ', ' Odontophobia ', ' Dental Phobia ', ' Dental Fear ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Dental ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Visual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Cross-Over Designs ', ' Crossover Design ', ' Exposure to ', ' Sedation procedure ', ' sedation ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Tactile ', ' Auditory ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Reaction ', ' Sensory ', ' Texture ', ' Visit ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Touch sensation ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' U-Series Cooperative Agreements ', ' Cooperative Agreements ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' oral care ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' application in practice ', ' practical application ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' successful intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral response ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' pain perception ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2018,1123517,0.1820503375774249
"Social Network Dynamics and Oral Health Disparities in Mexican American Immigrants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos in the US experience substantial oral health disparities (OHD). They face barriers to accessing oral health services (e.g., among the lowest rates of dental insurance among any racial or ethnic group), and are disproportionately less likely to seek regular and preventive dental care. Latino children and adults also experience higher rates of dental caries, gingivitis, and/or chronic periodontitis. Studies of oral health among Latinos have been limited to identifying individual-level socioeconomic and sociocultural mechanisms, with little attention to broader personal and community network contexts. Viewed from a network science perspective, the health behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes of individuals are shaped through contact and communication with others; there is a strong relationship between social networks and health outcomes. The current oral health research toolbox does not adequately capture the multiple nested levels of influence embodied in OHD. We propose to apply Social Network Analysis (SNA) methods to address the critical need to understand how social norms, attitudes, resources, and information around dental care and oral health propagate through personal and community networks, and affect individual behavior and outcomes. In the proposed research we will build on our completed formative project (NIDCR DE022096), a pioneer study using SNA methods in OHD research targeting people of Mexican descent (or Mexican-Americans [MAs]) in the US. In that prior cross-sectional design we characterized experiences about food, oral health behaviors, and dental care in the context of the networks they live in. Describing OHD factors and mechanisms affecting MAs has great public health significance because the MA sub-group makes up about 60% of Latinos in the US. In the present longitudinal design, we will develop a strong causal model of OHD by focusing on the dynamic processes underlying the coevolution of networks, oral health culture, and dental care attitudes and behaviors over time among MAs who have recently immigrated. Our specific aims are to: 1) characterize the norms, attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions of barriers around dental care and oral health among MA immigrants, with specific attention to associations between these factors and personal social network features; and 2) determine the relationships between acculturation, personal and community network dynamics, diffusion of norms and resources, and evolving oral health behaviors, attitudes, and outcomes over time among MA immigrants. Having additional, and more accurate knowledge about the complex and dynamic mechanisms underlying OHD will provide a foundation to develop four aspects: effective public policy, efficient clinical guidelines, culturally-sensitive clinical and preventive care, and futur research directions with practical applications. Moreover, drawing on the rich body of existing research on network interventions and diffusion of innovation from other health areas, our findings can be applied to tailoring programs that leverage the strengths and resources of MA communities to improve population oral health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Latino population - the largest and fastest growing ethnic group in the US - has significant barriers to dental services and is afflicted by large oral health disparities. Attempts to address such problems through individual behavior change have been largely unsuccessful because little is known about the complex network dimensions in which patterns of oral health self-care and dental services utilization take place. The proposed research will study one Latino community to trace relationships over time between acculturation, personal and community network dynamics, diffusion of norms and resources, and experiences of oral health, to yield a solid base for effective public policy and culturally-sensitive clinicalcare.",Social Network Dynamics and Oral Health Disparities in Mexican American Immigrants,9442770,R01DE025836,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Attitude to Health ', ' health attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Biology ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Diffusion ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Evolution ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gingivitis ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services ', ' Immigration ', ' Dental Insurance ', ' dental health insurance ', ' Periodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontia insurance ', ' Oral Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Surgery Insurance ', ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Oral Characters ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Perception ', ' Periodontitis ', ' Chronic Periodontitis ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Assimilations ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Mexican ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Community Networks ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' social ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Subgroup ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' application in practice ', ' practical application ', ' service utilization ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' longitudinal design ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' causal diagram ', ' causal model ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventive dental service ', ' Preventative dental service ', ' Preventative dental care ', ' Preventive dental care ', ' ']",NIDCR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2018,1244539,0.292608069445997
"Developing a Tailored, Web-delivered, Motivational Interviewing-based Intervention to Promote Oral Health To address a persistent “silent epidemic” of oral diseases in the United States and reduce associated health disparities, a new paradigm for promoting oral health behavior change is urgently needed. Patient education and risk-reduction counseling have been identified as central components of an overall plan for preventing oral disease. However, the typical approach of dental professionals is to provide oral hygiene advice, demonstration, or instruction, which generally have little impact on behavior. Although motivational interviewing (MI) has received support as a method for promoting oral health behavior change, constraints in dental practice settings limit the practicality of such counseling. As a step toward developing novel, effective, high-impact approaches to promoting behaviors that reduce risks for oral disease, the present application proposes a mixed methods research project to develop a web-delivered adaptation of MI for increasing patients' health-promoting behavior (e.g., oral hygiene) and decreasing their health-risk behavior (e.g. tobacco and other substance use). This program would be the first technology-delivered adaptation of MI to be designed expressly for oral health promotion and the first web-delivered intervention to address all aspects of oral health-related behavior. This approach would represent a dramatic shift away from current practice in dental care settings and has the potential to yield substantial reductions in oral health disparities. The proposed project has three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will entail developing an initial prototype of the program. For this purpose, stakeholder recommendations will be gathered in focus group interviews with 32 dental patients and 32 dental professionals, content from a previously developed manual for face-to-face MI-based oral health promotion will be translated into elements suitable for inclusion in the program, feedback on design concepts will be obtained from 8 patients, and a full-featured prototype program will be developed. Aim 2 will entail a minimum of two iterations of usability and acceptability testing and subsequent program refinement, with 8 patients participating in each iteration. Aim 3 will entail administering the program to 24 dental patients in a public health dental clinic context and evaluating the extent to which they perceive the program as engaging, relevant, and possessing MI-consistent features expected to motivate change in oral health-related behavior. Achieving these aims will yield a theory-based intervention with demonstrated usability and acceptability and will support a subsequent application for an NIDCR R34 Behavioral Clinical Trial Planning Grant (PAR-14-342) to document feasibility and proposed procedures of a clinical trial. These activities would, in turn, support an application under NIDCR’s U01 Clinical Trial Cooperative Agreement (PAR-15-059) mechanism to test the program’s ability to yield improvements in oral health behavior and reductions in oral disease. Subsequent adaptation also would permit intervention with individuals not currently receiving services (e.g., via a public website) and to specific populations at heightened risk (e.g., due to diabetes, substance use, or HIV infection). Project Narrative This project will improve public health by developing a theory-based, web-delivered intervention to promote healthy behavior in dental patients.

"Statewide implementation and evaluation of a rural, school-based, caries prevention program SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Our long term goal is to reduce oral health disparities in rural school children.  Our immediate goal is to test two new evidence-based, school-based, cavity prevention programs.  We will compare two preventions: (1) A newer, simpler, less expensive, efficient treatment using fluoride varnish + silver diamine fluoride; and (2) A more traditional, complex, expensive, time-intensive treatment that includes simple + sealants + interim therapeutic restorations. The simpler method takes 6 minutes to deliver, compared to the more complex method that takes 20 minutes. Therefore, if the simpler, less expensive is as effective as the more complex, more expensive method, the data could support clinical and policy change.  To compare the two methods we will use a cluster randomized control trial design. We will implement this program in rural New Hampshire schools. All children in a school with informed consent will receive the same treatment (either simple or complex). We will provide preventive care twice per year for the 5 year grant period.  We will follow all children longitudinally for five years to determine the effectiveness of each preventive method. The primary outcome to make this determination will be the percentage of children with untreated decay. This is one of the U.S. Healthy People oral health goals. We will also examine the cost and cost- effectiveness. This will allow us to determine the balance between effectiveness and cost.  Assessing effectiveness and costs is particularly important for reducing disparities. If an intervention is quick, inexpensive, and 100% effective, that is a relatively simple choice. Most interventions are not 100% effective. Therefore, information on time, expense, and effectiveness will allow us to make better informed clinical and policy decisions. Specifically, this will help us answer the question: How much of which preventive intervention will increase access, improve health, and reduce costs? Project Narrative  Dental cavities are world’s most prevalent disease. In the U.S., almost 4 in 10 rural schoolchildren have untreated cavities. To improve the health of children we will test two new school- based cavity prevention programs to see which works best.","Statewide implementation and evaluation of a rural, school-based, caries prevention program",9568409,R01MD011526,"['Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Sources ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Hygienists ', ' Dental Records ', ' Dentists ', ' Diamines ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' health-care expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Fluorides ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Planning ', ' plan health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Institutes ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' New Hampshire ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Schools ', ' Silver ', ' Ag element ', ' Dental Societies ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' restoration ', ' elementary school ', ' grade school ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Monitor ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' implementation research ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' prevention efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Caries prevention ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' health equity ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Prevention trial ', ' trial design ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative measure ', ' Preventive measure ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' rural counties ', ' Child Health ', ' ']",NIMHD,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,724499,0.1427255370948846
"Rural Urban Disparities and Determinants of Dental Services and Provider Mix Project summary Increasing access to preventive and therapeutic oral health services is among the objectives of Healthy People 2020. Disparities in access to these services exist for disadvantaged populations, particularly in rural communities. The proposed research frames oral health care disparities as a complex system with multiple interacting individual and contextual factors. This research is timely in providing important information for future dental workforce preparation to address needs in rural areas. This study will also inform states in designing dental benefits for adults in implementing health reform initiatives. The proposed study will use data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) (1999- 2015) and the Area Health Resource Files (AHRF). The three specific aims of the study are: Aim 1: Identify trends in urban-rural (/racial/ethnic) differences in dental services and provider types. Aim 2: Define the contributions and cross-level interactions of individual and contextual factors (e.g. per capita dentists) related to dental services and providers. Aim 3: Assess the effects of Medicaid expansion on oral health care disparities among adults. Our study will establish a trend of urban-rural disparities in the type of dental services individuals receive and differences in the types of dental providers, and provide baseline data on the effects of Medicaid expansion (Aims 1 & 3). This study will contribute to a better understanding of facilitators and barriers to oral health care (Aim 2). Collectively, the study will provide evidence on rural-urban/racial/ethnic disparities in dental services in the US, which can inform current and future initiatives to improve oral health in rural communities. The results are expected to have a positive impact by providing high-quality information on oral health care in the US for better planning of oral health care and dental workforce development and distribution. Project Narrative The proposed study will provide a comprehensive yet detailed examination of the delivery and quality of dental care in rural America during 1999-2015 by (1) systematically assessing the trend of dental services and dental professional mix, (2) assessing multilevel relationships between factors related to the types of dental services received and providers visited, and (3) assessing the effects of Medicaid expansion on rural and racial/ethnic oral health disparities among adults. Such evidence will be important for preparing the future dental workforce, formulating new interventions and programs that meet community needs to improve oral health, and designing Medicaid benefit packages in the future.",Rural Urban Disparities and Determinants of Dental Services and Provider Mix,9598919,R03DE027436,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Communities ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dentists ', ' Expenditure ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Future ', ' Dental General Practice ', ' dental practice ', ' Goals ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Dental Insurance ', ' dental health insurance ', ' Periodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontia insurance ', ' Oral Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Surgery Insurance ', ' Medicaid ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Patients ', ' Philosophy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rural Health ', ' Rural Population ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Tooth Extraction ', ' Urban Population ', ' Tooth Loss ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Rural Community ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Therapeutic ', ' permanent tooth ', ' Secondary Dentition ', ' Permanent Dentition ', ' Adult Dentition ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' health care service organization ', ' health care organization ', ' intervention program ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' trend ', ' Preparation ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' rural disparities ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' defined contribution ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Workforce Development ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' urban disparity ', ' rural America ', ' service providers ', ' ']",NIDCR,EAST CAROLINA UNIVERSITY,R03,2018,139760,0.26214974036334765
"Randomized Efficacy Trial of MySmileBuddy, a Family-centered Behavioral Intervention to Reduce Early Childhood Caries ABSTRACT/ PROJECT SUMMARY Longstanding practice has treated early childhood caries (ECC) primarily through surgical dental repair, reinforced by current payment systems, an approach that does not address the natural history of the disease or the oral hygiene and dietary behaviors that mediate its occurrence. Professional consensus on the value of ECC disease management is emerging but behavioral strategies remain largely unstudied among Hispanic children in the United States. The long-term goal of the proposed study is to reduce oral health disparities and inform a paradigm shift from a focus on treatment to one that also embraces prevention. It is known that using fluoridated toothpaste twice daily and consumption of a low cariogenic diet has both preventive and therapeutic value. What is not known is how to best translate the adoption and maintenance of salutary behaviors to populations at greatest risk. The proposed randomized controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy of a family focused behavioral intervention, MySmileBuddy, to reduce ECC progression in high-risk Hispanic preschoolers. We propose to recruit and enroll 858 two to five year-old children, all with ECC, along with their caregiver from pediatric medical clinics in northern Manhattan, New York City. Specific Aims are: (1) to assess MySmileBuddy's efficacy (versus control) to decrease ECC progression (defined as positive change in number of decayed, missing, or filled teeth (∆dmft>0) or surfaces (∆dfs>0)) measured 12-months post-randomization (and assessed again 24-months post-randomization); (2) to assess MySmileBuddy's efficacy (versus control) to enhance adoption of twice daily fluoridated toothpaste use and consumption of a low cariogenic diet; and (3) to assess causal pathways through which MySmileBuddy influences twice daily fluoridated toothpaste use and consumption of a low cariogenic diet. The proposed research is innovative and represents a departure from the status quo by shifting focus from treatment to prevention, shifting education from verbal instructions and written materials provided by dental professionals to using interactive Health Information Technology delivered by Community Health Workers, and capitalizing on general pediatrics practices as a conduit for promoting children's oral health. At the completion of this study, we will know the extent to which MySmileBuddy promotes parents' acquisition and maintenance of oral hygiene and dietary behaviors that reduce ECC progression in a high-risk population of Hispanic preschool children. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to reduce the number of children needlessly affected by this preventable disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Affecting more than one-in-four children under age six, tooth decay in young children is common and harmful, yet largely preventable. The proposed research is relevant to the public's health by testing a novel family- centered program's ability to help families learn and practice healthful behaviors, stop decay from progressing in children who already have cavities, and explain how and why the program works.","Randomized Efficacy Trial of MySmileBuddy, a Family-centered Behavioral Intervention to Reduce Early Childhood Caries",9522676,U01DE026739,"['Academy ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Preschool Child ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Counseling ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Cariogenic Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Water fluoridation ', ' fluoridation ', ' Goals ', ' Hygiene ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Motivation ', ' New York City ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Parents ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Pediatric Dentistry ', ' Pedodontics ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' Tooth structure ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth Diseases ', ' dental disorder ', ' dental disease ', ' Tooth Disorder ', ' Toothpaste ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Dental ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Nutritionist ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' American ', ' early childhood ', ' disease natural history ', ' novel ', ' payment ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Health Educators ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Instruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' efficacy trial ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' five years of age ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 years of age ', ' 5 year old ', ' high risk ', ' community setting ', ' health information technology ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' individualized care ', ' Precision care ', ' personalized care ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIDCR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2018,813333,0.1671116241477828
"Howard University Summer Research Experience Program in Oral Health Disparity for Underrepresented Racial and Ethnic Students ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How Racial disparity in oral health has been well documented for several decades. However, the disparity persists, particularly between African Americans and other ethnic groups, despite advances in diagnosis and treatment. Increasing diversity in oral health research and care workforce is an effective strategy to improve the Nation's capacity to address and eliminate oral health disparities. In this project, we propose a full-time eight-week summer research experience program (SREP) at Howard University, aiming at engaging, recruiting and training undergraduate students from underrepresented minority and other disparity populations into minority health care and oral health disparity research. This SREP is designed to be a specialized didactic and mentored academic program with a series of formal and informal research and education activities tailored for recruiting and training undergraduate students.  To provide effective mentoring for the students, we will: 1) develop a highly networked team of motivated and skilled mentors from various disciplines through the strong partnership between Howard and Johns Hopkins Universities; and 2) develop an effective and sustainable research training and education infrastructure by establishing a 3-tiered Mentoring System, Committees of Execution and Advising, and an Evaluation Core. The 3-tiered Mentoring System is specifically designed for mentoring each participating undergraduate by a primary mentor with basic, translational or public research focus at Howard, a secondary senior mentor at Johns Hopkins and other institutes, and a career development advisory mentor from oral health professionals.  The SREP is also designed to be an extension for two existing training programs at Howard University College of Dentistry: the NIH funded P20 program for training dental school students and faculty, and the HRSA funded Post-doctoral Training Program in Pediatric Dentistry (PTPD). Different from the two programs, the proposed SREP emphasizes on providing research experience for underrepresented undergraduates in oral health disparity. This program, combined with the P20 and PTPD programs, will bring together Howard students from diverse backgrounds and interests to create a rich mix of participants from across disciplinary backgrounds.  Through the SREP, we will be able to provide summer research training for five highly qualified students every year over the 5-year funding period (a total of 25 students). By participating in multi-disciplinary research projects and education events of senior investigators who will serve as mentors and role models, the students will gain valuable research experience and knowledge in oral health, and promote them into advanced education in oral health. Successful completion of this program will have significantly impacted the dental, oral and craniofacial research and training environment at Howard University College of Dentistry.

"Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia ABSTRACT  Oral disease, in particular childhood caries, remains a major health burden which affects some communities disproportionally, including regions of Appalachia. Both increased sugar intake and frequency of exposure alter the oral microbial community, triggering a disease process that leads to caries. Additional factors associated with caries in children include genetic risk, household SES, maternal caregiving behavior and stress, access to care. Progress has been made in understanding many of these factors. However, much remains to be done in order to further characterize individual risk factors, but just as importantly, to determine how interactions between them lead to oral health disparities.  The current proposal is a renewal of our ongoing project (R01-DE-014899) to identify factors contributing to the oral health disparity seen in northern Appalachia. The guiding philosophy of our project (the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia; COHRA) has been and continues to be that developing strategies to address this disparity requires simultaneous study of multiple risk components (ideally within families) to determine their roles, interactions among them, and their transmissibility patterns. COHRA's long- term goal remains to determine the sources of oral health disparity in a high risk, Northern Appalachian population so that effective preventive interventions can be designed and targeted.  During the previous project period that began Sept 1, 2009, we recruited a cohort of approximately 1000 northern Appalachian women during pregnancy (COHRA2), following them and their children through their children's second birthday. This prospective study of mother-child pairs complements the original cohort of approximately 840 northern Appalachian families (COHRA1) by gathering multifaceted, longitudinal data on the earliest antecedents of caries formation. As detailed in the progress report, the specific aims of the previous project period (using both COHRA1 and COHRA2 cohorts) were all accomplished (recruitment targets, genetic analyses of the COHRA1 cohort, psychosocial investigations, microbial assessments). We propose to follow the current COHRA2 cohort as it grows from ages 2 to 6, and to use the resulting longitudinal demographic, medical, diet, and psychosocial data to test hypotheses about the causal relationships between risk factors contributing to the unusually high rates of caries formation in this population. We will integrate the additional data to be collected with existing and new genetic and microbial data to identify “cariogenic profiles,” in which the interactions between mother and child genetics, oral ecology, diet, and other environmental/psychosocial behaviors in infancy and early childhood are combined to predict unusually high risks for onset of caries before age 6. NARRATIVE Oral disease, in particular childhood caries, remains a major health burden which affects some communities disproportionally, including regions of Appalachia. The goal of the requested competing continuation remains to determine the factors leading to oral health disparity in children followed up to age 6 from a high risk, Northern Appalachian population.",Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia,9524560,R01DE014899,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachian ', ' Appalachia ', ' Behavior ', ' Beverages ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Household ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mining ', ' Mothers ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Phenotype ', ' Philosophy ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tooth structure ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Woman ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Natural History ', ' Medical ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Oral ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Viral ', ' psychosocial ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' maternal stress ', ' stressed mothers ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' Modeling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' early onset ', ' anti-microbial peptide ', ' antimicrobial peptide ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' high risk ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' maternal care giving ', ' maternal caregiving ', ' recruit ', ' oral microflora ', ' oral microbiota ', ' oral microbial community ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,3625597,0.27427076199661
"Dental Health and Academic Achievement among Children in Medicaid Project Summary/Abstract Dental problems are the leading chronic conditions among children in the United States (US) and are more prevalent among children of low socioeconomic status. Dental health plays a key role in the overall health status and quality of life of children and may affect several domains of child development and growth including learning. However little is known about the broader impacts of dental health on children's academic achievement in the United States. A few studies have focused on the relationships between children's dental health and their educational performance. Most studies however have utilized self-reported data on dental health and schooling achievement and those that used objective measures included small samples with limited generalizability. This literature suggests that dental problems are related to worse schooling performance such as lower grades and school attendance. However, this evidence indicates association and not necessarily causal links as it is based on cross-sectional data and suffers from several limitations including the potential for unobservable confounders that can bias the estimates such as household dental care practices and parental style. Finally and perhaps most importantly, practically nothing is known about how seeking preventive dental care prior to school entry and during schooling years impacts educational achievement. We will identify the effects of dental health problems on trajectories of academic achievement of children in Medicaid in Iowa comparing children with dental problems to their unaffected siblings and classmates. Furthermore, we will examine the effects of preventive dental care on academic achievement using similar group comparisons as well as within-child changes over time. Those comparisons control for many potential confounders. Our study employs unique population-based and longitudinal data consisting of linkages between Medicaid enrollment and claims files, birth certificates, and high-quality objective measures of academic achievement based on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) and the Iowa Tests of Educational Development (ITED), which are administered regularly to virtually all students in Iowa. The sample includes around 40,000 children born between 2000 and 2007 and nearly 300,000 child- grade observations. Our work is highly impactful and innovative in being the first population-based study of the effects of dental health and service use on children's academic achievement in the US using objective measures and longitudinal data that allows tracking children over time to study their achievement trajectories. Identifying the interplays between dental health and academic achievement could ultimately inform the designing of pre-school and school-based interventions focused on dental health assessment and treatment to prevent and reduce learning problems. Furthermore, this knowledge will help to more accurately assess the societal value of policies and programs that improve access to dental care through childhood and adolescence. This study will identify the effects of dental problems as well as use of preventive dental care on the educational achievement of children enrolled in Medicaid in Iowa.

"Good Oral Health: a Bi-level Intervention to Improve Older Adult Oral Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application will extend a successful NIDCR-funded bi-level oral health self-management pilot conducted among older/disabled adults residing in one older adult residential building to six buildings and evaluate it using a modified fractional factorial design. The theoretical framework is based on Fishbein's modified theory of reasoned action called the Integrated Model (IM) of Behavioral Prediction. It is operationalized through Adapted Motivational Interviewing, an interactive tailored cognitive approach, and Practice-to-Mastery (AMI-PM). The intervention includes two components: 1) a face to face administration of the AMI-PM; and 2) a targeted building-level campaign that includes principles of practice to master (CA-PM). The specific aims are to: 1) Test the two main components of a bi-level intervention to improve clinical oral hygiene outcomes in relation to one another, and through differential sequencing. 2) Identify cognitive and behavioral mechanisms contributing to clinical oral hygiene outcomes. 3) Assess impact and sustainability of behavioral and clinical outcomes over time. The intervention will be carried out in three cycles of 150 participants each for a total of N=450. Each cycle will include two buildings matched by size and ethnic/linguistic composition housing older adults and those with disabilities. In one condition, the individual leve intervention will be introduced followed by the group level intervention. In the second condition, the group level intervention will precede the individual level. Survey and clinical measures taken at baseline, and following the administration of the first and second components. This design will enable comparison of the short term efficacy of the individual versus group level component (T1 - T2) and the shorter and longer term efficacy of the interventions (T3 - 3 months). Clinical measures at T4, 6 months later, will evaluate sustainability of effect. Primary outcome measures are gingival index and plaque score, both of which improved significantly in the pilot study. Significance lies in the potential of the intervention to address critical disparities in oral healh through oral health promotion initiatives in the locations where they reside as well as the ability to evaluate the intervention efficiently using a design alternative to the RCT. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study's primary significance lies in the potential of this bi-level intervention to address significant disparities in oral health and consequent morbidity or reduced quality of life among vulnerable, low-income and primarily minority older adults and those with disabilities through prevention in the locations where they reside. The intervention could provide a model for programs to reduce oral health disparities across Connecticut and nationally.",Good Oral Health: a Bi-level Intervention to Improve Older Adult Oral Health,9552140,U01DE024168,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Attitude ', ' Belief ', ' Communities ', ' Connecticut ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Gingival Indexes ', ' Grant ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Housing ', ' Hygiene ', ' indexing ', ' Institutes ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Medicine ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Motivation ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Dental Schools ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Self Management ', ' Advocacy ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Diagnostic ', ' programs ', ' Oral ', ' Location ', ' behavior prediction ', ' behavioral prediction ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Cognitive ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' health related quality of life ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' health practice ', ' comparative ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' health assessment ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,U01,2018,951305,0.19338890675542
"OHEAL: Oral Health Equity in Alaska ABSTRACT: This R21 applicant did formative work on barriers to dental care and achieving good oral health for Alaska Native children (Grant No. UH2DE025488, PI J. Cunha-Cruz) in which it identified the absence of critical dental office-systems that providers need to implement evidence-based practices (EBP) proven to control dental caries (tooth decay). American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) children suffer from the poorest oral health of all population groups in the United States with 3 times higher rates of untreated caries than non- Hispanic white children. Despite great resilience, tribal nations face geographical isolation, dentist shortages and distrust in health care systems exacerbating disparities. The Oral Health Equity for Alaska (OHEAL) program initiated by the applicant in collaboration with a tribal healthcare organization (SouthEast Alaska Regional Health Consortium - SEARHC) and local tribal communities offers a unique opportunity to implement an evidence-based, culturally-appropriate and theory-informed program to disseminate EBPs to Alaska Native settings. The purpose of this R21 is to adapt and test feasibility of an implementation strategy prior to larger-scale implementation and evaluation. The rationale is that tribal dental services want to increase dental caries control efforts for children in remote villages, but lack evidence-based tools adapted to the AIAN culture and environment that can be implemented and maintained effectively and efficiently. Our SPECIFIC AIMS are: 1) to collaboratively develop and culturally adapt the caries control tools and strategies; 2) to test the feasibility of the caries control tools and strategies; and 3) to investigate the acceptability and appropriateness of the caries control tools and strategies among provider, community and patient stakeholders. METHODS: Workshops with tribal organization, patient and community stakeholders will be used to culturally adapt EBP guidelines and office-systems tools and strategies. Data from interviews and surveys with community, patient and organizational stakeholders, dental claims and administrative records will be used to assess acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility. A feasibility test of the program will be conducted. Guided by organizational and behavioral theory, triangulation of qualitative and quantitative findings will identify office-systems strategies likely to be used by AIAN and non-AIAN dental providers. We will learn which implementation strategies, provider behaviors, and contextual factors are likely to impact implementation and identify mechanisms essential for program success as well as aspects difficult to implement. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed R21 will lead to a R01 proposal for a larger-scale study. This preliminary research is significant and innovative because of its focus on 1) improving public health by increasing caries control for AIAN children and for its implications for greater adoption and replication by others serving minority, low income, rural communities, and 2) advancing knowledge of how and why adaption of implementation strategies for dissemination of EBPs is necessary. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This R21 on dissemination and implementation research is relevant to public health because adaptation of implementation strategies for the dissemination of evidence-based practices for control of dental caries (tooth decay) will lead to population-level reductions in disease, particularly for low income Alaska Native children and adolescents. This research will provide an understanding of how office-system changes can be culturally adapted to an Alaska Native workforce and community to successfully disseminate proven, low-cost interventions to eliminate health disparities. Thus, the proposed research addresses the NIH/NIMHD strategic plan to support research on the factors underlying health disparities; to enhance research capacity to create a culturally sensitive and culturally competent workforce; and to engage in proactive community outreach and information dissemination.",OHEAL: Oral Health Equity in Alaska,9584861,R21MD012868,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alaska ', ' Algorithms ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communities ', ' Dental Care Delivery ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Offices ', ' Dentists ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Feedback ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Organizational Change ', ' Rural Community ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' Employee ', ' novel ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health organization ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Population Group ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' research data dissemination ', ' research dissemination ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' tribal health ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Collection ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' Minority ', ' tribal Nation ', ' tribal communities ', ' tribal community ', ' tribal board ', ' tribal organization ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' implementation science ', ' community setting ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' health equity ', ' tribal health care ', ' tribal healthcare ', ' intervention cost ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2018,242089,0.15037205152749122
"Interactive Parent-targeted Text Messaging in Pediatric Clinics to Reduce ECC ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to RFA-DE-15-006 ""Multidisciplinary and Collaborative Research Consortium to Reduce Oral Health Disparities in Children: A Multi-level Approach."" The prevalence of Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is increasing, disproportionately affecting racial and ethnic minorities (Dye, 2007). Prevention efforts for high risk groups require multi-level strategies. We will target parents/legal guardians of children (<6 years) during pediatric well-child visits at urban community health centers (CHCs), and provide a text-message based ECC prevention intervention. We will also target the pediatric providers in the CHCs to adopt oral health guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and also improve documentation within their Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Thus, our multi-level intervention includes children, parents, providers and the CHC system. 85% of adults use text messaging, with no disparities by race/ethnicity, education or income. The benefits of text message interventions include the use anywhere/anytime, low cost, scalability to large populations, ability to tailor message content and intensity, and provision of strategies in real time. CHCs are an ideal venue for oral health promotion both at an individual level (they provide care to the groups at highest risk for ECC) and at a population level (there are 90 CHCs electronically linked locally and >1,100 CHCs nationally). In Phase 1 (UH2), we will conduct focus groups and interviews with parents and CHC providers to inform the development of the oral health text message intervention, as well as assess CHC work flow to identify sustainable strategies for oral health integration and eventual dissemination. This formative work is vital to ensure cultural and environmental compatibility, as we have done previously. The text messages will be consistent with AAP guidelines, our theoretical model (Social Cognitive Theory), and our previous work. We will use the Fisher-Owens Model (2007) as an intervention planning framework. In Phase 2 (UH3), 850 parents/legal guardians of children <6 years attending our target CHCs will be randomized to receive one of two dose-equivalent text message interventions: Oral Health Texts (OHT) or Child Wellness Texts (CWT). The primary outcome variable will be ECC incidence at 24 months. We will assess mediators and moderators of the intervention effect, perform a budget impact analysis to determine the financial consequences of adoption, diffusion, and sustainability of the OHT intervention at CHCs, assess CHC changes in oral health promotion (provider practices and EHR documentation), and assess changes in both pediatric and parent oral health behaviors. This research has strong potential to be an evidence based program that could easily be adopted at low cost and low provider burden in the 1,128 CHCs in the U.S. that treat almost 4.5 million high risk children <6 years old. Our text message intervention is innovative because involves system-generated real time support, tailoring, feedback, and interactivity. Our study has theoretical significance because it integrates a testable theory with an intervention planning model to elucidate mechanisms of change at multiple levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Despite the fact that early childhood caries (ECC) is preventable, it is the most common chronic childhood disease in the US, affecting 28% of those aged 2-5, and disproportionately affecting poor and minority groups. We propose an interactive text messaging intervention delivered to parents of children younger than 6 years old, which aims to foster healthy parent behaviors and reduce ECC in their children. This novel, low cost approach has the potential to expand the ability of community health center (CHC) pediatric clinics to efficiently integrate oral health promotion into their practice and could easily be disseminated to the 1200 CHCs in the United States that treat 4.5 million children younger than 6, most of whom are at high risk for ECC.",Interactive Parent-targeted Text Messaging in Pediatric Clinics to Reduce ECC,9544164,UH3DE025492,"['Academy ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Budgets ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Educational Status ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Feedback ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Fluorides ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Legal Guardians ', ' Lip structure ', ' Lip ', ' literacy ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Parents ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Textiles ', ' fabric ', ' Time ', ' Toothbrushing ', ' tooth brushing ', ' Toothpaste ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Lifting ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Oral ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Caries prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' six years of age ', ' six year old ', ' age 6 years ', ' 6 years of age ', ' 6 year old ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Evidence based program ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tailored messaging ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' screening ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' Cultural Sensitivity ', ' racial minority ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' income disparities ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' intervention cost ', ' ']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,UH3,2018,1576287,0.24642982468932573
"Cross-sectional associations of oral microbiota with oral HPV infection among high-risk Hispanic adults PROJECT SUMMARY The rising rates of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancers in the U.S. is a significant public health issue, while Hispanics show increased burden of this malignancy. Recent research suggests differences in oral microbiota between oropharyngeal cancer cases and controls, and between HPV+ and HPV- individuals. Nonetheless, research evaluating the role of oral microbiota on oral HPV infection, a main risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer, is scarce, and essential to develop effective prevention strategies. The proposed cross-sectional study will recruit 300 participants from sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinics of Puerto Rico. The specific aims of this application are to (1) characterize the oral microbiota profiles of patients with and without oral HPV infection, and (2) assess the association between species-level oral microbiota and oral HPV infection. Participants will provide saliva samples for oral HPV detection, following the NHANES methodology, and for oral microbiota analysis. Socio-demographic, behavioral, dental, and medical characteristics will be collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Risk factors for oral HPV infection will be collected using the audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) methodology, a useful tool for collecting sensitive risk behavior data. HPV typing will be performed by dot-blot hybridization using 38 type-specific probes, including oncogenic and non-oncogenic types, while for microbiota, genomic DNA extractions and 16S rDNA V4 amplifications will be done. Samples will then be subjected to Illumina Miseq sequencing and data analyses. To our knowledge, this is the first study that will assess the association between the oral microbiota and oral HPV infection among a homogenous Hispanic population. Accumulating evidence supports a biological plausibility for the association between the microbiota and HPV infection in various anatomical sites and with oral cancer; however, data on its relationship with oral HPV infection is limited. The identification of the oral microbiota’s role on oral HPV infection may provide essential information for the development of preventive public health strategies, as if research shows that the oral microbiota modulates oral HPV infection and oral carcinogenesis, the implications for oral cancer prevention and control strategies might be important. PROJECT NARRATIVE Puerto Ricans are among the fastest growing segments of the U.S. Hispanic population, an ethnic group characterized by having high rates of HPV and oral cancer.

Project Narrative The goal of the American Association for Dental Research (AADR) Bloc Travel Grant program is to allow the most promising dental students and NIDCR-supported trainees to attend the International Association for Dental Research (IADR) General Session, to foster and encourage interest in dental research and to influence young scientists to consider and/or continue their education and subsequent career in the dental academic research. Oral diseases are among the most prevalent diseases affecting populations, exacting a high health and economic burden on the American population resulting in significant health disparities and inequalities. AADR continues to bring cutting edge research to bear on these challenges to continue to improve dental, oral and craniofacial research; and to do so requires a well-trained, diverse oral health research workforce.",Bloc Travel Grant for Dental Students and NIDCR-Supported Trainees to Fund Travel to the IADR General Session,9564874,R13DE027291,"['Affect ', ' American Dental Association ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Canada ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' England ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health ', ' Locales ', ' London ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Paper ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Students ', ' Dental Students ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Washington ', ' Woman ', ' Writing ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Dental Research ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' posters ', ' lectures ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Oral ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' craniofacial ', ' craniofacies ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' exhibitions ', ' skills ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' International ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' health economics ', ' Population ', ' health inequalities ', ' ']",NIDCR,"AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR DENTAL, ORAL, AND CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH",R13,2018,50000,0.17448956329408047
"Predicting Caries Risk in Underserved Children, from Toddlers to the School-Age Years, in Primary Healthcare Settings Project Summary/Abstract: Dental caries, one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood, is a largely preventable disease, yet approximately 23% of U.S. children 2-5 years-of-age experience dental caries, and this number more than doubles to 56% among those aged 6-8. In the current environment of escalating healthcare costs and resource constraints, the large disparities in caries experience and access to care that exist in the U.S., especially among low socioeconomic status (SES) and minority population groups, call for a greater focus on targeted (at the patient and tooth surface level), risk-based caries preventive and therapeutic strategies to be delivered through interprofessional partnerships, including primary healthcare settings. Our team has just finished following 1,326 children from age 1 to age 4, and we have started data analyses to validate a caries risk questionnaire for use by medical providers to accurately identify high caries risk toddlers. The problem is that, while caries experience more than doubles from ages 2-5 to 6-8, caries in primary teeth during mixed dentition is a largely neglected area of research and prevention, there is no validated caries risk tool for medical settings to easily help triage 5- 8 year old children, and there have been almost no studies following the life-course progression of caries in children 1-8. This information is critically important, as designing and targeting efficacious and cost-effective preventive therapies that can adapt to changes in the life-course from toddlers to school-age children is dependent on accurate risk factor and tooth surface assessment. Thus, the objectives of this innovative continuation renewal study are: 1) to develop a practical and easily-scored caries risk tool for use in primary medical healthcare settings to identify high caries risk children, expanding from the toddler (1-4) to the school-age years (5-8); and 2) to determine the relationships between caries risk profiles and caries disease patterns (e.g., occlusal vs. proximal) in the mixed dentition. This will be accomplished by following a cohort of 876 primary caregiver (PCG)-child pairs from our ongoing U01's enrolled pairs. This cohort represents a diverse population, including ethnic/racial minorities and low SES groups. The PCG will complete a caries risk questionnaire and the child will have caries examinations at baseline (child's age 5.5 years old + 3 months), and again at 18 months (child's age 7 years + 3 months) and 36 months after baseline (child's age 8.5 years + 3 months) to monitor the caries disease process. Longitudinal caries risk data and caries disease prevalence/incidence and tooth surface pattern information collected from age 1-4 (ongoing U01) and 5-8 (proposed continuing renewal) will be used to assess risk of caries in children ages 5-8. A great strength of this proposal is that it involves four experienced medical and dental investigator groups, who have successfully worked together for the past 5.5 years and can facilitate follow-up of the study cohort. The significance is that identification of high caries risk children in primary healthcare settings will allow cost- effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed, targeted and used in interprofessional settings to prevent caries development from the toddler to the school-age years. This will have immediate broad impact and influence on existing and/or new policies and programs to be delivered by non-dental professionals in medical settings and other non- healthcare settings (e.g., school-based), as well as by dental professionals in dental healthcare settings. Relevance:  The relevance of this collaborative, innovative and high impact project (continuing renewal of our ongoing caries risk study U01-DE021412-06) is that it will result in a valid, reliable, and practical (easy to score) caries risk assessment tool for the identification of high caries risk children, expanding from the toddler to the school-age years, in primary medical healthcare and other non-dental settings (e.g., could be used at the required physical before entering public schools, etc.). When information collected from age 5-8 is combined with data from our ongoing U01 grant (ages 1-4), it will enhance understanding of life-course caries risk changes and changing patterns of carious tooth surfaces (e.g., occlusal vs. proximal) in children from age 1-8, allowing for cost-effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed and targeted to prevent caries. This proposal is responsive to NIDCR's Strategic Plan Goal 2.2 [Engage primary care providers and health specialists toward individualized, evidence-based health assessment, disease prevention, and treatments] and Goal 3 [Apply rigorous, multidisciplinary research approaches to overcome disparities in dental, oral, and craniofacial health].","Predicting Caries Risk in Underserved Children, from

"Developing an Oral Health Behavior Social Support Scale for Mexican-origin Adults Project Summary Nationwide, Mexican-American adults over age 30 have the highest prevalence of periodontal disease of all racial/ethnic groups (67% vs. 43% fornon-Hispanic Whites)(Eke, Dye et al. 2015). Poor oral hygiene is one risk factor for this common, preventable disease. However, few interventions focus on improving oral hygiene in this high-risk group, many of whom are also low-income and lack access to dental care. Social support has been targeted successfully in social and behavioral interventions to improve dietary behaviors, physical activity, and chronic disease management among Mexican-origin adults, but it has not been studied extensively in an oral health context. In addition, the role of social support differs for men and women with other health behaviors, supporting the need to study differences between men and women. This study addresses these gaps by developing a bilingual (English/Spanish) oral health behavior-specific social support scale for use in future intervention research. Developing such a measure will enable more precise assessment of the role and perceived impact of different sources and types of social support on daily hygiene behavior, dental care utilization, and oral health outcomes. Our experienced, multi-disciplinary team proposes a two-phase mixed methods study that will: 1) qualitatively explore the relevant social influences on oral health behavior for lower income Mexican-origin young adult men and women to understand structural and functional aspects of social support; 2) develop and pilot test an oral health behavior-specific social support scale, and 3) quantitatively assess the scale’s psychometric properties and association with oral health status and behavior. Phase I proposes semi-structured interviews with 25-40 men and 25-40 women from the target population of Mexican- origin young adults, to explore dimensions of social support in an oral health context as part of scale item generation and refinement. Cognitive interviews will be conducted to assess scale content and understanding of item and response option wording and order of the draft scale with 40 different adults from the target population, before it is piloted with 200 adults. Phase II will quantitatively validate the scale. Surveys will be conducted with 500 men and women, and a subset of >250 will also receive a dental exam. Phase II analysis will include cluster and factor analysis of the new social support scale, calculate the Cronbach’s alpha to assess internal consistency, and assess scale and subscale validity (content, face, construct, concurrent, divergent, and discriminant validity) and reliability. Sex-stratified analyses will examine associations with self-reported oral hygiene behavior (brushing, flossing, rinsing), dental care utilization, multiple self-rated oral health status indices, and clinically-assessed oral health status (tooth loss; caries; periodontal disease). This study will yield a culturally-sensitive social support scale that will advance understanding of potential pathways through which social relationships affect oral health behavior and outcomes for young adults of Mexican-origin, at high risk for oral disease, findings important for future theory-informed, evidence-based randomized controlled trials. Public Health Relevance This study will develop and validate a culturally-relevant, behavior-specific social support scale that will advance understanding of pathways among oral hygiene behaviors (brushing, flossing, rinsing), dental care utilization, and oral health status among young Mexican-origin adults at high risk for oral disease.

"Role of Non-Dental Providers in Reducing Disparities in Early Childhood Oral Health: Impact of State Medicaid Policies Project Summary Early childhood caries (ECC), commonly referred to as tooth decay, is a preventable disease that disproportionally affects children enrolled in Medicaid and other historically disadvantaged groups. Receiving preventive oral health services (POHS) at an early age helps to prevent ECC, yet populations experiencing the most ECC have the lowest use of POHS. To improve access to POHS for these vulnerable populations, nearly all state Medicaid programs have adopted policies covering physician-based POHS. Despite widespread adoption of policies and evidence of policy effectiveness, states exhibit variation in rates of physician-based POHS use. This project will explore how physician-based POHS coverage policies have affected POHS use and oral health outcomes of Medicaid-enrolled infants and toddlers over time, overall, and among historically underserved and high-risk populations. Using a national sample, we will consider the reimbursement rate, training requirement, and comprehensiveness of services provided for physician-based POHS in order to identify the types of policies that best promote use of POHS and oral health outcomes. Project Narrative This project will explore how state Medicaid policies covering physician-based preventive oral health services (POHS) have affected POHS use and oral health outcomes of Medicaid-enrolled infants and toddlers over time, overall, and among historically underserved and high-risk populations.

"CenteringPregnancy Oral Health Promotion (CPOP) Clinical Trial Abstract Federal agencies and professional organizations have mounted a large effort to address an increasingly recognized public health problem – poor perinatal oral health – which has serious implications for maternal and child health and is largely preventable. Several national organizations have issued statements prioritizing the need to improve oral health and access to oral health care during pregnancy and the National Maternal and Child Health Bureau has released consensus statements and clinical guidelines on perinatal oral health care during pregnancy. The provision of the recommended oral health care during pregnancy has the potential to improve women's oral health through improved prevention and restorative care and to promote children's oral health through caregiver education and timely anticipatory guidance. Through funding from the NIDCR (R21DE019211 Adams, PI; U54 DE019285 Chung, PI), we developed and pilot tested the CenteringPregnancy Oral Health Promotion (“CPOP”) Intervention, an oral health intervention for pregnant women attending CenteringPregnancy® (CP), a group prenatal care program. The CPOP intervention consists of 2 educational and skills building modules (maternal and infant) that are integrated into the CP curriculum, and delivered by trained CP facilitators. To evaluate the modules, the women completed dental examinations and questionnaires assessments of OH knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors at pre- and post- intervention periods. Infant and maternal salivary bacterial levels were assessed when the infants were 6 and 12 months of age. Findings from the CPOP pilot studies show significant improvements in maternal and infant clinically-assessed oral health. NIDCR funding (R34DE024574) has supported the development of the final planning and preparation for the U01 CPOP RCT. The purpose of this U01 proposal is to test the efficacy of the CPOP intervention as a full scale Phase III randomized controlled trial among a group of women receiving CP prenatal care at sites across Northern California. If shown to be efficacious, CPOP could be implemented rapidly and broadly nationwide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although dental care during pregnancy including preventive and restorative care and anticipatory guidance regarding optimal infant oral health is important, most women do not receive dental care during pregnancy. However, most women do access prenatal care, and there are many aspects of dental care that can be delivered in non-dental settings such as prenatal care including oral health education, hygiene instruction and anticipatory guidance for infant oral health. If the CenteringPregnancy® Oral Health Promotion (CPOP) intervention was determined to be efficacious within a U01 clinical trial, it could be disseminated widely into CenteringPregnancy® (CP) group prenatal care programs nationwide, and potentially in other group care models, having a significant positive influence on oral health of women and children broadly.",CenteringPregnancy Oral Health Promotion (CPOP) Clinical Trial,9422373,U01DE027340,"['clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' evidence base ', ' standard of care ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' efficacy testing ', ' interactive learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' applied learning ', ' hands-on learning ', ' community building ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' Child Health ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' Attitude ', ' Attitude to Health ', ' health attitude ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Bacteria ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hygiene ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Lactobacillus ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mothers ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Prenatal care ', ' prenatal visit ', ' prenatal checkup ', ' prenatal appointment ', ' pregnancy care ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' professional society ', ' professional membership ', ' professional association ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Streptococcus mutans ', ' S.mutans ', ' S. mutans ', ' S mutans ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' post-partum ', ' Postpartum ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Peripartum ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Fostering ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Letters ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Salivary ', ' health knowledge ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' skills ', ' empowerment ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Age-Months ', ' caregiver education ', ' caregiver training ', ' care giver training ', ' care giver instruction ', ' care giver education ', ' Caregiver instruction ', ' Maternal and Child Health ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' ACOG ', ' American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ', ' Preparation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' post intervention ', ' Instruction ', ' oral streptococci ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' prenatal health ', ' ']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U01,2018,1106613,0.2803680329082957
"Obesity and Caries in Young South Asian Children: A Common Risk Factor Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Asians are the fastest growing immigrant community in the United States and experience high rates of health disparities. South Asian children are at high risk for the two most common diseases of early childhood: caries and obesity. This application uses the Common Risk/Health Factor Approach (CR/HFA) to target risk factors for childhood caries and obesity. Our study, CHALO! (""Child Health Action to Lower Oral Health and Obesity Risk"") comes from the Hindi word that means ""Let's go!"". CHALO is a multi-level intervention (see figure) that includes a randomized controlled trial of a home visit intervention, and a Knowledge Translation campaign. The primary focus is behavioral change in bottle/'sippy' cup use and dietary intake-- factors that are common to both caries and obesity. Unique cariogenic and obesogenic behaviors are also targeted. Secondary outcomes include caries incidence and growth. Research assessments when children are 6 (baseline), 12, and 18 months of age will include novel techniques for assessing feeding practices (i.e., iPad assisted 24 hour dietary recall) and caries presence and severity (i.e., intra-oral cameras) that were developed by our team. CHALO will be conducted in the metro NY/NJ area, home to a large low-income high risk South Asian community. An RCT (Aim 1) will enroll 377 mothers of children 4-6 months old from New York City (n=3) and New Jersey (n=2) pediatric practices in our primary care research network SAPPHIRE (""SA Practice Partnership for Health Improvement and Research""). The intervention includes: a) home visits with mothers/families (n=6 visits over one year) and follow up phone support; b) patient navigation to make/keep timely dental visits (2x by 18 months). The Knowledge Translation component (Aim 2) will raise awareness of child health risks in South Asian communities and among professionals who provide their care. The campaign will include both traditional and social media components and will be evaluated using multiple metrics. Our multi-disciplinary team has expertise in cross-cultural psychology, clinical trials, child nutrition, health education and caries. CHALO builds upon the team's prior and on-going funded trials of caries and obesity interventions in young children. Innovations include: use of CR/HFA to target twin child health disparities; under-studied South Asian immigrant sample; intervention at multiple levels of the Social-Ecological model; cutting edge measurement technologies; and social marketing and evaluation. If successful, the CR/HFA offers an efficient and potentially cost-effective means of improving child health in at-risk populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study employs a Common Risk/Health Factors Approach (CR/HFA) to the 2 most common health disparities of early childhood -dental caries and obesity-- in the nation's fast growing low-income South Asian immigrant community. It includes: a) an RCT- aimed at reducing feeding practices that increase caries and obesity risks (e.g., use of bottle/'sippy' cups) and increasing health-promoting behaviors (activity, dental visit) in young children, and b) a Knowledge Translation campaign to raise awareness among families, communities, and dental and pediatric providers. This study represents the first application of the CR/HFA in the nation, and only the second RCT of this efficient and potentially cost-effective approach worldwide.",Obesity and Caries in Young South Asian Children: A Common Risk Factor Approach,9413926,R01MD010460,"['Anxiety ', ' Awareness ', ' Bangladesh ', ' Behavior ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child ', ' pediatric nutrition ', ' Child Nutrition ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' Control Groups ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Care ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Decay ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental caries ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Family ', ' Feeding Patterns ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health education ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Incidence ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Methods ', ' Milk ', ' Modernization ', ' Mothers ', ' New Jersey ', ' New York City ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Obesity ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Pakistan ', ' Partnership Practice ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Marketing ', ' Sweeteners ', ' Sweetening Agents ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Time ', ' tooth brushing ', ' Toothbrushing ', ' Twins ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Dental ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Napping ', ' Intervention ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Juice ', ' Dietary intake ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Length ', ' Age-Months ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' South Asian ', ' follow-up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' Behavioral ', ' obesity in children ', ' child adiposity ', ' child obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obese children ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' Home visitation ', ' House Call ', ' home visit ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' tv watching ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' feeding ', ' cost effective ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' knowledge translation ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' secondary outcome ', ' obesogenic ', ' obesigenic ', ' social media ', ' Child Health ', ' ']",NIMHD,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2018,770132,0.11087885270837702
"Phase III RCT of the Effectiveness of Silver Diamine Fluoride in Arresting Cavitated Caries Lesions Summary The proposed Cooperative Agreement is for support for a Phase III randomized clinical trial (RCT) to assess the effectiveness of 38% silver diamine fluoride (SDF). SDF recently became available in the U.S., and is non-invasive, inexpensive and simple to use for management of cavitated lesions exposing dentin clinically (i.e., holes) in primary teeth. Early childhood caries (ECC) continues to be one of the most prevalent chronic conditions among U.S. children. It also is one of the most common unmet healthcare needs of poor children (e.g., Head Start children). If allowed to progress untreated for long periods of time, the disease can have broad dental, medical, social, and quality of life consequences. ECC and severe-ECC (e.g., multiple cavitated lesions or at least one caries lesion in the anterior teeth, with onset at an early age) is relatively inexpensive to prevent, yet becomes extremely burdensome on the children and families, and expensive to treat once lesions cavitate (e.g., with stainless steel crowns, extractions, etc.). This is especially true in young children who need extensive treatment, or are uncooperative and/or have immature cognitive functioning, disabilities, or medical conditions, where treatment under general anesthesia, in most cases in hospital operating rooms, is the standard of care. In 2016, the FDA issued a notice to health care providers that general anesthesia in young children can result in permanent neurological damage and should be avoided. Thus, better strategies are needed to successfully manage cavitated caries lesions in young children. The proposed RCT will be accomplished by targeting young children enrolled in Head Start programs who have cavitated caries lesions that have exposed dentin clinically. Because of the Breakthrough Therapy Status for SDF, FDA has been heavily involved in the design of this trial to ensure it will meet the requirements for a cavitated caries lesion “arrest” drug claim, which is innovative in the U.S. The proposed protocol in this application has been submitted by Advantage Silver Dental Arrest, LLC, holder of IND 124808, to the FDA as part of our collaboration. In the first months of funding, we will work with NIDCR to review all relevant study documents and manuals for the RCT, submit to IRBs, and calibrate all study examiners. Following this study preparation period, an experienced research team will conduct a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled superiority trial, with two parallel groups involving a total of 1,040 children, 2-5 years old, who will be followed over a period of 8 months, to assess: The tooth-Aim 1 (Primary study aim)- the impact of 38% SDF applied twice, 6 months apart, on arrest of cavitated lesions in the primary dentition (assessed using the ICDAS II severity and activity criteria). Secondary aims will further assess whether the provision of SDF impacts: the child-Aim 2 [effects of SDF on children's pain and pulpal infection], and the family-Aim 3 [effects of SDF on oral health-related quality of life (Sub-Aim 3a), and treatment satisfaction and acceptability (Sub-Aim 3b)]. The immediate impact and significance of this innovative project is that provision of and access to a non-invasive, inexpensive, and simple to use alternative strategy to manage cavitated caries lesions for children with limited access to care could profoundly improve oral health by arresting lesions, reducing pain, improving quality of life, and significantly reducing costs, all contributing to substantial reductions in disparities in caries. Project Narrative: The University of Michigan, in collaboration with researchers at New York University, the University of Iowa, Indiana University, the University of Otago, and consultants from the University of Hong Kong and University of Maryland propose to implement a Phase III multicenter, randomized clinical trial (RCT), to test the effectiveness of 38% Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF) in stopping the progression of cavities (i.e., large holes which result from dental caries, a common and debilitating disease) in the teeth of young children. Should the trial be successful, the impact would be a change in the standard of care and expanded access to a simple, non-invasive, inexpensive strategy to manage cavitated caries lesions in young children in the U.S., which otherwise are usually treated with potentially damaging general anesthesia and fillings or extractions.

"Longitudinal Analysis of Low pH Streptococci and Plaque Microbiome in Early Childhood Caries ABSTRACT  The microbial etiology of dental caries remains a subject of debate with considerable differences of opinion regarding the relative contributions of specific species or classes of bacteria. The `low pH streptococci' is a designation given to atypical, highly acidogenic strains of oral streptococci originally thought to belong to the primary plaque colonizing species S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii, and S. anginosus. This sub-group of streptococci is proposed to have considerable cariogenic potential, perhaps preceding, augmenting or even overshadowing the contribution of the mutans streptococci (MS). However, assessing the role of the low pH strep is not straightforward. Accurate assignment of species among the viridans streptococci is a challenge, and the low pH phenotype cannot be ascertained by the gene-based strategies routinely employed in non-culture based studies of the oral microbiome. In this application we propose a unique prospective study that combines state-of-the-art bioinformatics with phenotypic analyses of low pH phenotypes to track changes in the plaque microbiome, with a specific focus on the MS and non-MS low pH streptococci, as caries develop in children at high risk for early childhood caries. Specifically, our objectives are to determine if there is ascendancy of non- MS low pH streptococci within the plaque oral microbiome with potential shifts in composition of other organisms during the transition from a sound enamel site to a carious enamel site. In addition, we propose a novel and exciting approach of categorizing low pH streptococci based on their potential to produce alkaline products. We believe that gaining a more comprehensive assessment of the low pH streptococcal species or taxa, and our novel grouping of these organisms based on alkaline-producing phenotypes, as part of our determination of the plaque microbiome composition has the potential to make significant contributions to implementation science. To meet our objectives we propose the following aims: 1) Conduct an 18-month longitudinal study on high-caries risk children aged 1-3 to determine changes in the overall plaque microbiome preceding caries development, with a focus on the non-MS low pH streptococci; and 2) Use genomic sequencing to assign species identity or taxonomical relatedness to the non-MS low pH streptococci recovered in Aim 1. By coalescing and analyzing the data from the microbiome and low pH streptococci as caries develop we will define patterns or drivers of caries or health that may provide a basis for advances in implementation science. NARRATIVE  A major influence on the development of dental decay is the composition of bacteria that comprise dental plaque. In the proposed study, we will examine the recoveries and proportions of a prominent group of plaque bacteria, the streptococci, from dental plaque samples collected from ages one to three in a population of children at a high risk for early childhood dental decay. We will compare the changes in streptococcal populations with the overall plaque microbiome composition to gain a better appreciation for the microbial contribution to dental decay so that more efficient means of risk assessment, treatment and prevention can be formulated.",Longitudinal Analysis of Low pH Streptococci and Plaque Microbiome in Early Childhood Caries,9442542,R01DE026716,"['Acid-Base Equilibrium ', ' Acid-Base Balance ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Bacteria ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Enamel ', ' tooth enamel ', ' Enamel ', ' Dental Plaque ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Iowa ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Odontogenesis ', ' dental development ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Pathology ', ' Pediatric Dentistry ', ' Pedodontics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Scoring Method ', ' sound ', ' Streptococcus ', ' Streptococcus mutans ', ' S.mutans ', ' S. mutans ', ' S mutans ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' exhaust ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Lesion ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Recovery ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Host Factor ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' Streptococcus mitis ', ' Streptococcus mitior ', ' S.mitis ', ' S.mitior ', ' S. mitis ', ' S. mitior ', ' S mitis ', ' S mitior ', ' Streptococcus anginosus ', ' S.anginosus ', ' S. anginosus ', ' S anginosus ', ' Streptococcus Viridans Group ', ' viridans group streptococci ', ' Viridans Streptococci ', ' Streptococcus oralis ', ' S.oralis ', ' S. oralis ', ' S oralis ', ' Streptococcus gordonii ', ' S.gordonii ', ' S. gordonii ', ' S gordonii ', ' Research Priority ', ' Pattern ', ' pediatric department ', ' alkalinity ', ' basicity ', ' early childhood ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Genomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Streptococcus viridans ', ' S.viridans ', ' S. viridans ', ' S viridans ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' microbiome ', ' oral microbiome ', ' oral streptococci ', ' oral plaque ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' microbiome species composition ', ' microbiome community composition ', ' microbiome composition ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2018,495389,0.19728688772915784
"Dental Service Utilization for Foreign and Native-born Children in America Project Summary Children from immigrant families constitute one of the largest and fastest growing racial and ethnic minority population groups in the United States. Yet, immigrant children's oral health status, dental needs and dental service utilization are understudied and poorly understood. Few published studies on oral health of immigrant adults and children are based on convenience and small sample sizes or Medicaid data from a single state and all have provided mixed results. The specific characteristics within the foreign-born population that could explain any differential uptake in dental service utilization to address disparity is limited. In addition, existing literature on oral health disparities have focused on socioeconomic factors and do not include social and cultural determinants of oral health such as immigration status. This gap in knowledge specifically hampers the development and implementation of appropriate policies and programs that could achieve positive oral health outcomes for immigrant children. Immigrant oral health is influenced by individual, community and healthcare system factors both before and after immigration, yet it is unclear how these factors contribute to overall oral health disparities. Immigrant children's oral health is a growing dental public health concern due to the significant consequences of common oral diseases if left untreated. The overall goal of this project is to address the gap in knowledge related to immigrant children's oral health and to explore how immigrant children's oral health characteristics contribute to oral health disparities. In addition, this study will identify specific characteristics and health care level factors required for appropriate intervention to reduce these disparities. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to determine the patterns and time trend of dental services utilization and unmet dental needs of foreign-born children from 2002 to 2014; and (2) to examine the extent to which immigrant status factors such as length of stay, language spoken at home and other person-level demographic factors explain variations in dental access, utilization and unmet dental needs of foreign-born children compared to native-born children from 2002 to 2014. This project will be conducted by a team of multidisciplinary researchers using two nationally representative databases: the 2001-2013 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the 2002-2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Descriptive statistics will be conducted to provide estimates of counts and rates of dental services utilization and unmet dental needs. Logistic regression models will then be fit to determine outcome variables associated with other covariates. Structural equation modeling (SEM) will be used to describe the relationship between latent phenomena captured by multiple related variables, such as acculturation. Findings from this project will be used to inform the development of priorities and policies directed at immigrant children's oral health and oral health disparities.   Project Narrative Children from immigrant families are one of the fastest growing groups in the nation and their oral health contributes to overall health and health disparities. The individual and societal consequences of oral health disparities including inadequate access to dental care, are of immense concern to dental public health professionals. Dental public health professionals and stakeholders will use the findings from this project to develop appropriate intervention strategies including the formulation of appropriate local, state, and national priority and policy guidelines for immigrant children's oral health.  ",Dental Service Utilization for Foreign and Native-born Children in America,9539990,R03DE027159,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Americas ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communities ', ' Dental Care Delivery ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Exhibits ', ' Expenditure ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Immigration ', ' Dental Insurance ', ' dental health insurance ', ' Periodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontia insurance ', ' Oral Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Surgery Insurance ', ' Language ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Literature ', ' Medicaid ', ' Medicine ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Persons ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Parents ', ' Population Surveillance ', ' Public Health Surveillance ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Societies ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Tooth Diseases ', ' dental disorder ', ' dental disease ', ' Tooth Disorder ', ' United States ', ' Native-Born ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' uptake ', ' Immigrant ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Equation ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Population Group ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' 18 years of age ', ' 18 year old ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' service utilization ', ' Formulation ', ' Preventive dental service ', ' Preventative dental service ', ' Preventative dental care ', ' Preventive dental care ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' health seeking behavior ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Time trend ', ' Child Health ', ' ']",NIDCR,MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY,R03,2018,157449,0.3145962834343139
"Relationship of Parental Health Literacy with Change Over Time in Oral Health Outcomes Among American Indian Children Project Summary  “Health literacy” (HL) refers to “the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.” Among American Indians and Alaska Natives, 48% of adults have limited HL. This high rate of limitations is concerning given that restricted HL is related to poor health-related knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and outcomes. Although it is clear that HL limitations among parents are related to suboptimal outcomes in children, few studies have examined the link between parental HL (PHL) and children's oral health. Further, because prior studies have used cross-sectional data, it is unclear whether PHL is related to change over time in children's oral health. The objective of the project is to investigate the association of PHL with change over time in pediatric oral health outcomes and to clarify the mechanisms that explain the PHL-outcomes relationship. The role of PHL will be explored in a sample of American Indians, a population at risk for poor oral health. Indeed, by age 5, 75% of Native children have dental decay. Using secondary data from the NIDCR-funded project “Promoting Behavioral Change for Oral Health in American Indian Mothers and Children” (PBC; U54DE019259), the research team will use advanced analytic techniques to test a theoretical framework designed to clarify the mechanisms through which PHL is linked to pediatric oral health outcomes. The mediating roles of parental oral health knowledge, attitudes, and behavior will be examined. The PBC project is a randomized controlled trial designed to test the impact of a motivational interviewing intervention on parental oral health knowledge, attitudes, behavior, and pediatric oral health outcomes. The analysis sample will include 575 parent-child dyads recruited when the child was a newborn and followed for 3 years. The specific aims of the study are the following: (1) Using baseline data, assess the relationship of PHL with parental oral health knowledge, attitudes, and behavior; (2) Using longitudinal data, determine the relationship of baseline PHL with change over time in parental oral health knowledge, attitudes, and behavior, and with pediatric oral health outcomes; and (3) Determine whether the proposed theoretical framework accurately explains the relationships among baseline PHL; parental oral health knowledge, attitudes, and behavior; and pediatric oral health outcomes. The proposed project will be the first to examine the association of PHL with change over time in children's oral health outcomes and to clarify the mechanisms that explain that relationship. As testing of a comprehensive conceptual model of PHL has not been conducted, the study's results will advance science related to PHL and inform development of effective oral health interventions for American Indians and other high-risk populations. In addition, this work will provide a critical evaluation of the role PHL plays in the oral health of Native communities, a population at risk for limited PHL and poor pediatric oral health outcomes. The project addresses NIDCR's aims to overcome disparities in oral health and to examine risk factors and mechanisms of behavior change in oral health. Project Narrative  The term “health literacy” refers to the ability to understand and use health-related information. This project will clarify how parental health literacy is associated with change over time in oral health outcomes among American Indian children. Findings from this work will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms through which parental health literacy is linked to outcomes and will inform the development of interventions that will be effective for parents with limited health literacy skills.",Relationship of Parental Health Literacy with Change Over Time in Oral Health Outcomes Among American Indian Children,9519527,R01DE027077,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Attitude ', ' Attitude to Health ', ' health attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Fluorides ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' newborn children ', ' newborn child ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Information Services ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' Mothers ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' South Dakota ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tooth structure ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' sugar ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' health knowledge ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' skills ', ' parental role ', ' parent role ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' literate ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Age-Months ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Pine Ridge Indian Reservation ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' group intervention ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' trial design ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2018,308279,0.2642671032840372
"Learning about Early Childhood Caries Prevention in a Latino Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed K99/R00 career development award application will support academic preparation and the initiation of an independent research career focused on multilevel factors associated with oral health using a strengths-based approach to reduce pediatric oral health disparities. The oral health of a child cannot be separated from family, community and the environment; thus it is vital to include a multilevel perspective in any comprehensive model of children's oral health. My research in the K99 phase will describe the maternal psychosocial and behavioral factors associated with ECC and also will describe the prevalence of dental caries in a sample of Latino children. Measures taken from the Basic Research Factors Questionnaire (BRFQ) will be used to describe psychosocial and behavioral factors (e.g., oral health locus of control, health beliefs, self- efficacy, Sense o Coherence, stress, importance of oral health, oral health knowledge and behaviors) in Latina mothers of preschool children in Denver, Colorado. The results of this study will be compared to that of a high-risk American Indian population in which similar measures from the BRFQ were used. During the R00 phase, a mixed methods approach will be used to describe the differences at child, family and community levels for caries-free and caries-active urban dwelling Latino children. This methodology will capture the factors measured by the BRFQ survey and then will use qualitative methods to further probe characteristics at each level. I will use asset mapping, which is one on the strengths-based approaches, to describe the protective health assets that enhance the ability of individuals, families, communities and social systems to maintain and sustain oral health and to help reduce oral health inequities in high risk and vulnerable groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research and training has three-fold relevance for public health. First, the award will promote to mentor and nurture a new investigator, who has a background in dentistry and public health and is committed to reducing oral health disparities in the United States. Second, this project will use a multidisciplinary and multi-method approach to describe the protective factors against early childhood caries in Latino children at individual, family and community level. Through this research we will be able to understand why some children, despite being at high risk for developing dental caries, remain caries-free. This will not only add essential and indispensable information to the literature but will guide other investigators in their research. Finally, this research will develop a conceptual outline for behavioral interventions based on the principles of strength based approaches in a community rather than based on pathological model.",Learning about Early Childhood Caries Prevention in a Latino Population,9459359,R00DE024758,"['American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Preschool Child ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dentistry ', ' Dentists ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environment and Public Health ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Control Locus ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mothers ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Parents ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Distal ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' health knowledge ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Head Start ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' FIRST Award ', ' First Independent Research Support and Transition Awards ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' reservation-based ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Caries prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Academic support ', ' academic readiness ', ' academic preparation ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' urban dwelling ', ' service delivery ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R00,2018,246654,0.31909119035797195
"Health Reform and Oral Health Disparities: a Mixed Methods Evaluation Project Summary/Abstract Despite numerous efforts to increase access to dental care for vulnerable groups, disparities in oral health and healthcare continue to exist. Medicaid is now the nation's largest source of health insurance coverage, and since it primarily offers insurance to low-income and disabled individuals, Medicaid is a key policy lever for addressing socioeconomic disparities in health care. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded Medicaid to millions of previously ineligible adults, but only 31 states and Washington DC, have chosen to participate thus far. The goal of this proposal is to leverage the natural experiment created by ACA implementation and take advantage of state-level variation in the extent of dental care covered by Medicaid in order to assess the impact of these policies to date on oral health inequalities. As Congress continues to consider major changes to Medicaid and the ACA, the results of our analysis can offer important insights for the future of oral health inequalities. We propose a mixed-methods study, combining a quantitative component using a quasi-experimental study design and national public datasets, and a qualitative element using primary data collection to assess the impact of the ACA Medicaid expansion on oral health. This project includes four studies; during the K99 phase we propose to address the following aims: 1) To estimate the effect of Medicaid expansion under the ACA on access to and utilization of oral health services; and 2) To measure the impact of Medicaid expansion on individuals' oral health- related behaviors and race/ethnic and socioeconomic inequalities in untreated dental disease. We will then address the R00 phase through the following aims: 3) To better understand dental providers' perceptions of, attitudes toward, and experiences with Medicaid expansion and to explore ACA implementation challenges; and 4) To identify barriers to and facilitators of accessing oral health care after ACA expansion among Medicaid beneficiaries. By triangulating the views from both Medicaid providers and beneficiaries, we believe our approach will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the barriers and facilitators to ACA implementation. Findings from this study will enhance our understanding of barriers to access to oral health care that could inform future policies and interventions. Furthermore, it will aid in assessing national progress towards reducing socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in access to oral health services and explore mechanisms by which health policy could impact disparities in oral health. This career development award will provide me with protected research time and thus the opportunity to expand my research skills and knowledge. I will pursue further training in health policy, econometrics and mixed-methods research through didactic courses and formal advising from my mentors, who are experts in public health, health policy, health economics, health disparities, and qualitative methods. The setting of this award is at Harvard School of Dental Medicine and Harvard School of Public Health. This rich research environment will support my development as an independent researcher. Project Narrative Cost-related barriers to dental care are a major contributor to oral health inequalities. This study will examine the impact of health policy, the Affordable Care Act coverage expansion, on access to and utilization of dental services in the United States. Findings from this project will provide evidence to assess national progress towards reducing disparities in oral health and inform future policy development to improve access to dental care and reduce inequalities in oral health.",Health Reform and Oral Health Disparities: a Mixed Methods Evaluation,9597434,K99MD012253,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' Data Collection ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dentists ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"A Prospective Investigation of the Oral Microbiome and Pancreatic Cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer is a highly fatal disease (five-year survival rate of only 6%) with virtually no current opportunities for meaningful efforts towards primary or secondary prevention. It is the fourth most common cause of cancer death for both men and women in the US. African Americans are disproportionately burdened with the highest pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality rates in the US - about 30% higher than the group with the next highest rates, non-Hispanic whites. The current lack of knowledge on factors that could be useful for primary prevention or for identifying high-risk groups for potential screening or intervention is a major impediment to improving the poor outlook for this cancer. Evidence has been mounting, including pilot results generated for the current application, that commensal and pathogenic oral bacteria may play a role in pancreatic cancer development. If this is the case, and if the relevant characteristics of the oral microbiota can be identified, this could be a major breakthrough in our ability to prevent pancreatic cancer, because the oral ecology is modifiable. We see the emergence of new microbial gene sequencing and bioinformatics methods as a fundamental opportunity to study how oral microbial communities may contribute to pancreatic cancer risk and disparities. Leveraging the existing resources of two prospective, epidemiologic studies, the Southern Community Cohort Study and the Black Women's Health Study, we propose to substantially advance this emerging line of enquiry by conducting a comprehensive investigation of the oral microbiome and pancreatic cancer. We will do so within established parent cohorts that are uniquely situated to include African Americans (as well as European Americans) and to address potential racial differences in the oral microbiome as drivers of the excess burden of pancreatic cancer among African Americans. In a nested case-control study of 125 incident pancreatic cancer cases and 450 controls, using pre-diagnostic oral rinse samples, we will employ high-output genomic shotgun sequencing to characterize and compare the oral microbiome of cases and controls, hypothesizing that microbial abundance, diversity, and/or function will differ between these groups (Aim 1). Among the controls, we will also evaluate racial differences in the oral microbiome and identify any differences that may explain the increased incidence of pancreatic cancer among African Americans (Aim 2). We will further determine the association between recognized, modifiable risk factors for pancreatic cancer (cigarette smoking, obesity, red meat and processed meat consumption, alcohol consumption, type 2 diabetes) and oral microbiome attributes, and evaluate whether these exposures are associated with high-risk oral microbiome profiles (Aim 3). This study could have both immediate and long-term major impact by opening the doors for new mechanistic research as well as translational activities including manipulating the microbiome for cancer prevention, developing therapies related to the microbiome, and ultimately reducing the incidence of, and disparities in, pancreatic cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pancreatic cancer is a highly fatal disease with an enigmatic racial disparity and virtually no current opportunities for effective primary or secondary prevention efforts. The need for knowledge gains in these areas is thus profound. Prompted by mounting evidence that normal and pathogenic oral bacteria may play a role in pancreatic cancer development, the proposed investigation of the composition and function of the oral microbiome in relation to pancreatic cancer will provide some of the first prospective data addressing this novel question and could have immediate impact by spurring translational activities aimed at reducing the incidence of, and disparities in, pancreatic cancer.",A Prospective Investigation of the Oral Microbiome and Pancreatic Cancer,9540692,U01CA187508,"['Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', '

"Evaluation of Geographic Variation in Pediatric Preventive Dental Services PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over half of low income children in the U.S. have experienced tooth decay, one-third of whom have untreated decay. Tooth decay in children is largely preventable with routine dental care that includes professionally applied topical fluoride and dental sealants. However, low income children who are at the greatest risk of developing tooth decay are the least likely to receive these services – even if they do see a dentist for routine care. A large body of previous research has examined barriers to dental care and factors associated with preventive dental utilization from the patient perspective; limited research has focused on how dentist treatment patterns contribute to disparities. In this study, we will evaluate how regional patterns in clinical dental practice affect dentists' rates of providing preventive dental services to children who are at elevated risk for tooth decay. The outcome of interest is the proportion of children treated by each dentist who received preventive dental services, including rates of topical fluoride and dental sealant placement. Dentists' service patterns will be explored in the context of dental service areas – regional markets identified based on where patients travel to receive care. Variation in rates of preventive dental services will be examined at the individual dentist level, and variation within and among service areas will be estimated. The project aims are to: (1) assess provider-level variation in the provision of preventive dental services, (2) evaluate clinical practice variation within and across geographical regions, and (3) identify factors associated with increased preventive dental service rates. Our long-term goal is to explore the mechanisms by which local clinical treatment patterns develop in order to identify modifiable factors that can be leveraged by educational interventions to increase use of science-based information by dentists. The long- term impact of these interventions would be to increase use of preventive dental services and reduce oral health disparities in high risk populations. This proposed project addresses NIDCR's 2014-2019 Strategic Plan goal to overcome disparities in dental, oral, and craniofacial health. It also addresses Healthy People 2020 Oral Health Objectives 8, 12, and 14, which aim to increase the proportion of children and adolescents who receive preventive dental services. Dentists' propensity to provide evidence-based preventive dental services is potentially modifiable; findings from this study will support design of tailored educational interventions and policy. Targeting behavior change at the provider level could offer a cost-effective method to reduce oral health disparities in children by shifting treatment patterns towards prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will explore regional variation in the preventive dental services provided to children at elevated risk for tooth decay. Despite previous research demonstrating the effectiveness of topical fluoride and pit-and- fissure sealants in preventing tooth decay, relatively few children who see a dentist for routine care receive these services. Findings from this research will provide the initial knowledge needed to design interventions targeting dental providers that aim to increase provision of evidence-based preventive services to high-risk children.",Evaluation of Geographic Variation in Pediatric Preventive Dental Services,9807824,R03DE028963,"['Patients ', ' Dental Sealants ', ' Pit and Fissure Sealants ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Dental Schools ', ' Science ', ' Standardization ', ' Travel ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' HRSA ', ' United States Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Evaluation ', ' Dental ', ' Failure ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Knowledge ', ' Oral ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' craniofacial ', ' craniofacies ', ' experience ', ' Topical application ', ' topically applied ', ' topical treatment ', ' topical drug application ', ' topical delivery ', ' topical administration ', ' Topical Drug Administration ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' aged ', ' federal poverty level ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' routine care ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' pediatric patients ', ' child patients ', ' Preventive dental care ', ' Preventive dental service ', ' Preventative dental service ', ' Preventative dental care ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' welfare ', ' Service provision ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Service area ', ' Health Catchment Area ', ' Health Service Area ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Practice Variations ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dentists ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Topical Fluorides ', ' Foundations ', ' dental practice ', ' Dental General Practice ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Iowa ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Methods ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R03,2019,154500,0.17079006030401167
"Cross-sectional associations of oral microbiota with oral HPV infection among high-risk Hispanic adults PROJECT SUMMARY The rising rates of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancers in the U.S. is a significant public health issue, while Hispanics show increased burden of this malignancy. Recent research suggests differences in oral microbiota between oropharyngeal cancer cases and controls, and between HPV+ and HPV- individuals. Nonetheless, research evaluating the role of oral microbiota on oral HPV infection, a main risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer, is scarce, and essential to develop effective prevention strategies. The proposed cross-sectional study will recruit 300 participants from sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinics of Puerto Rico. The specific aims of this application are to (1) characterize the oral microbiota profiles of patients with and without oral HPV infection, and (2) assess the association between species-level oral microbiota and oral HPV infection. Participants will provide saliva samples for oral HPV detection, following the NHANES methodology, and for oral microbiota analysis. Socio-demographic, behavioral, dental, and medical characteristics will be collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Risk factors for oral HPV infection will be collected using the audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) methodology, a useful tool for collecting sensitive risk behavior data. HPV typing will be performed by dot-blot hybridization using 38 type-specific probes, including oncogenic and non-oncogenic types, while for microbiota, genomic DNA extractions and 16S rDNA V4 amplifications will be done. Samples will then be subjected to Illumina Miseq sequencing and data analyses. To our knowledge, this is the first study that will assess the association between the oral microbiota and oral HPV infection among a homogenous Hispanic population. Accumulating evidence supports a biological plausibility for the association between the microbiota and HPV infection in various anatomical sites and with oral cancer; however, data on its relationship with oral HPV infection is limited. The identification of the oral microbiota’s role on oral HPV infection may provide essential information for the development of preventive public health strategies, as if research shows that the oral microbiota modulates oral HPV infection and oral carcinogenesis, the implications for oral cancer prevention and control strategies might be important. PROJECT NARRATIVE Puerto Ricans are among the fastest growing segments of the U.S. Hispanic population, an ethnic group characterized by having high rates of HPV and oral cancer.

"OHEAL: Oral Health Equity in Alaska ABSTRACT: This R21 applicant did formative work on barriers to dental care and achieving good oral health for Alaska Native children (Grant No. UH2DE025488, PI J. Cunha-Cruz) in which it identified the absence of critical dental office-systems that providers need to implement evidence-based practices (EBP) proven to control dental caries (tooth decay). American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) children suffer from the poorest oral health of all population groups in the United States with 3 times higher rates of untreated caries than non- Hispanic white children. Despite great resilience, tribal nations face geographical isolation, dentist shortages and distrust in health care systems exacerbating disparities. The Oral Health Equity for Alaska (OHEAL) program initiated by the applicant in collaboration with a tribal healthcare organization (SouthEast Alaska Regional Health Consortium - SEARHC) and local tribal communities offers a unique opportunity to implement an evidence-based, culturally-appropriate and theory-informed program to disseminate EBPs to Alaska Native settings. The purpose of this R21 is to adapt and test feasibility of an implementation strategy prior to larger-scale implementation and evaluation. The rationale is that tribal dental services want to increase dental caries control efforts for children in remote villages, but lack evidence-based tools adapted to the AIAN culture and environment that can be implemented and maintained effectively and efficiently. Our SPECIFIC AIMS are: 1) to collaboratively develop and culturally adapt the caries control tools and strategies; 2) to test the feasibility of the caries control tools and strategies; and 3) to investigate the acceptability and appropriateness of the caries control tools and strategies among provider, community and patient stakeholders. METHODS: Workshops with tribal organization, patient and community stakeholders will be used to culturally adapt EBP guidelines and office-systems tools and strategies. Data from interviews and surveys with community, patient and organizational stakeholders, dental claims and administrative records will be used to assess acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility. A feasibility test of the program will be conducted. Guided by organizational and behavioral theory, triangulation of qualitative and quantitative findings will identify office-systems strategies likely to be used by AIAN and non-AIAN dental providers. We will learn which implementation strategies, provider behaviors, and contextual factors are likely to impact implementation and identify mechanisms essential for program success as well as aspects difficult to implement. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed R21 will lead to a R01 proposal for a larger-scale study. This preliminary research is significant and innovative because of its focus on 1) improving public health by increasing caries control for AIAN children and for its implications for greater adoption and replication by others serving minority, low income, rural communities, and 2) advancing knowledge of how and why adaption of implementation strategies for dissemination of EBPs is necessary. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This R21 on dissemination and implementation research is relevant to public health because adaptation of implementation strategies for the dissemination of evidence-based practices for control of dental caries (tooth decay) will lead to population-level reductions in disease, particularly for low income Alaska Native children and adolescents. This research will provide an understanding of how office-system changes can be culturally adapted to an Alaska Native workforce and community to successfully disseminate proven, low-cost interventions to eliminate health disparities. Thus, the proposed research addresses the NIH/NIMHD strategic plan to support research on the factors underlying health disparities; to enhance research capacity to create a culturally sensitive and culturally competent workforce; and to engage in proactive community outreach and information dissemination.",OHEAL: Oral Health Equity in Alaska,9789062,R21MD012868,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alaska ', ' Algorithms ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Dental Care Delivery ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dental Offices ', ' Dentists ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Feedback ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hearing ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Organizational Change ', ' Rural Community ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' health care service organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' health care organization ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' Employee ', ' novel ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health organization ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Population Group ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' research dissemination ', ' research data dissemination ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' tribal health ', ' tribe health ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Collection ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Monitor ', ' Behavioral ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' Minority ', ' tribal Nation ', ' tribal community ', ' tribal organization ', ' tribal board ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' implementation science ', ' community setting ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' health equity ', ' tribal healthcare ', ' tribal health care ', ' intervention cost ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2019,189783,0.15037205152749122
"Longitudinal Analysis of Low pH Streptococci and Plaque Microbiome in Early Childhood Caries ABSTRACT  The microbial etiology of dental caries remains a subject of debate with considerable differences of opinion regarding the relative contributions of specific species or classes of bacteria. The `low pH streptococci' is a designation given to atypical, highly acidogenic strains of oral streptococci originally thought to belong to the primary plaque colonizing species S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii, and S. anginosus. This sub-group of streptococci is proposed to have considerable cariogenic potential, perhaps preceding, augmenting or even overshadowing the contribution of the mutans streptococci (MS). However, assessing the role of the low pH strep is not straightforward. Accurate assignment of species among the viridans streptococci is a challenge, and the low pH phenotype cannot be ascertained by the gene-based strategies routinely employed in non-culture based studies of the oral microbiome. In this application we propose a unique prospective study that combines state-of-the-art bioinformatics with phenotypic analyses of low pH phenotypes to track changes in the plaque microbiome, with a specific focus on the MS and non-MS low pH streptococci, as caries develop in children at high risk for early childhood caries. Specifically, our objectives are to determine if there is ascendancy of non- MS low pH streptococci within the plaque oral microbiome with potential shifts in composition of other organisms during the transition from a sound enamel site to a carious enamel site. In addition, we propose a novel and exciting approach of categorizing low pH streptococci based on their potential to produce alkaline products. We believe that gaining a more comprehensive assessment of the low pH streptococcal species or taxa, and our novel grouping of these organisms based on alkaline-producing phenotypes, as part of our determination of the plaque microbiome composition has the potential to make significant contributions to implementation science. To meet our objectives we propose the following aims: 1) Conduct an 18-month longitudinal study on high-caries risk children aged 1-3 to determine changes in the overall plaque microbiome preceding caries development, with a focus on the non-MS low pH streptococci; and 2) Use genomic sequencing to assign species identity or taxonomical relatedness to the non-MS low pH streptococci recovered in Aim 1. By coalescing and analyzing the data from the microbiome and low pH streptococci as caries develop we will define patterns or drivers of caries or health that may provide a basis for advances in implementation science. NARRATIVE  A major influence on the development of dental decay is the composition of bacteria that comprise dental plaque. In the proposed study, we will examine the recoveries and proportions of a prominent group of plaque bacteria, the streptococci, from dental plaque samples collected from ages one to three in a population of children at a high risk for early childhood dental decay. We will compare the changes in streptococcal populations with the overall plaque microbiome composition to gain a better appreciation for the microbial contribution to dental decay so that more efficient means of risk assessment, treatment and prevention can be formulated.",Longitudinal Analysis of Low pH Streptococci and Plaque Microbiome in Early Childhood Caries,9707779,R01DE026716,"['Acid-Base Equilibrium ', ' Acid-Base Balance ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Bacteria ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth enamel ', ' Enamel ', ' Dental Enamel ', ' Dental Plaque ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Elements ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Iowa ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' dental development ', ' Odontogenesis ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Pathology ', ' Pedodontics ', ' Pediatric Dentistry ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Scoring Method ', ' sound ', ' Streptococcus ', ' S.mutans ', ' S. mutans ', ' S mutans ', ' Streptococcus mutans ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' exhaust ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Lesion ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Recovery ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Host Factor ', ' Streptococcus mitis ', ' Streptococcus mitior ', ' S.mitis ', ' S.mitior ', ' S. mitis ', ' S. mitior ', ' S mitis ', ' S mitior ', ' Streptococcus anginosus ', ' S.anginosus ', ' S. anginosus ', ' S anginosus ', ' Streptococcus Viridans Group ', ' viridans group streptococci ', ' Viridans Streptococci ', ' Streptococcus oralis ', ' S.oralis ', ' S. oralis ', ' S oralis ', ' Streptococcus gordonii ', ' S.gordonii ', ' S. gordonii ', ' S gordonii ', ' Research Priority ', ' Pattern ', ' pediatric department ', ' alkalinity ', ' basicity ', ' early childhood ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Genomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Streptococcus viridans ', ' S.viridans ', ' S. viridans ', ' S viridans ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Nutritional ', ' nutritious ', ' Grouping ', ' groupings ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' microbiome ', ' oral microbiome ', ' oral streptococci ', ' oral plaque ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' microbiome composition ', ' microbiome species composition ', ' microbiome community composition ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2019,486864,0.19728688772915784
"Statewide implementation and evaluation of a rural, school-based, caries prevention program SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Our long term goal is to reduce oral health disparities in rural school children.  Our immediate goal is to test two new evidence-based, school-based, cavity prevention programs.  We will compare two preventions: (1) A newer, simpler, less expensive, efficient treatment using fluoride varnish + silver diamine fluoride; and (2) A more traditional, complex, expensive, time-intensive treatment that includes simple + sealants + interim therapeutic restorations. The simpler method takes 6 minutes to deliver, compared to the more complex method that takes 20 minutes. Therefore, if the simpler, less expensive is as effective as the more complex, more expensive method, the data could support clinical and policy change.  To compare the two methods we will use a cluster randomized control trial design. We will implement this program in rural New Hampshire schools. All children in a school with informed consent will receive the same treatment (either simple or complex). We will provide preventive care twice per year for the 5 year grant period.  We will follow all children longitudinally for five years to determine the effectiveness of each preventive method. The primary outcome to make this determination will be the percentage of children with untreated decay. This is one of the U.S. Healthy People oral health goals. We will also examine the cost and cost- effectiveness. This will allow us to determine the balance between effectiveness and cost.  Assessing effectiveness and costs is particularly important for reducing disparities. If an intervention is quick, inexpensive, and 100% effective, that is a relatively simple choice. Most interventions are not 100% effective. Therefore, information on time, expense, and effectiveness will allow us to make better informed clinical and policy decisions. Specifically, this will help us answer the question: How much of which preventive intervention will increase access, improve health, and reduce costs? Project Narrative  Dental cavities are world’s most prevalent disease. In the U.S., almost 4 in 10 rural schoolchildren have untreated cavities. To improve the health of children we will test two new school- based cavity prevention programs to see which works best.","Statewide implementation and evaluation of a rural, school-based, caries prevention program",9691490,R01MD011526,"['youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Sources ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dental Hygienists ', ' Dental Records ', ' Dentists ', ' Diamines ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Fluorides ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' plan health ', ' Health Planning ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Institutes ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' New Hampshire ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Public Health ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Schools ', ' Ag element ', ' Silver ', ' Dental Societies ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' restoration ', ' elementary school ', ' grade school ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Monitor ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' implementation research ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' prevention efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' health equity ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Prevention trial ', ' trial design ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive measure ', ' Preventative measure ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' rural counties ', ' Child Health ', ' health goals ', ' ']",NIMHD,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,714645,0.1427255370948846
"Complex Systems Science Approaches to Addressing Oral Health Disparities Oral health disparities, particularly among children, continue to be a pressing problem in the US. While the oral health of children has improved overall, those from disadvantaged population groups continue to suffer from a greater than average disease burden. Oral health disparities reflect a complex set of pathways and mechanisms with bidirectional associations (feedback loops) that traverse the macro- and micro-levels of disease causation. The overall goal of this proposal is to facilitate the candidate’s long term career goal of becoming an independent social epidemiologist capable of investigating disease causation and prevention through a complex systems-based perspective. The current proposal aims to provide the candidate with the opportunity to develop the necessary skills and experience to achieve research independence by extending their formal training in epidemiology and applied experiences in oral health disparities research. Development activities proposed during the mentored phase are related to training the candidate in Complex Systems Science (CSS) approaches, namely social network analysis (SNA) and agent-based modeling (ABM). Training will occur through coursework, multidisciplinary mentoring and applied research experiences. The primary vehicle for development is the research plan. The proposed research aims to use CSS approaches to better understand the factors and mechanisms underlying oral health among a disadvantaged population, and to improve the strategies aimed at improving oral health, thereby reducing observed disparities. These approaches facilitate an understanding of the population, social interaction and environmental influence simultaneously and can explore interactions, feedback loops and reciprocity between independent and dependent variables. The first phase of the proposed work aims to develop a detailed conceptual model of oral health disparities that captures the multi-level mechanisms and will be used to inform the development of an agent-based model. ABM refers to the use of stochastic computer simulations to understand how the distribution of health and disease on a population level emerge from explicitly programmed health behaviors, social interactions and movements of simulated individuals over simulated time. An ABM of oral health and social networks among residents of public housing will be developed and utilized to identify viable intervention targets. The second phase of the work proposes to conduct a longitudinal SNA of adult caregivers of young children residing in public housing. SNA is an empirical tool that has been utilized to better understand the social context within which individuals interact. The planned analysis will serve to provide longitudinal data that can be used to validate the estimates of intervention targets obtained from the agent-based model. Additionally, the feasibility and acceptability of a potential network-based intervention will be evaluated within the sample. Completion of the described aims will represent one of the first applications of complex systems science methods to oral health disparities and demarcate the independent research career of the candidate. The proposed research aims to address oral health disparities using complex systems science approaches. Oral health disparities reflect a complex set of pathways and mechanisms with bidirectional associations (feedback loops) that traverse the macro- and micro-levels of disease causation.

"Social networks and oral health-related risk behaviors in public housing communities Social influences are important in the causes of oral health disparities and to changing health-related behaviors in disadvantaged populations. Conceptual models of children’s oral health include dynamic social pathways and the key role of caregivers’ knowledge, attitudes and behaviors. There is a critical lack of information about these pathways, particularly how social influences shape knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to oral health.  We propose to conduct a longitudinal sociometric network analysis among residents of public housing to better understand the factors that affect oral health-related risk behaviors. Although network science is relatively new to oral health disparities research, it is a well-established tool in other areas of health research. Understanding the role of social influences on the initiation and progression of oral disease is critical to the development, testing and implementation of effective behavioral interventions.  Our rationale is that by using network science to measure social interactions in a community, we will be able to define social network pathways that influence the risk-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviors that are associated with oral disease. Using knowledge about social influence that is gained from our research, future interventions may be tested and implemented that will prevent and reduce oral disease for those most at risk for oral disease.  Our specific aims are to: (1) Recruit and enroll a community of public housing residents to evaluate the structural properties of their social networks relevant to oral health risk-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviors at baseline and at 9- month intervals over two time points,  (2) Identify and quantify the exogenous and endogenous factors associated with the observed network structures and,  (3) Determine the association between the composition and structure of networks and oral health risk-related knowledge, attitudes and/or behaviors over time.  Public housing residents are a high impact, high-reward population for the study of oral health disparities because they involve spatial clustering of poverty and poor health. This produces a unique social climate and associated stigma for study that is not seen in other disadvantaged communities.  Our research will study network systems that influence social behaviors that are associated with oral disease and health disparities. Findings from our proposed observational study of public housing communities will help to inform the design of interventions that respond to the complex system dynamics of populations affected by health disparities. Oral health disparities, particularly among children, continue to be a pressing problem in the United States. Traditional approaches to the study of oral health disparities have failed to account for the multi-level factors that influence behavior, resulting in partial understanding of why oral health disparities persist and interventions fail to produce meaningful results.

"Rural Urban Disparities and Determinants of Dental Services and Provider Mix Project summary Increasing access to preventive and therapeutic oral health services is among the objectives of Healthy People 2020. Disparities in access to these services exist for disadvantaged populations, particularly in rural communities. The proposed research frames oral health care disparities as a complex system with multiple interacting individual and contextual factors. This research is timely in providing important information for future dental workforce preparation to address needs in rural areas. This study will also inform states in designing dental benefits for adults in implementing health reform initiatives. The proposed study will use data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) (1999- 2015) and the Area Health Resource Files (AHRF). The three specific aims of the study are: Aim 1: Identify trends in urban-rural (/racial/ethnic) differences in dental services and provider types. Aim 2: Define the contributions and cross-level interactions of individual and contextual factors (e.g. per capita dentists) related to dental services and providers. Aim 3: Assess the effects of Medicaid expansion on oral health care disparities among adults. Our study will establish a trend of urban-rural disparities in the type of dental services individuals receive and differences in the types of dental providers, and provide baseline data on the effects of Medicaid expansion (Aims 1 & 3). This study will contribute to a better understanding of facilitators and barriers to oral health care (Aim 2). Collectively, the study will provide evidence on rural-urban/racial/ethnic disparities in dental services in the US, which can inform current and future initiatives to improve oral health in rural communities. The results are expected to have a positive impact by providing high-quality information on oral health care in the US for better planning of oral health care and dental workforce development and distribution. Project Narrative The proposed study will provide a comprehensive yet detailed examination of the delivery and quality of dental care in rural America during 1999-2015 by (1) systematically assessing the trend of dental services and dental professional mix, (2) assessing multilevel relationships between factors related to the types of dental services received and providers visited, and (3) assessing the effects of Medicaid expansion on rural and racial/ethnic oral health disparities among adults. Such evidence will be important for preparing the future dental workforce, formulating new interventions and programs that meet community needs to improve oral health, and designing Medicaid benefit packages in the future.",Rural Urban Disparities and Determinants of Dental Services and Provider Mix,9735205,R03DE027436,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Communities ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dentists ', ' Expenditure ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' dental practice ', ' Dental General Practice ', ' Goals ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' dental health insurance ', ' Periodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontia insurance ', ' Oral Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Insurance ', ' Medicaid ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Patients ', ' Philosophy ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rural Health ', ' Rural Population ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Tooth Extraction ', ' Urban Population ', ' Tooth Loss ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Rural Community ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Reform ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Therapeutic ', ' permanent tooth ', ' Secondary Dentition ', ' Permanent Dentition ', ' Adult Dentition ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' health care service organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' health care organization ', ' intervention program ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' trend ', ' Preparation ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' rural disparities ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' defined contribution ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Workforce Development ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' urban disparity ', ' rural America ', ' service providers ', ' ']",NIDCR,EAST CAROLINA UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,143081,0.26214974036334765
"Coordinated Oral Health Promotion (CO-OP) Chicago ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Almost half of children 11 years old and younger suffer from dental caries, making caries one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood. Low income and minority children bear a disproportionate portion of this burden. In Chicago, these disparities are obvious with 63% of Chicago-area 3rd-graders having dental caries and over half of these caries are untreated. Pediatric dental caries are associated with pain, more severe infections, malnutrition, speech difficulties, poor school performance, cosmetic problems, and an overall lower quality of life. While many oral health interventions have been developed to reduce the incidence of caries, even the most successful programs have limited effectiveness in high risk children. The delivery and receipt of proper preventive oral healthcare involves social and environmental factors that operate on individual, family, and community levels. Multi-level interventions recognize the need to target these levels simultaneously but multi-level oral health interventions for the primary prevention of dental caries are lacking. COordinated Oral health Promotion (CO-OP) Chicago brings together a team of clinical pediatricians and dentists, researchers, health psychologists, and policy experts to rigorously test the ability of an oral health promotion intervention to improve child and family oral health. The primary intervention is family-focused education and support from community health workers (CHWs); this intervention will be applied in a range of settings to determine which settings, or combination of settings, result in the best outcomes. The Aim of the UH2 Phase is to formalize partnerships and finalize study design and protocol. This includes: 1) A formative assessment to determine partner operations, resources, and needs; 2) CHW training; 3) Pilot testing of recruitment and intervention protocols; 4) Creation of a final Manual of Procedures; and 5) Obtain clearances/contracts from all institutional and community partners. The UH3 Phase then implements and evaluates the intervention in 15 clinics, 15 WIC sites, and 1520 individual families. Aim 1 is to evaluate the ability of a clinic-based family-focused CHW intervention to improve child oral health; Aim 2 evaluates the ability of a WIC-based family-focused CHW intervention to improve child oral health; Aim 3 evaluates the ability of a home-based family-focused CHW intervention to improve child oral health; and Aim 4 determines the added value of combining interventions. The hypothesis is that participants receiving home-based CHWs and clinic-based or WIC-based CHW interventions will have the best oral health outcomes at 12-months. The primary outcome is incidence of early childhood caries, determined by the Caries Severity Index. The study will also employ the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) to evaluate program effectiveness. The results of this study have the potential to influence oral health programming, workforce development, and reimbursement on the local, state, and national level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  COordinated Oral health Promotion (CO-OP) Chicago will test the impact of a family-focused community health worker intervention for oral health promotion when applied alone in clinical, WIC, and home settings, and when applied in combination.

"Phase III RCT of the Effectiveness of Silver Diamine Fluoride in Arresting Cavitated Caries Lesions Summary The proposed Cooperative Agreement is for support for a Phase III randomized clinical trial (RCT) to assess the effectiveness of 38% silver diamine fluoride (SDF). SDF recently became available in the U.S., and is non-invasive, inexpensive and simple to use for management of cavitated lesions exposing dentin clinically (i.e., holes) in primary teeth. Early childhood caries (ECC) continues to be one of the most prevalent chronic conditions among U.S. children. It also is one of the most common unmet healthcare needs of poor children (e.g., Head Start children). If allowed to progress untreated for long periods of time, the disease can have broad dental, medical, social, and quality of life consequences. ECC and severe-ECC (e.g., multiple cavitated lesions or at least one caries lesion in the anterior teeth, with onset at an early age) is relatively inexpensive to prevent, yet becomes extremely burdensome on the children and families, and expensive to treat once lesions cavitate (e.g., with stainless steel crowns, extractions, etc.). This is especially true in young children who need extensive treatment, or are uncooperative and/or have immature cognitive functioning, disabilities, or medical conditions, where treatment under general anesthesia, in most cases in hospital operating rooms, is the standard of care. In 2016, the FDA issued a notice to health care providers that general anesthesia in young children can result in permanent neurological damage and should be avoided. Thus, better strategies are needed to successfully manage cavitated caries lesions in young children. The proposed RCT will be accomplished by targeting young children enrolled in Head Start programs who have cavitated caries lesions that have exposed dentin clinically. Because of the Breakthrough Therapy Status for SDF, FDA has been heavily involved in the design of this trial to ensure it will meet the requirements for a cavitated caries lesion “arrest” drug claim, which is innovative in the U.S. The proposed protocol in this application has been submitted by Advantage Silver Dental Arrest, LLC, holder of IND 124808, to the FDA as part of our collaboration. In the first months of funding, we will work with NIDCR to review all relevant study documents and manuals for the RCT, submit to IRBs, and calibrate all study examiners. Following this study preparation period, an experienced research team will conduct a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled superiority trial, with two parallel groups involving a total of 1,040 children, 2-5 years old, who will be followed over a period of 8 months, to assess: The tooth-Aim 1 (Primary study aim)- the impact of 38% SDF applied twice, 6 months apart, on arrest of cavitated lesions in the primary dentition (assessed using the ICDAS II severity and activity criteria). Secondary aims will further assess whether the provision of SDF impacts: the child-Aim 2 [effects of SDF on children's pain and pulpal infection], and the family-Aim 3 [effects of SDF on oral health-related quality of life (Sub-Aim 3a), and treatment satisfaction and acceptability (Sub-Aim 3b)]. The immediate impact and significance of this innovative project is that provision of and access to a non-invasive, inexpensive, and simple to use alternative strategy to manage cavitated caries lesions for children with limited access to care could profoundly improve oral health by arresting lesions, reducing pain, improving quality of life, and significantly reducing costs, all contributing to substantial reductions in disparities in caries. Project Narrative: The University of Michigan, in collaboration with researchers at New York University, the University of Iowa, Indiana University, the University of Otago, and consultants from the University of Hong Kong and University of Maryland propose to implement a Phase III multicenter, randomized clinical trial (RCT), to test the effectiveness of 38% Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF) in stopping the progression of cavities (i.e., large holes which result from dental caries, a common and debilitating disease) in the teeth of young children. Should the trial be successful, the impact would be a change in the standard of care and expanded access to a simple, non-invasive, inexpensive strategy to manage cavitated caries lesions in young children in the U.S., which otherwise are usually treated with potentially damaging general anesthesia and fillings or extractions. Access to this simple treatment should result in a reduction of disparities in access to care, and improvements in oral health, which addresses the NIDCR Strategic Plan Goal 3 [to apply rigorous, multidisciplinary research approaches to overcome disparities in dental, oral, and craniofacial health].",Phase III RCT of the Effectiveness of Silver Diamine Fluoride in Arresting Cavitated Caries Lesions,9751647,U01DE027372,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' General Anesthesia ', ' Calibration ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Informed Consent Forms ', ' Informed Consent Documents ', ' Consent Documents ', ' Consent Forms ', ' Crowns ', ' Dental crowns ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dentin ', ' Diamines ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Fluorides ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hongkong ', ' Hong Kong ', ' Hospitals ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Indiana ', ' Infection ', ' Iowa ', ' Manuals ', ' Maryland ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' New York ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Placebos ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Safety ', ' Ag element ', ' Silver ', ' Stainless Steel ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' dentalgia ', ' dental pain ', ' Odontalgia ', ' Toothache ', ' Universities ', ' Dental White Spots ', ' White Spots ', ' Work ', ' Deciduous Dentition ', ' Primary Dentition ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' Drug Approval ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Anterior ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Dental ', ' disability ', ' Visual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' craniofacial ', ' craniofacies ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Head Start ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Agreement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Nervous System Trauma ', ' neurotrauma ', ' Neurological trauma ', ' Neurological Injury ', ' Neurological Damage ', ' Nervous System damage ', ' Nervous System Injuries ', ' Modeling ', ' Documentation ', ' chemical resource ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' U-Series Cooperative Agreements ', ' Cooperative Agreements ', ' Improve Access ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Case Report Form ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' oral care ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' cost effective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 5 year old ', ' five years of age ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 years of age ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' effectiveness clinical trial ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' Secure ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' screening ', ' trial design ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' recruit ', ' pain reduction ', ' reduce pain ', ' off-label use ', ' off-label prescribing ', ' off-label application ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,3498346,0.16436086854165302
"Sensory Adapted Dental Environments to Enhance Oral Care for Children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, which builds upon our previous R34 NIDCR Planning and Feasibility study, is designed to examine the efficacy of a sensory adapted dental environment (SADE) to enhance children's oral care. Two groups will be studied: children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and typically developing (TD) children. Children with ASD, and a subset of TD children, exhibit sensory over-responsivity when confronted with experiential aspects of dental visits such as exposure to bright fluorescent lighting, touch in or around the mouth, or the texture and smell of various oral care products. This often results in increased anxiety and negative behavioral responses, which hinder the dentist's ability to perform treatment. In the proposed project, we test a SADE intervention designed to reduce children's anxiety and negative responses during oral care. The SADE intervention includes adaptations such as dimmed lighting, moving projections on the ceiling (fish, bubbles), exposure to soothing music, and application of a butterfly vest with wings that wrap around the child to provide calming sensations.  The specific aims are to conduct a randomized clinical trial in order to: 1. Determine if SADE, relative to a regular dental environment (RDE), reduces physiological anxiety and negative responses (behavioral distress, perception of pain, sensory discomfort) during dental cleaning for children with ASD and TD children and test whether SADE's effect is greater for the ASD group. 2. Identify whether physiological anxiety mediates the beneficial effects of the intervention and whether severity of ASD and communication ability (ASD group), or dental anxiety, sensory over-responsivity, and age (both groups) act as moderating variables. 3. Assess the quality of care and cost effectiveness/savings of the dental cleaning associated with SADE.  Research participants will be 220 ethnically diverse children aged 6-12 years, 110 with ASD and 110 TD. Using a randomized counterbalanced study design, each child will undergo two dental cleanings four months apart: one dental cleaning in RDE and one dental cleaning in SADE.  This project is significant because it is the first full-scale trial of an intervention designed to reduce oral care problems in children with ASD. It is theoretically important because it will elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the effects of the SADE intervention and help to identify which subgroups of children, both TD and with ASD, which will benefit most from this approach. Based on the study findings, we will develop a model to transform the standard of pediatric dental care by modifying the sensory qualities of the dental environment; this model will have the potential to be utilized in dental clinics worldwide. As such the project promises to have a major public health impact insofar as the potential gains in oral health, child comfort, and cost-savings will be dramatic, potentially applying to more than one-fourth of all children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), as well as many typically developing children, exhibit sensory over-responsivity in response to the bright lights, sounds, and touch at the dental office, making dental care challenging for such populations. In this study we will test an intervention that alters the sensory characteristics of he dental environment in order to decrease children's physiological anxiety and negative responses during oral care and contribute to increased child comfort as well as safer, more efficient, and less costly treatment. If successful, this intervention has the potential to revolutionize clinic-based dental care for the growing population of children with ASD, as well as for typically developing children with dental anxiety and/or sensory over-responsivity.",Sensory Adapted Dental Environments to Enhance Oral Care for Children,9688861,U01DE024978,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' General Anesthesia ', ' Anxiety ', ' Butterflies ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Care ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Clinics ', ' Dental Offices ', ' Dentists ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Fishes ', ' Goals ', ' Illumination ', ' Lighting ', ' Music ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Savings ', ' Sensation ', ' Esthesia ', ' olfactory perception ', ' odor perception ', ' Smell ', ' Olfaction ', ' Smell Perception ', ' sound ', ' taste response ', ' taste processing ', ' gustatory response ', ' gustatory processing ', ' gustatory perception ', ' Taste ', ' Gustation ', ' Taste Perception ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Wing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Odontophobia ', ' Dental Phobia ', ' Dental Fear ', ' Dental Anxiety ', ' Cost Savings ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' autistic children ', ' children with autism spectrum disorder ', ' children with autism ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Dental ', ' Distress ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Visual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Crossover Design ', ' Cross-Over Designs ', ' Exposure to ', ' Sedation procedure ', ' sedation ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Tactile ', ' Auditory ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Reaction ', ' Sensory ', ' Texture ', ' Visit ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Touch sensation ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' U-Series Cooperative Agreements ', ' Cooperative Agreements ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' oral care ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' successful intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' pain perception ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2019,1583530,0.1820503375774249
"Reducing Oral Health Disparities in Children: Assessing the Multilevel Impact of a Standardized Preventive Dental Care System Supplement Abstract This application is being submitted in response to NOT-MD-19-023. Research examining prevalence of dental caries in children has found higher prevalence among low-income children, but for some racial/ethnic groups there are additional disparities even when income and insurance status has been controlled for. This intersection has not been explored within the Native Hawaiian / Other Pacific Islander (NH/OPI) pediatric population. Our long-term goal is to reduce disparities in children’s oral health, largely by improving dental care quality through evidence-based prevention and treatment. Understanding the dental care system’s role in creating or mitigating oral health disparities or improving oral health has been limited to simplistic access metrics (e.g., annual dental visit) and procedures billed (e.g., dental treatment) which only allow general comparisons heavily confounded by quality of care and insurance type. We know little about how caries risk status, diagnoses, preventive therapies, and interventions are linked to oral health in specific individuals and in populations over time. This gap in knowledge can now be overcome through our study of a caries prevention program. The program is built into a system that includes a standardized model of diagnosis-driven, risk- based, clinical-decision-supported care documented in an electronic health record (EHR) and implemented at a dental accountable care organization serving both commercially insured and Medicaid patients. The proposed study supplement will enable novel assessment detailed disease patterns and health disparities of Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (NH/OPI) children through additional in-depth analysis. This study will leverage sophisticated dental informatics allowing us to use big data to measure and comparatively examine untreated caries and new caries incidence over time in the context of real-world clinical care. Additionally, using Oregon Medicaid claims data we can assess the delivery system impact and by conducting focus groups we will identify impactful patient centered care considerations that can potentially predict the success of intervention – all critical information to inform future quality improvement and implementation efforts. Project Narrative Dental caries (cavities) is the most common disease of childhood, causing significant costs to individuals and society. This supplement will specifically evaluate the impact of a clinical evidence-based approach to pediatric oral health care on its capacity to reduce socioeconomic oral health disparities in untreated caries and new caries incidence of Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (NH/OPI) children in Oregon.

"Social Network Dynamics and Oral Health Disparities in Mexican American Immigrants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos in the US experience substantial oral health disparities (OHD). They face barriers to accessing oral health services (e.g., among the lowest rates of dental insurance among any racial or ethnic group), and are disproportionately less likely to seek regular and preventive dental care. Latino children and adults also experience higher rates of dental caries, gingivitis, and/or chronic periodontitis. Studies of oral health among Latinos have been limited to identifying individual-level socioeconomic and sociocultural mechanisms, with little attention to broader personal and community network contexts. Viewed from a network science perspective, the health behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes of individuals are shaped through contact and communication with others; there is a strong relationship between social networks and health outcomes. The current oral health research toolbox does not adequately capture the multiple nested levels of influence embodied in OHD. We propose to apply Social Network Analysis (SNA) methods to address the critical need to understand how social norms, attitudes, resources, and information around dental care and oral health propagate through personal and community networks, and affect individual behavior and outcomes. In the proposed research we will build on our completed formative project (NIDCR DE022096), a pioneer study using SNA methods in OHD research targeting people of Mexican descent (or Mexican-Americans [MAs]) in the US. In that prior cross-sectional design we characterized experiences about food, oral health behaviors, and dental care in the context of the networks they live in. Describing OHD factors and mechanisms affecting MAs has great public health significance because the MA sub-group makes up about 60% of Latinos in the US. In the present longitudinal design, we will develop a strong causal model of OHD by focusing on the dynamic processes underlying the coevolution of networks, oral health culture, and dental care attitudes and behaviors over time among MAs who have recently immigrated. Our specific aims are to: 1) characterize the norms, attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions of barriers around dental care and oral health among MA immigrants, with specific attention to associations between these factors and personal social network features; and 2) determine the relationships between acculturation, personal and community network dynamics, diffusion of norms and resources, and evolving oral health behaviors, attitudes, and outcomes over time among MA immigrants. Having additional, and more accurate knowledge about the complex and dynamic mechanisms underlying OHD will provide a foundation to develop four aspects: effective public policy, efficient clinical guidelines, culturally-sensitive clinical and preventive care, and futur research directions with practical applications. Moreover, drawing on the rich body of existing research on network interventions and diffusion of innovation from other health areas, our findings can be applied to tailoring programs that leverage the strengths and resources of MA communities to improve population oral health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Latino population - the largest and fastest growing ethnic group in the US - has significant barriers to dental services and is afflicted by large oral health disparities. Attempts to address such problems through individual behavior change have been largely unsuccessful because little is known about the complex network dimensions in which patterns of oral health self-care and dental services utilization take place. The proposed research will study one Latino community to trace relationships over time between acculturation, personal and community network dynamics, diffusion of norms and resources, and experiences of oral health, to yield a solid base for effective public policy and culturally-sensitive clinicalcare.",Social Network Dynamics and Oral Health Disparities in Mexican American Immigrants,9676894,R01DE025836,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Attitude to Health ', ' health attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Biology ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Diffusion ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Evolution ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gingivitis ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services ', ' Immigration ', ' dental health insurance ', ' Periodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontic insurance ', ' Orthodontia insurance ', ' Oral Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Surgery Insurance ', ' Dental Insurance ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Oral Characters ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Perception ', ' Chronic Periodontitis ', ' Periodontitis ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Time ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Assimilations ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Mexican ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Community Networks ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' social ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Subgroup ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' practical application ', ' application in practice ', ' service utilization ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' longitudinal design ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' causal model ', ' causal diagram ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive dental care ', ' Preventive dental service ', ' Preventative dental service ', ' Preventative dental care ', ' ']",NIDCR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2019,1197024,0.292608069445997
"Developing a Tailored, Web-delivered, Motivational Interviewing-based Intervention to Promote Oral Health To address a persistent “silent epidemic” of oral diseases in the United States and reduce associated health disparities, a new paradigm for promoting oral health behavior change is urgently needed. Patient education and risk-reduction counseling have been identified as central components of an overall plan for preventing oral disease. However, the typical approach of dental professionals is to provide oral hygiene advice, demonstration, or instruction, which generally have little impact on behavior. Although motivational interviewing (MI) has received support as a method for promoting oral health behavior change, constraints in dental practice settings limit the practicality of such counseling. As a step toward developing novel, effective, high-impact approaches to promoting behaviors that reduce risks for oral disease, the present application proposes a mixed methods research project to develop a web-delivered adaptation of MI for increasing patients' health-promoting behavior (e.g., oral hygiene) and decreasing their health-risk behavior (e.g. tobacco and other substance use). This program would be the first technology-delivered adaptation of MI to be designed expressly for oral health promotion and the first web-delivered intervention to address all aspects of oral health-related behavior. This approach would represent a dramatic shift away from current practice in dental care settings and has the potential to yield substantial reductions in oral health disparities. The proposed project has three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will entail developing an initial prototype of the program. For this purpose, stakeholder recommendations will be gathered in focus group interviews with 32 dental patients and 32 dental professionals, content from a previously developed manual for face-to-face MI-based oral health promotion will be translated into elements suitable for inclusion in the program, feedback on design concepts will be obtained from 8 patients, and a full-featured prototype program will be developed. Aim 2 will entail a minimum of two iterations of usability and acceptability testing and subsequent program refinement, with 8 patients participating in each iteration. Aim 3 will entail administering the program to 24 dental patients in a public health dental clinic context and evaluating the extent to which they perceive the program as engaging, relevant, and possessing MI-consistent features expected to motivate change in oral health-related behavior. Achieving these aims will yield a theory-based intervention with demonstrated usability and acceptability and will support a subsequent application for an NIDCR R34 Behavioral Clinical Trial Planning Grant (PAR-14-342) to document feasibility and proposed procedures of a clinical trial. These activities would, in turn, support an application under NIDCR’s U01 Clinical Trial Cooperative Agreement (PAR-15-059) mechanism to test the program’s ability to yield improvements in oral health behavior and reductions in oral disease. Subsequent adaptation also would permit intervention with individuals not currently receiving services (e.g., via a public website) and to specific populations at heightened risk (e.g., due to diabetes, substance use, or HIV infection). Project Narrative This project will improve public health by developing a theory-based, web-delivered intervention to promote healthy behavior in dental patients. This work will lay the groundwork for future demonstrations of the intervention’s feasibility and effectiveness in dental practice settings.","Developing a Tailored, Web-delivered, Motivational Interviewing-based Intervention to Promote Oral Health",9784795,R21DE028084,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Behavior ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Counseling ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dental Clinics ', ' Dental Hygienists ', ' Dentists ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' dental practice ', ' Dental General Practice ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patients ', ' periodontium disorder ', ' periodontium disease ', ' periodontal disorder ', ' Parodontosis ', ' Periodontal Diseases ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Competence ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Ensure ', ' Dental ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' programs ', ' Reaction ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' U-Series Cooperative Agreements ', ' Cooperative Agreements ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Update ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' Instruction ', ' Information Technology ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' behavioral clinical trial ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Health behavior change ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' urban public health ', ' Patient risk ', ' racial minority ', ' practice setting ', ' ']",NIDCR,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R21,2019,199375,0.3044542515392373
"Randomized Efficacy Trial of MySmileBuddy, a Family-centered Behavioral Intervention to Reduce Early Childhood Caries ABSTRACT/ PROJECT SUMMARY Longstanding practice has treated early childhood caries (ECC) primarily through surgical dental repair, reinforced by current payment systems, an approach that does not address the natural history of the disease or the oral hygiene and dietary behaviors that mediate its occurrence. Professional consensus on the value of ECC disease management is emerging but behavioral strategies remain largely unstudied among Hispanic children in the United States. The long-term goal of the proposed study is to reduce oral health disparities and inform a paradigm shift from a focus on treatment to one that also embraces prevention. It is known that using fluoridated toothpaste twice daily and consumption of a low cariogenic diet has both preventive and therapeutic value. What is not known is how to best translate the adoption and maintenance of salutary behaviors to populations at greatest risk. The proposed randomized controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy of a family focused behavioral intervention, MySmileBuddy, to reduce ECC progression in high-risk Hispanic preschoolers. We propose to recruit and enroll 858 two to five year-old children, all with ECC, along with their caregiver from pediatric medical clinics in northern Manhattan, New York City. Specific Aims are: (1) to assess MySmileBuddy's efficacy (versus control) to decrease ECC progression (defined as positive change in number of decayed, missing, or filled teeth (∆dmft>0) or surfaces (∆dfs>0)) measured 12-months post-randomization (and assessed again 24-months post-randomization); (2) to assess MySmileBuddy's efficacy (versus control) to enhance adoption of twice daily fluoridated toothpaste use and consumption of a low cariogenic diet; and (3) to assess causal pathways through which MySmileBuddy influences twice daily fluoridated toothpaste use and consumption of a low cariogenic diet. The proposed research is innovative and represents a departure from the status quo by shifting focus from treatment to prevention, shifting education from verbal instructions and written materials provided by dental professionals to using interactive Health Information Technology delivered by Community Health Workers, and capitalizing on general pediatrics practices as a conduit for promoting children's oral health. At the completion of this study, we will know the extent to which MySmileBuddy promotes parents' acquisition and maintenance of oral hygiene and dietary behaviors that reduce ECC progression in a high-risk population of Hispanic preschool children. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to reduce the number of children needlessly affected by this preventable disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Affecting more than one-in-four children under age six, tooth decay in young children is common and harmful, yet largely preventable. The proposed research is relevant to the public's health by testing a novel family- centered program's ability to help families learn and practice healthful behaviors, stop decay from progressing in children who already have cavities, and explain how and why the program works.","Randomized Efficacy Trial of MySmileBuddy, a Family-centered Behavioral Intervention to Reduce Early Childhood Caries",9784788,U01DE026739,"['Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' American ', ' early childhood ', ' disease natural history ', ' novel ', ' payment ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Health Educators ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Instruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' efficacy trial ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 5 year old ', ' five years of age ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 years of age ', ' high risk ', ' community setting ', ' health information technology ', ' personalized care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' individualized care ', ' Precision care ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' recruit ', ' Academy ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' Preschool Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' Counseling ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Cariogenic Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Family ', ' fluoridation ', ' Water fluoridation ', ' Goals ', ' Hygiene ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Motivation ', ' New York City ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Parents ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Pedodontics ', ' Pediatric Dentistry ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Testing ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' dental disorder ', ' dental disease ', ' Tooth Disorder ', ' Tooth Diseases ', ' Toothpaste ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Dental ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Nutritionist ', ' Individual ', ' ']",NIDCR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2019,789556,0.1671116241477828
"Great Beginnings for Healthy Native Smiles PROJECT SUMMARY Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is the most common chronic disease among children. American Indian (AI) children are 4 times more likely to have untreated dental decay than white children. If left untreated, ECC can lead to chronic pain, loss of teeth, poor nutrition, and impaired growth. The proposed study aims to reduce the burden of ECC in two AI communities through an innovative, community based participatory approach. The project will: 1) partner with 2 tribes, the Hopi Tribe (Arizona) and the Crow Tribe (Montana), to conduct a formative assessment on oral health (OH); 2) adapt a “bundled” best practices OH intervention to be locally and contextually relevant for each of our tribal communities; and 3) conduct a randomized, controlled study to evaluate the impact of the “bundled” best practices OH intervention (compared to a standard prenatal/postnatal healthy lifestyle intervention) on the reduction of ECC. Community health representatives (CHRs) will be trained to deliver the interventions with pregnant women and follow them until the child’s last exam (24-36 months). The OH intervention will consist of 4 intervention components known to be effective (best practices) in the prevention of ECC: 1) dietary and OH education provided during pregnancy and the postnatal period; 2) OH care of children including the application of fluoride varnish; 3) motivational interviewing with children’s mothers; and 4) patient navigation of existing OH and other social services in each study community, facilitated by CHRs. Caries experience (dmfs) and severity will be compared across both conditions at the 1, 2, and 3- year exams. Mother knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to ECC will be also measured for both conditions at pre-test and post-test. Surveys will assess each level of the social ecological model. Individual level domains will include: 1) demographics of mother and baby (pre-test only); 2) dental health of the child to date; 3) mother’s and child’s OH (postnatal); 4) mother’s knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes about best practices in OH; 5) mother’s perception of self-efficacy and susceptibility; and 6) mother’s prenatal health and experiences. Interpersonal level domains will include: 1) current living situation and family support; 2) availability of emotional, informational, and instrumental support; and 3) perceptions of peers’ and family members’ attitudes toward caregiving and OH. Community level domains will include: 1) tribal identity and related experiences; 2) care coordination, transportation, and access to social and OH services; and 3) perceptions of cultural congruence of CHR interactions and intervention materials. If successful, this community-based approach may prove to be a feasible method for improving OH of AI children and reducing the burden of ECC in many Native communities with limited access to regular dental care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is the most common chronic disease affecting young children. American Indian children are particularly burdened by untreated dental caries and decay, which can lead to chronic pain, loss of teeth, poor nutrition, impaired growth, and may become aggressive if left untreated.

"Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia ABSTRACT  Oral disease, in particular childhood caries, remains a major health burden which affects some communities disproportionally, including regions of Appalachia. Both increased sugar intake and frequency of exposure alter the oral microbial community, triggering a disease process that leads to caries. Additional factors associated with caries in children include genetic risk, household SES, maternal caregiving behavior and stress, access to care. Progress has been made in understanding many of these factors. However, much remains to be done in order to further characterize individual risk factors, but just as importantly, to determine how interactions between them lead to oral health disparities.  The current proposal is a renewal of our ongoing project (R01-DE-014899) to identify factors contributing to the oral health disparity seen in northern Appalachia. The guiding philosophy of our project (the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia; COHRA) has been and continues to be that developing strategies to address this disparity requires simultaneous study of multiple risk components (ideally within families) to determine their roles, interactions among them, and their transmissibility patterns. COHRA's long- term goal remains to determine the sources of oral health disparity in a high risk, Northern Appalachian population so that effective preventive interventions can be designed and targeted.  During the previous project period that began Sept 1, 2009, we recruited a cohort of approximately 1000 northern Appalachian women during pregnancy (COHRA2), following them and their children through their children's second birthday. This prospective study of mother-child pairs complements the original cohort of approximately 840 northern Appalachian families (COHRA1) by gathering multifaceted, longitudinal data on the earliest antecedents of caries formation. As detailed in the progress report, the specific aims of the previous project period (using both COHRA1 and COHRA2 cohorts) were all accomplished (recruitment targets, genetic analyses of the COHRA1 cohort, psychosocial investigations, microbial assessments). We propose to follow the current COHRA2 cohort as it grows from ages 2 to 6, and to use the resulting longitudinal demographic, medical, diet, and psychosocial data to test hypotheses about the causal relationships between risk factors contributing to the unusually high rates of caries formation in this population. We will integrate the additional data to be collected with existing and new genetic and microbial data to identify “cariogenic profiles,” in which the interactions between mother and child genetics, oral ecology, diet, and other environmental/psychosocial behaviors in infancy and early childhood are combined to predict unusually high risks for onset of caries before age 6. NARRATIVE Oral disease, in particular childhood caries, remains a major health burden which affects some communities disproportionally, including regions of Appalachia.

"Predicting Caries Risk in Underserved Children, from Toddlers to the School-Age Years, in Primary Healthcare Settings Project Summary/Abstract: Dental caries, one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood, is a largely preventable disease, yet approximately 23% of U.S. children 2-5 years-of-age experience dental caries, and this number more than doubles to 56% among those aged 6-8. In the current environment of escalating healthcare costs and resource constraints, the large disparities in caries experience and access to care that exist in the U.S., especially among low socioeconomic status (SES) and minority population groups, call for a greater focus on targeted (at the patient and tooth surface level), risk-based caries preventive and therapeutic strategies to be delivered through interprofessional partnerships, including primary healthcare settings. Our team has just finished following 1,326 children from age 1 to age 4, and we have started data analyses to validate a caries risk questionnaire for use by medical providers to accurately identify high caries risk toddlers. The problem is that, while caries experience more than doubles from ages 2-5 to 6-8, caries in primary teeth during mixed dentition is a largely neglected area of research and prevention, there is no validated caries risk tool for medical settings to easily help triage 5- 8 year old children, and there have been almost no studies following the life-course progression of caries in children 1-8. This information is critically important, as designing and targeting efficacious and cost-effective preventive therapies that can adapt to changes in the life-course from toddlers to school-age children is dependent on accurate risk factor and tooth surface assessment. Thus, the objectives of this innovative continuation renewal study are: 1) to develop a practical and easily-scored caries risk tool for use in primary medical healthcare settings to identify high caries risk children, expanding from the toddler (1-4) to the school-age years (5-8); and 2) to determine the relationships between caries risk profiles and caries disease patterns (e.g., occlusal vs. proximal) in the mixed dentition. This will be accomplished by following a cohort of 876 primary caregiver (PCG)-child pairs from our ongoing U01's enrolled pairs. This cohort represents a diverse population, including ethnic/racial minorities and low SES groups. The PCG will complete a caries risk questionnaire and the child will have caries examinations at baseline (child's age 5.5 years old + 3 months), and again at 18 months (child's age 7 years + 3 months) and 36 months after baseline (child's age 8.5 years + 3 months) to monitor the caries disease process. Longitudinal caries risk data and caries disease prevalence/incidence and tooth surface pattern information collected from age 1-4 (ongoing U01) and 5-8 (proposed continuing renewal) will be used to assess risk of caries in children ages 5-8. A great strength of this proposal is that it involves four experienced medical and dental investigator groups, who have successfully worked together for the past 5.5 years and can facilitate follow-up of the study cohort. The significance is that identification of high caries risk children in primary healthcare settings will allow cost- effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed, targeted and used in interprofessional settings to prevent caries development from the toddler to the school-age years. This will have immediate broad impact and influence on existing and/or new policies and programs to be delivered by non-dental professionals in medical settings and other non- healthcare settings (e.g., school-based), as well as by dental professionals in dental healthcare settings. Relevance:  The relevance of this collaborative, innovative and high impact project (continuing renewal of our ongoing caries risk study U01-DE021412-06) is that it will result in a valid, reliable, and practical (easy to score) caries risk assessment tool for the identification of high caries risk children, expanding from the toddler to the school-age years, in primary medical healthcare and other non-dental settings (e.g., could be used at the required physical before entering public schools, etc.). When information collected from age 5-8 is combined with data from our ongoing U01 grant (ages 1-4), it will enhance understanding of life-course caries risk changes and changing patterns of carious tooth surfaces (e.g., occlusal vs. proximal) in children from age 1-8, allowing for cost-effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed and targeted to prevent caries. This proposal is responsive to NIDCR's Strategic Plan Goal 2.2 [Engage primary care providers and health specialists toward individualized, evidence-based health assessment, disease prevention, and treatments] and Goal 3 [Apply rigorous, multidisciplinary research approaches to overcome disparities in dental, oral, and craniofacial health].","Predicting Caries Risk in Underserved Children, from

"Obesity and Caries in Young South Asian Children: A Common Risk Factor Approach ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Asians are the fastest growing immigrant community in the United States and experience high rates of health disparities. South Asian children are at high risk for the two most common diseases of early childhood: caries and obesity. This application uses the Common Risk/Health Factor Approach (CR/HFA) to target risk factors for childhood caries and obesity. Our study, CHALO! (""Child Health Action to Lower Oral Health and Obesity Risk"") comes from the Hindi word that means ""Let's go!"". CHALO is a multi-level intervention (see figure) that includes a randomized controlled trial of a home visit intervention, and a Knowledge Translation campaign. The primary focus is behavioral change in bottle/'sippy' cup use and dietary intake-- factors that are common to both caries and obesity. Unique cariogenic and obesogenic behaviors are also targeted. Secondary outcomes include caries incidence and growth. Research assessments when children are 6 (baseline), 12, and 18 months of age will include novel techniques for assessing feeding practices (i.e., iPad assisted 24 hour dietary recall) and caries presence and severity (i.e., intra-oral cameras) that were developed by our team. CHALO will be conducted in the metro NY/NJ area, home to a large low-income high risk South Asian community. An RCT (Aim 1) will enroll 377 mothers of children 4-6 months old from New York City (n=3) and New Jersey (n=2) pediatric practices in our primary care research network SAPPHIRE (""SA Practice Partnership for Health Improvement and Research""). The intervention includes: a) home visits with mothers/families (n=6 visits over one year) and follow up phone support; b) patient navigation to make/keep timely dental visits (2x by 18 months). The Knowledge Translation component (Aim 2) will raise awareness of child health risks in South Asian communities and among professionals who provide their care. The campaign will include both traditional and social media components and will be evaluated using multiple metrics. Our multi-disciplinary team has expertise in cross-cultural psychology, clinical trials, child nutrition, health education and caries. CHALO builds upon the team's prior and on-going funded trials of caries and obesity interventions in young children. Innovations include: use of CR/HFA to target twin child health disparities; under-studied South Asian immigrant sample; intervention at multiple levels of the Social-Ecological model; cutting edge measurement technologies; and social marketing and evaluation. If successful, the CR/HFA offers an efficient and potentially cost-effective means of improving child health in at-risk populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study employs a Common Risk/Health Factors Approach (CR/HFA) to the 2 most common health disparities of early childhood -dental caries and obesity-- in the nation's fast growing low-income South Asian immigrant community. It includes: a) an RCT- aimed at reducing feeding practices that increase caries and obesity risks (e.g., use of bottle/'sippy' cups) and increasing health-promoting behaviors (activity, dental visit) in young children, and b) a Knowledge Translation campaign to raise awareness among families, communities, and dental and pediatric providers. This study represents the first application of the CR/HFA in the nation, and only the second RCT of this efficient and potentially cost-effective approach worldwide.",Obesity and Caries in Young South Asian Children: A Common Risk Factor Approach,9614807,R01MD010460,"['Anxiety ', ' Awareness ', ' Bangladesh ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' pediatric nutrition ', ' Child Nutrition ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' Control Groups ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Family ', ' Feeding Patterns ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Incidence ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Methods ', ' Milk ', ' Modernization ', ' Mothers ', ' New Jersey ', ' New York City ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Pakistan ', ' Partnership Practice ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Marketing ', ' Sweeteners ', ' Sweetening Agents ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Time ', ' tooth brushing ', ' Toothbrushing ', ' Twins ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Dental ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' tool ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Napping ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Juice ', ' Dietary intake ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Length ', ' Age-Months ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' South Asian ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' obesity in children ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' child obesity ', ' child adiposity ', ' Home visitation ', ' home visit ', ' House Call ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' tv watching ', ' television watching ', ' screen time ', ' feeding ', ' cost effective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk of obesity ', ' risk for obesity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' knowledge translation ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' secondary outcome ', ' obesogenic ', ' obesigenic ', ' social media ', ' Child Health ', ' ']",NIMHD,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,775424,0.11087885270837702
"Interactive Parent-targeted Text Messaging in Pediatric Clinics to Reduce ECC ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to RFA-DE-15-006 ""Multidisciplinary and Collaborative Research Consortium to Reduce Oral Health Disparities in Children: A Multi-level Approach."" The prevalence of Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is increasing, disproportionately affecting racial and ethnic minorities (Dye, 2007). Prevention efforts for high risk groups require multi-level strategies. We will target parents/legal guardians of children (<6 years) during pediatric well-child visits at urban community health centers (CHCs), and provide a text-message based ECC prevention intervention. We will also target the pediatric providers in the CHCs to adopt oral health guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and also improve documentation within their Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Thus, our multi-level intervention includes children, parents, providers and the CHC system. 85% of adults use text messaging, with no disparities by race/ethnicity, education or income. The benefits of text message interventions include the use anywhere/anytime, low cost, scalability to large populations, ability to tailor message content and intensity, and provision of strategies in real time. CHCs are an ideal venue for oral health promotion both at an individual level (they provide care to the groups at highest risk for ECC) and at a population level (there are 90 CHCs electronically linked locally and >1,100 CHCs nationally). In Phase 1 (UH2), we will conduct focus groups and interviews with parents and CHC providers to inform the development of the oral health text message intervention, as well as assess CHC work flow to identify sustainable strategies for oral health integration and eventual dissemination. This formative work is vital to ensure cultural and environmental compatibility, as we have done previously. The text messages will be consistent with AAP guidelines, our theoretical model (Social Cognitive Theory), and our previous work. We will use the Fisher-Owens Model (2007) as an intervention planning framework. In Phase 2 (UH3), 850 parents/legal guardians of children <6 years attending our target CHCs will be randomized to receive one of two dose-equivalent text message interventions: Oral Health Texts (OHT) or Child Wellness Texts (CWT). The primary outcome variable will be ECC incidence at 24 months. We will assess mediators and moderators of the intervention effect, perform a budget impact analysis to determine the financial consequences of adoption, diffusion, and sustainability of the OHT intervention at CHCs, assess CHC changes in oral health promotion (provider practices and EHR documentation), and assess changes in both pediatric and parent oral health behaviors. This research has strong potential to be an evidence based program that could easily be adopted at low cost and low provider burden in the 1,128 CHCs in the U.S. that treat almost 4.5 million high risk children <6 years old. Our text message intervention is innovative because involves system-generated real time support, tailoring, feedback, and interactivity. Our study has theoretical significance because it integrates a testable theory with an intervention planning model to elucidate mechanisms of change at multiple levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Despite the fact that early childhood caries (ECC) is preventable, it is the most common chronic childhood disease in the US, affecting 28% of those aged 2-5, and disproportionately affecting poor and minority groups. We propose an interactive text messaging intervention delivered to parents of children younger than 6 years old, which aims to foster healthy parent behaviors and reduce ECC in their children. This novel, low cost approach has the potential to expand the ability of community health center (CHC) pediatric clinics to efficiently integrate oral health promotion into their practice and could easily be disseminated to the 1200 CHCs in the United States that treat 4.5 million children younger than 6, most of whom are at high risk for ECC.",Interactive Parent-targeted Text Messaging in Pediatric Clinics to Reduce ECC,9749073,UH3DE025492,"['Academy ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Budgets ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Feedback ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Fluorides ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health behavior ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' Legal Guardians ', ' Lip ', ' Lip structure ', ' literacy ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Parents ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Testing ', ' fabric ', ' Textiles ', ' Time ', ' tooth brushing ', ' Toothbrushing ', ' Toothpaste ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Lifting ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Oral ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 6 year old ', ' six years of age ', ' six year old ', ' age 6 years ', ' 6 years of age ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Evidence based program ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tailored messaging ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Cultural Sensitivity ', ' racial minority ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' income disparities ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' texting ', ' short message service ', ' intervention cost ', ' ']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,UH3,2019,1388431,0.24642982468932573
"Learning about Early Childhood Caries Prevention in a Latino Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed K99/R00 career development award application will support academic preparation and the initiation of an independent research career focused on multilevel factors associated with oral health using a strengths-based approach to reduce pediatric oral health disparities. The oral health of a child cannot be separated from family, community and the environment; thus it is vital to include a multilevel perspective in any comprehensive model of children's oral health. My research in the K99 phase will describe the maternal psychosocial and behavioral factors associated with ECC and also will describe the prevalence of dental caries in a sample of Latino children. Measures taken from the Basic Research Factors Questionnaire (BRFQ) will be used to describe psychosocial and behavioral factors (e.g., oral health locus of control, health beliefs, self- efficacy, Sense o Coherence, stress, importance of oral health, oral health knowledge and behaviors) in Latina mothers of preschool children in Denver, Colorado. The results of this study will be compared to that of a high-risk American Indian population in which similar measures from the BRFQ were used. During the R00 phase, a mixed methods approach will be used to describe the differences at child, family and community levels for caries-free and caries-active urban dwelling Latino children. This methodology will capture the factors measured by the BRFQ survey and then will use qualitative methods to further probe characteristics at each level. I will use asset mapping, which is one on the strengths-based approaches, to describe the protective health assets that enhance the ability of individuals, families, communities and social systems to maintain and sustain oral health and to help reduce oral health inequities in high risk and vulnerable groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research and training has three-fold relevance for public health. First, the award will promote to mentor and nurture a new investigator, who has a background in dentistry and public health and is committed to reducing oral health disparities in the United States. Second, this project will use a multidisciplinary and multi-method approach to describe the protective factors against early childhood caries in Latino children at individual, family and community level. Through this research we will be able to understand why some children, despite being at high risk for developing dental caries, remain caries-free. This will not only add essential and indispensable information to the literature but will guide other investigators in their research. Finally, this research will develop a conceptual outline for behavioral interventions based on the principles of strength based approaches in a community rather than based on pathological model.",Learning about Early Childhood Caries Prevention in a Latino Population,9648144,R00DE024758,"['psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Head Start ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' First Independent Research Support and Transition Awards ', ' FIRST Award ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Behavioral ', ' reservation-based ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Academic support ', ' academic preparation ', ' academic readiness ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' urban dwelling ', ' service delivery ', ' protective factors ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' preschool child (1-5) ', ' 1-5 years old ', ' Preschool Child ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Dentistry ', ' Dentists ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environment and Public Health ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Control Locus ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mothers ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Parents ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Distal ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Distress ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' health knowledge ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R00,2019,244238,0.31909119035797195
"Longitudinal Analysis of Dental Caries Indices in Inner-City African-American Children Project Summary This project addresses the urgent need of a comprehensive model to further our understanding of the complex and dynamic role of various risk factors in early childhood caries (ECC) development across the child's age continuum. Although the risk factors (biological, behavioral, socio-economic, psychological and environmental) of ECC are relatively well known, their effects and their discriminating power along the disease pathological process remain poorly understood. A popular approach for evaluating these effects has been to use models that impose homogeneity along the life course of the disease, or to rely on cross-sectional data. This approach is useful but has limitations. Some risk factors may be more important in very early life (eg., low birth weight and other biological conditions), but less relevant in older ages as other risk factors come into play and the children become more vulnerable to caries. A unique study that provides detailed longitudinal information to untangle the cascade of relevant risk factors along the life course of ECC is the Detroit Dental Health Project. This is a longitudinal study designed to understand the oral health of low-income African-American children (0-5 years) and their main caregivers (14+ years) residing in the city of Detroit, Michigan. Among other information, this study comprises longitudinal investigations involving various risk factors and mouth-level caries indices which can help to delineate the natural trajectories of ECC in an unfortunate setting of limited clinical intervention. Analyzing ECC data from the Detroit study is inherently complex because of the large number of ECC risk factors that are potentially correlated; complex relationships between these risk factors and caries along the child's age continuum; the longitudinal (within-child) association of caries indices; and a sizeable frequency of zero-valued caries indices. To our best knowledge, we are not aware of any statistical method that addresses these nontrivial complications that are very specific to ECC indices and the Detroit data. We propose to fill this gap in the literature by formulating a less restrictive semiparametric model coupled with a variable selection method to understand the life course of ECC among inner-city African-American children. Formulating and implementing such a model is not trivial owing to the complexity of the theoretical arguments and the computational burden. Following the completion of this project, we will acquire evidenced-based knowledge that would be helpful in tailoring a dental caries prevention policy for low-income children during the first five years of life. Project Narrative The proposed research will formulate a less restrictive semiparametric model to further our understanding of the life course of early childhood dental caries in relation to important risk factors. The success of the project will advance our knowledge of early childhood caries in low-income African-American children, and help policy makers formulate prevention recommendations targeted for specific subgroups of this population, which ultimately will eliminate intra-group oral health disparities.",Longitudinal Analysis of Dental Caries Indices in Inner-City African-American Children,9668797,R03DE027108,"['Afro American ', ' African American ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' tooth surface ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' early childhood ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Caries prevention ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' evidence base ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' screening ', ' Formulation ', ' semiparametric ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' DMF Indexe ', ' DMF Index ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Literature ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' tooth brushing ', ' Toothbrushing ', ' Deciduous Dentition ', ' Primary Dentition ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' ']",NIDCR,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,149426,0.18603515469927953
"Developing an Oral Health Behavior Social Support Scale for Mexican-origin Adults Project Summary Nationwide, Mexican-American adults over age 30 have the highest prevalence of periodontal disease of all racial/ethnic groups (67% vs. 43% fornon-Hispanic Whites)(Eke, Dye et al. 2015). Poor oral hygiene is one risk factor for this common, preventable disease. However, few interventions focus on improving oral hygiene in this high-risk group, many of whom are also low-income and lack access to dental care. Social support has been targeted successfully in social and behavioral interventions to improve dietary behaviors, physical activity, and chronic disease management among Mexican-origin adults, but it has not been studied extensively in an oral health context. In addition, the role of social support differs for men and women with other health behaviors, supporting the need to study differences between men and women. This study addresses these gaps by developing a bilingual (English/Spanish) oral health behavior-specific social support scale for use in future intervention research. Developing such a measure will enable more precise assessment of the role and perceived impact of different sources and types of social support on daily hygiene behavior, dental care utilization, and oral health outcomes. Our experienced, multi-disciplinary team proposes a two-phase mixed methods study that will: 1) qualitatively explore the relevant social influences on oral health behavior for lower income Mexican-origin young adult men and women to understand structural and functional aspects of social support; 2) develop and pilot test an oral health behavior-specific social support scale, and 3) quantitatively assess the scale’s psychometric properties and association with oral health status and behavior. Phase I proposes semi-structured interviews with 25-40 men and 25-40 women from the target population of Mexican- origin young adults, to explore dimensions of social support in an oral health context as part of scale item generation and refinement. Cognitive interviews will be conducted to assess scale content and understanding of item and response option wording and order of the draft scale with 40 different adults from the target population, before it is piloted with 200 adults. Phase II will quantitatively validate the scale. Surveys will be conducted with 500 men and women, and a subset of >250 will also receive a dental exam. Phase II analysis will include cluster and factor analysis of the new social support scale, calculate the Cronbach’s alpha to assess internal consistency, and assess scale and subscale validity (content, face, construct, concurrent, divergent, and discriminant validity) and reliability. Sex-stratified analyses will examine associations with self-reported oral hygiene behavior (brushing, flossing, rinsing), dental care utilization, multiple self-rated oral health status indices, and clinically-assessed oral health status (tooth loss; caries; periodontal disease). This study will yield a culturally-sensitive social support scale that will advance understanding of potential pathways through which social relationships affect oral health behavior and outcomes for young adults of Mexican-origin, at high risk for oral disease, findings important for future theory-informed, evidence-based randomized controlled trials. Public Health Relevance This study will develop and validate a culturally-relevant, behavior-specific social support scale that will advance understanding of pathways among oral hygiene behaviors (brushing, flossing, rinsing), dental care utilization, and oral health status among young Mexican-origin adults at high risk for oral disease.

"Health Reform and Oral Health Disparities: a Mixed Methods Evaluation Project Summary/Abstract Despite numerous efforts to increase access to dental care for vulnerable groups, disparities in oral health and healthcare continue to exist. Medicaid is now the nation's largest source of health insurance coverage, and since it primarily offers insurance to low-income and disabled individuals, Medicaid is a key policy lever for addressing socioeconomic disparities in health care. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded Medicaid to millions of previously ineligible adults, but only 31 states and Washington DC, have chosen to participate thus far. The goal of this proposal is to leverage the natural experiment created by ACA implementation and take advantage of state-level variation in the extent of dental care covered by Medicaid in order to assess the impact of these policies to date on oral health inequalities. As Congress continues to consider major changes to Medicaid and the ACA, the results of our analysis can offer important insights for the future of oral health inequalities. We propose a mixed-methods study, combining a quantitative component using a quasi-experimental study design and national public datasets, and a qualitative element using primary data collection to assess the impact of the ACA Medicaid expansion on oral health. This project includes four studies; during the K99 phase we propose to address the following aims: 1) To estimate the effect of Medicaid expansion under the ACA on access to and utilization of oral health services; and 2) To measure the impact of Medicaid expansion on individuals' oral health- related behaviors and race/ethnic and socioeconomic inequalities in untreated dental disease. We will then address the R00 phase through the following aims: 3) To better understand dental providers' perceptions of, attitudes toward, and experiences with Medicaid expansion and to explore ACA implementation challenges; and 4) To identify barriers to and facilitators of accessing oral health care after ACA expansion among Medicaid beneficiaries. By triangulating the views from both Medicaid providers and beneficiaries, we believe our approach will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the barriers and facilitators to ACA implementation. Findings from this study will enhance our understanding of barriers to access to oral health care that could inform future policies and interventions. Furthermore, it will aid in assessing national progress towards reducing socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in access to oral health services and explore mechanisms by which health policy could impact disparities in oral health. This career development award will provide me with protected research time and thus the opportunity to expand my research skills and knowledge. I will pursue further training in health policy, econometrics and mixed-methods research through didactic courses and formal advising from my mentors, who are experts in public health, health policy, health economics, health disparities, and qualitative methods. The setting of this award is at Harvard School of Dental Medicine and Harvard School of Public Health. This rich research environment will support my development as an independent researcher. Project Narrative Cost-related barriers to dental care are a major contributor to oral health inequalities. This study will examine the impact of health policy, the Affordable Care Act coverage expansion, on access to and utilization of dental services in the United States. Findings from this project will provide evidence to assess national progress towards reducing disparities in oral health and inform future policy development to improve access to dental care and reduce inequalities in oral health.",Health Reform and Oral Health Disparities: a Mixed Methods Evaluation,9783885,K99MD012253,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' meeting reports ', ' Congresses ', ' Data Collection ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dentists ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Relationship of Parental Health Literacy with Change Over Time in Oral Health Outcomes Among American Indian Children Project Summary  “Health literacy” (HL) refers to “the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.” Among American Indians and Alaska Natives, 48% of adults have limited HL. This high rate of limitations is concerning given that restricted HL is related to poor health-related knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and outcomes. Although it is clear that HL limitations among parents are related to suboptimal outcomes in children, few studies have examined the link between parental HL (PHL) and children's oral health. Further, because prior studies have used cross-sectional data, it is unclear whether PHL is related to change over time in children's oral health. The objective of the project is to investigate the association of PHL with change over time in pediatric oral health outcomes and to clarify the mechanisms that explain the PHL-outcomes relationship. The role of PHL will be explored in a sample of American Indians, a population at risk for poor oral health. Indeed, by age 5, 75% of Native children have dental decay. Using secondary data from the NIDCR-funded project “Promoting Behavioral Change for Oral Health in American Indian Mothers and Children” (PBC; U54DE019259), the research team will use advanced analytic techniques to test a theoretical framework designed to clarify the mechanisms through which PHL is linked to pediatric oral health outcomes. The mediating roles of parental oral health knowledge, attitudes, and behavior will be examined. The PBC project is a randomized controlled trial designed to test the impact of a motivational interviewing intervention on parental oral health knowledge, attitudes, behavior, and pediatric oral health outcomes. The analysis sample will include 575 parent-child dyads recruited when the child was a newborn and followed for 3 years. The specific aims of the study are the following: (1) Using baseline data, assess the relationship of PHL with parental oral health knowledge, attitudes, and behavior; (2) Using longitudinal data, determine the relationship of baseline PHL with change over time in parental oral health knowledge, attitudes, and behavior, and with pediatric oral health outcomes; and (3) Determine whether the proposed theoretical framework accurately explains the relationships among baseline PHL; parental oral health knowledge, attitudes, and behavior; and pediatric oral health outcomes. The proposed project will be the first to examine the association of PHL with change over time in children's oral health outcomes and to clarify the mechanisms that explain that relationship. As testing of a comprehensive conceptual model of PHL has not been conducted, the study's results will advance science related to PHL and inform development of effective oral health interventions for American Indians and other high-risk populations. In addition, this work will provide a critical evaluation of the role PHL plays in the oral health of Native communities, a population at risk for limited PHL and poor pediatric oral health outcomes. The project addresses NIDCR's aims to overcome disparities in oral health and to examine risk factors and mechanisms of behavior change in oral health. Project Narrative  The term “health literacy” refers to the ability to understand and use health-related information. This project will clarify how parental health literacy is associated with change over time in oral health outcomes among American Indian children. Findings from this work will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms through which parental health literacy is linked to outcomes and will inform the development of interventions that will be effective for parents with limited health literacy skills.",Relationship of Parental Health Literacy with Change Over Time in Oral Health Outcomes Among American Indian Children,9741131,R01DE027077,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Attitude ', ' Attitude to Health ', ' health attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Fluorides ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' newborn children ', ' newborn child ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' Information Services ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' Mothers ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' South Dakota ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' insight ', ' sugar ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' health knowledge ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' skills ', ' parental role ', ' parent role ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' literate ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Age-Months ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' health literacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Pine Ridge Indian Reservation ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' group intervention ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' trial design ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2019,295076,0.2642671032840372
"Multi-Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in Primary Care Settings ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Northeast Ohio has one of the highest rates of untreated cavities among poor and minority <6 yr old children. While the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommend adoption of oral health assessment within the primary care setting for children up to 6 yrs old, the evidence for such activities have been poor or lacking. Primary care clinicians can play an important role in communicating oral health (OH) facts to parent/caregivers at well-child visits (WCV) to reduce disparities in dental care access. Childhood caries is multifactorial in origin, but evidence suggests that innovative theory-driven interventions have not targeted determinants at the child-parent, provider (physician), practice/organization levels. The intervention mapping framework was used to develop the multi-level interventions: Parent: improve perception and skills - a common-sense model of self-regulation (CSM)-based OH facts letter + dental information guide (DIG); Provider (Physician): improve knowledge and skills -CSM-based education and skills, communicate OH facts, provide prescription to go to dentist; Practice (Pediatric): quality improvement -integrate systematic EMR documentation of OH, practice-tailored facilitation. A cluster-randomized clinical trial with a hybrid design is proposed to test behavioral (parent, provider) and implementation (practice) intervention to increase dental attendance among low-income children. Twenty pediatric practices will be utilized for the following primary aims: 1) UH2, Conduct formative work through community engagement and pilot-testing of the interventions and protocols in 2 practices; UH3, randomize 18 practices to four arms to investigate: 2) effect of bundled (parent + provider + practice level) interventions vs. enhanced usual care; 3) effect of behavioral and implementation components of the intervention. Secondary aims (UH3) are: assess effectiveness of interventions on secondary outcomes (new decay, oral hygiene, OHRQL, frequency of sweet snacks and beverages, cost); assess potential mediators and moderators to investigate pathways; assess adoption, reach, fidelity, maintenance measures. The sample includes 88 providers and 1584 parent/caregivers (of Medicaid- enrolled 3-6 year old children). Data analysis (UH2) will utilize a mixed method design for qualitative and descriptive/analytical statistics for quantitative data resulting from focus groups, interviews, and pilot-testing. Data collection (UH3) will follow the RE-AIM framework: child (primary, secondary outcomes from dental screening/Medicaid claims); parent, provider, practice (mediators, moderators from questionnaires); provider, practice (fidelity and implementation measures from audits). Generalized linear mixed effects models will assess effects of multi-level interventions on dental attendance and other outcomes, while accounting for clustering within family, provider and practice. Secondarily, mediation methods, accompanied by sensitivity analyses, will determine if intervention effects occur through hypothesized mediators. A comprehensive and innovative scalable oral health care model is proposed for widespread use by front-line primary care clinicians. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will test innovative theory-driven multi-level interventions at the parent/caregiver, provider (physician), practice (pediatric) levels to increas dental attendance and reduce untreated caries among 3 to 6 year old Medicaid-enrolled children attending well-child visits in the pediatrician's offices. The behavioral interventions at the parent and provider levels, and implementation strategies at the practice level will help parent to seek dental care for child. These novel interventions have the potential for a new oral health care model for physicians providing care for young children.",Multi-Level Interventions to Reduce Caries Disparities in Primary Care

"CenteringPregnancy Oral Health Promotion (CPOP) Clinical Trial Abstract Federal agencies and professional organizations have mounted a large effort to address an increasingly recognized public health problem – poor perinatal oral health – which has serious implications for maternal and child health and is largely preventable. Several national organizations have issued statements prioritizing the need to improve oral health and access to oral health care during pregnancy and the National Maternal and Child Health Bureau has released consensus statements and clinical guidelines on perinatal oral health care during pregnancy. The provision of the recommended oral health care during pregnancy has the potential to improve women's oral health through improved prevention and restorative care and to promote children's oral health through caregiver education and timely anticipatory guidance. Through funding from the NIDCR (R21DE019211 Adams, PI; U54 DE019285 Chung, PI), we developed and pilot tested the CenteringPregnancy Oral Health Promotion (“CPOP”) Intervention, an oral health intervention for pregnant women attending CenteringPregnancy® (CP), a group prenatal care program. The CPOP intervention consists of 2 educational and skills building modules (maternal and infant) that are integrated into the CP curriculum, and delivered by trained CP facilitators. To evaluate the modules, the women completed dental examinations and questionnaires assessments of OH knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors at pre- and post- intervention periods. Infant and maternal salivary bacterial levels were assessed when the infants were 6 and 12 months of age. Findings from the CPOP pilot studies show significant improvements in maternal and infant clinically-assessed oral health. NIDCR funding (R34DE024574) has supported the development of the final planning and preparation for the U01 CPOP RCT. The purpose of this U01 proposal is to test the efficacy of the CPOP intervention as a full scale Phase III randomized controlled trial among a group of women receiving CP prenatal care at sites across Northern California. If shown to be efficacious, CPOP could be implemented rapidly and broadly nationwide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although dental care during pregnancy including preventive and restorative care and anticipatory guidance regarding optimal infant oral health is important, most women do not receive dental care during pregnancy. However, most women do access prenatal care, and there are many aspects of dental care that can be delivered in non-dental settings such as prenatal care including oral health education, hygiene instruction and anticipatory guidance for infant oral health. If the CenteringPregnancy® Oral Health Promotion (CPOP) intervention was determined to be efficacious within a U01 clinical trial, it could be disseminated widely into CenteringPregnancy® (CP) group prenatal care programs nationwide, and potentially in other group care models, having a significant positive influence on oral health of women and children broadly.",CenteringPregnancy Oral Health Promotion (CPOP) Clinical Trial,9762887,U01DE027340,"['Attitude ', ' Attitude to Health ', ' health attitude ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Bacteria ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Hygiene ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Lactobacillus ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mothers ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' prenatal visit ', ' prenatal checkup ', ' prenatal appointment ', ' pregnancy care ', ' Prenatal care ', ' professional society ', ' professional membership ', ' professional association ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' S.mutans ', ' S. mutans ', ' S mutans ', ' Streptococcus mutans ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' post-partum ', ' Postpartum ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Perinatal ', ' Peripartum ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Fostering ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Letters ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Salivary ', ' health knowledge ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' skills ', ' empowerment ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Age-Months ', ' caregiver education ', ' caregiver training ', ' care giver training ', ' care giver instruction ', ' care giver education ', ' Caregiver instruction ', ' Maternal and Child Health ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ', ' ACOG ', ' Preparation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' post intervention ', ' Instruction ', ' oral streptococci ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' prenatal health ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' evidence base ', ' standard of care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' efficacy testing ', ' hands-on learning ', ' interactive learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' applied learning ', ' community building ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' Child Health ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' ']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U01,2019,1230419,0.2803680329082957
"Howard University Summer Research Experience Program in Oral Health Disparity for Underrepresented Racial and Ethnic Students ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How Racial disparity in oral health has been well documented for several decades. However, the disparity persists, particularly between African Americans and other ethnic groups, despite advances in diagnosis and treatment. Increasing diversity in oral health research and care workforce is an effective strategy to improve the Nation's capacity to address and eliminate oral health disparities. In this project, we propose a full-time eight-week summer research experience program (SREP) at Howard University, aiming at engaging, recruiting and training undergraduate students from underrepresented minority and other disparity populations into minority health care and oral health disparity research. This SREP is designed to be a specialized didactic and mentored academic program with a series of formal and informal research and education activities tailored for recruiting and training undergraduate students.  To provide effective mentoring for the students, we will: 1) develop a highly networked team of motivated and skilled mentors from various disciplines through the strong partnership between Howard and Johns Hopkins Universities; and 2) develop an effective and sustainable research training and education infrastructure by establishing a 3-tiered Mentoring System, Committees of Execution and Advising, and an Evaluation Core. The 3-tiered Mentoring System is specifically designed for mentoring each participating undergraduate by a primary mentor with basic, translational or public research focus at Howard, a secondary senior mentor at Johns Hopkins and other institutes, and a career development advisory mentor from oral health professionals.  The SREP is also designed to be an extension for two existing training programs at Howard University College of Dentistry: the NIH funded P20 program for training dental school students and faculty, and the HRSA funded Post-doctoral Training Program in Pediatric Dentistry (PTPD). Different from the two programs, the proposed SREP emphasizes on providing research experience for underrepresented undergraduates in oral health disparity. This program, combined with the P20 and PTPD programs, will bring together Howard students from diverse backgrounds and interests to create a rich mix of participants from across disciplinary backgrounds.  Through the SREP, we will be able to provide summer research training for five highly qualified students every year over the 5-year funding period (a total of 25 students). By participating in multi-disciplinary research projects and education events of senior investigators who will serve as mentors and role models, the students will gain valuable research experience and knowledge in oral health, and promote them into advanced education in oral health. Successful completion of this program will have significantly impacted the dental, oral and craniofacial research and training environment at Howard University College of Dentistry.

"Predicting Caries Risk in Underserved Children, from Toddlers to the School-Age Years, in Primary Healthcare Settings Project Summary/Abstract: Dental caries, one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood, is a largely preventable disease, yet approximately 23% of U.S. children 2-5 years-of-age experience dental caries, and this number more than doubles to 56% among those aged 6-8. In the current environment of escalating healthcare costs and resource constraints, the large disparities in caries experience and access to care that exist in the U.S., especially among low socioeconomic status (SES) and minority population groups, call for a greater focus on targeted (at the patient and tooth surface level), risk-based caries preventive and therapeutic strategies to be delivered through interprofessional partnerships, including primary healthcare settings. Our team has just finished following 1,326 children from age 1 to age 4, and we have started data analyses to validate a caries risk questionnaire for use by medical providers to accurately identify high caries risk toddlers. The problem is that, while caries experience more than doubles from ages 2-5 to 6-8, caries in primary teeth during mixed dentition is a largely neglected area of research and prevention, there is no validated caries risk tool for medical settings to easily help triage 5- 8 year old children, and there have been almost no studies following the life-course progression of caries in children 1-8. This information is critically important, as designing and targeting efficacious and cost-effective preventive therapies that can adapt to changes in the life-course from toddlers to school-age children is dependent on accurate risk factor and tooth surface assessment. Thus, the objectives of this innovative continuation renewal study are: 1) to develop a practical and easily-scored caries risk tool for use in primary medical healthcare settings to identify high caries risk children, expanding from the toddler (1-4) to the school-age years (5-8); and 2) to determine the relationships between caries risk profiles and caries disease patterns (e.g., occlusal vs. proximal) in the mixed dentition. This will be accomplished by following a cohort of 876 primary caregiver (PCG)-child pairs from our ongoing U01's enrolled pairs. This cohort represents a diverse population, including ethnic/racial minorities and low SES groups. The PCG will complete a caries risk questionnaire and the child will have caries examinations at baseline (child's age 5.5 years old + 3 months), and again at 18 months (child's age 7 years + 3 months) and 36 months after baseline (child's age 8.5 years + 3 months) to monitor the caries disease process. Longitudinal caries risk data and caries disease prevalence/incidence and tooth surface pattern information collected from age 1-4 (ongoing U01) and 5-8 (proposed continuing renewal) will be used to assess risk of caries in children ages 5-8. A great strength of this proposal is that it involves four experienced medical and dental investigator groups, who have successfully worked together for the past 5.5 years and can facilitate follow-up of the study cohort. The significance is that identification of high caries risk children in primary healthcare settings will allow cost- effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed, targeted and used in interprofessional settings to prevent caries development from the toddler to the school-age years. This will have immediate broad impact and influence on existing and/or new policies and programs to be delivered by non-dental professionals in medical settings and other non- healthcare settings (e.g., school-based), as well as by dental professionals in dental healthcare settings. Relevance:  The relevance of this collaborative, innovative and high impact project (continuing renewal of our ongoing caries risk study U01-DE021412-06) is that it will result in a valid, reliable, and practical (easy to score) caries risk assessment tool for the identification of high caries risk children, expanding from the toddler to the school-age years, in primary medical healthcare and other non-dental settings (e.g., could be used at the required physical before entering public schools, etc.). When information collected from age 5-8 is combined with data from our ongoing U01 grant (ages 1-4), it will enhance understanding of life-course caries risk changes and changing patterns of carious tooth surfaces (e.g., occlusal vs. proximal) in children from age 1-8, allowing for cost-effective preventive and/or referral strategies to be developed and targeted to prevent caries. This proposal is responsive to NIDCR's Strategic Plan Goal 2.2 [Engage primary care providers and health specialists toward individualized, evidence-based health assessment, disease prevention, and treatments] and Goal 3 [Apply rigorous, multidisciplinary research approaches to overcome disparities in dental, oral, and craniofacial health].","Predicting Caries Risk in Underserved Children, from

"Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia ABSTRACT  Oral disease, in particular childhood caries, remains a major health burden which affects some communities disproportionally, including regions of Appalachia. Both increased sugar intake and frequency of exposure alter the oral microbial community, triggering a disease process that leads to caries. Additional factors associated with caries in children include genetic risk, household SES, maternal caregiving behavior and stress, access to care. Progress has been made in understanding many of these factors. However, much remains to be done in order to further characterize individual risk factors, but just as importantly, to determine how interactions between them lead to oral health disparities.  The current proposal is a renewal of our ongoing project (R01-DE-014899) to identify factors contributing to the oral health disparity seen in northern Appalachia. The guiding philosophy of our project (the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia; COHRA) has been and continues to be that developing strategies to address this disparity requires simultaneous study of multiple risk components (ideally within families) to determine their roles, interactions among them, and their transmissibility patterns. COHRA's long- term goal remains to determine the sources of oral health disparity in a high risk, Northern Appalachian population so that effective preventive interventions can be designed and targeted.  During the previous project period that began Sept 1, 2009, we recruited a cohort of approximately 1000 northern Appalachian women during pregnancy (COHRA2), following them and their children through their children's second birthday. This prospective study of mother-child pairs complements the original cohort of approximately 840 northern Appalachian families (COHRA1) by gathering multifaceted, longitudinal data on the earliest antecedents of caries formation. As detailed in the progress report, the specific aims of the previous project period (using both COHRA1 and COHRA2 cohorts) were all accomplished (recruitment targets, genetic analyses of the COHRA1 cohort, psychosocial investigations, microbial assessments). We propose to follow the current COHRA2 cohort as it grows from ages 2 to 6, and to use the resulting longitudinal demographic, medical, diet, and psychosocial data to test hypotheses about the causal relationships between risk factors contributing to the unusually high rates of caries formation in this population. We will integrate the additional data to be collected with existing and new genetic and microbial data to identify “cariogenic profiles,” in which the interactions between mother and child genetics, oral ecology, diet, and other environmental/psychosocial behaviors in infancy and early childhood are combined to predict unusually high risks for onset of caries before age 6. NARRATIVE Oral disease, in particular childhood caries, remains a major health burden which affects some communities disproportionally, including regions of Appalachia. The goal of the requested competing continuation remains to determine the factors leading to oral health disparity in children followed up to age 6 from a high risk, Northern Appalachian population.",Factors Contributing to Oral Health Disparities in Appalachia,9967824,R01DE014899,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian ', ' Behavior ', ' Beverages ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Dental caries ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Decay ', ' tooth decay ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Household ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mining ', ' Mothers ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Phenotype ', ' Philosophy ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Tooth ', ' teeth ', ' Woman ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Natural History ', ' Medical ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Oral ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Viral ', ' psychosocial ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' stressed mothers ', ' maternal stress ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' early onset ', ' anti-microbial peptide ', ' antimicrobial peptide ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' high risk ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' risk variant ', ' maternal care giving ', ' maternal caregiving ', ' recruit ', ' oral microbiota ', ' oral microflora ', ' oral microbial community ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,4218171,0.27427076199661
"Integrative analysis of the oral microbiome of American Indian Infants and the impact of a childhood obesity-prevention home visiting program on early childhood caries PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Early childhood caries (ECC) has devastating and long-lasting health consequences. These include higher healthcare costs, pain, infection, lower self-esteem, delayed speech development, poor performance in school, and subsequent poor oral and overall health outcomes as adults. The prevalence of ECC in children of American Indian (AI) families is considerably higher compared to all races in the United States, with ECC occurrence as early as one year of age. ECC and the closely related health disparity early childhood obesity (ECO), are critical for young AI children, especially in the Navajo community that has limited access to nutritious food and clean, safe drinking water. Diet is a crucial contributing factor to ECC and ECO, where high dietary sugar intake and early initiation of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) before six months of age contribute significantly to both conditions in Navajo infants. Frequent sugar consumption drives the selection of cariogenic bacteria and associated metabolic activities within the oral microbiota that ultimately results in caries development. Acquisition and proliferation of cariogenic bacteria before two years of age have been associated with an increased risk of caries. However, the development of the oral microbiome and the impact of the sugar intake reduction on the pattern of microbiota in high-risk Navajo infants remain largely unknown.  Recently, an ECO prevention program, called Family Spirit Nurture, was implemented in the Navajo Shiprock community through a randomized controlled trial. The intervention focused on infant feeding practices and SSB intake reduction. The trial enrolled mother-infant dyads and collected longitudinal oral samples from infants aged 3 to 12 months, maternal and child confounding factors, and ECC status at 1 year of age. This trial provided an unparalleled opportunity for the longitudinal investigation of Navajo infants at an early age with two important specific aims: 1) evaluate the developing oral microbiome of Navajo infants in relation to maternal and child confounding factors and the potential impact of the sugar reduction intervention on the oral microbiome profiles and caries outcomes and 2) investigate the metabolome of Navajo infants’ oral microbial communities in correlation with ECC outcomes at 12 months of age.  We hypothesize that 1) the sugar reduction intervention may influence the oral microbiome composition toward non-cariogenic species and reduce ECC outcome at 12 months of age, 2) there would be developmental changes in the oral microbiome of caries-free Navajo infants and pathogenic shifts in the oral microbiome pattern for those infants who eventually develop caries, 3) Microbial communities of the caries- affected group at 12 months of age may have a higher level of carbohydrate metabolism-related metabolites compared to the caries-free group, and 4) there exists caries-related metabolite signatures of Navajo infants. The goal of this study is to evaluate if the oral microbial and metabolic profiles of Navajo infants could be used to predict ECC and to develop a therapeutic intervention through future research plans. PROJECT NARRATIVE High-risk Navajo American Indian infants have one of the highest prevalences of early childhood caries (ECC) and early childhood obesity (ECO) due to the high intake of dietary sugar and the early initiation of sugar- sweetened beverages (SSBs) from the lack of access to nutritious food and clean, safe drinking water. The development of the oral microbiome and the impact of the sugar intake reduction on the pattern of the oral bacteria communities in the high-risk Navajo infants remain largely unknown, and this study takes advantage of the collected oral samples from Navajo infants, enrolled in a longitudinal, randomized, controlled trial of ECO prevention program that delivered education-based SSB reduction intervention to address this knowledge gap.

"Baltimore Oral Epidemiology, Disease Effects, and HIV Evaluation Study (BEEHIVE) Since the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the life expectancy of persons living with HIV (PLWH) has steadily increased in the United States. PLWH are now more likely to develop co-morbid age-related non- communicable diseases (NCDs) than are similarly-aged HIV-uninfected persons, and the morbidity and mortality of NCD and age-related conditions is paramount. The age-adjusted rates of multiple NCDs are higher among PLWH than among persons who are HIV negative. In addition, PLWH experience higher prevalence and severity of oral diseases, particularly related to the periodontium, although the factors that explain these disparities remain unclear. For example, is HIV-related immune suppression or viremia primarily responsible for these differences? Are lifestyle factors and access to dental care important determinants? Is the microbiome signature in PLWH unique and does it change over time? Since 1988, the AIDS Linked to the Intravenous Experience (ALIVE) study has successfully followed a lower-income, predominantly African American population of HIV-infected and at-risk persons with a history of injecting drugs (PWID) in a community-based cohort in Baltimore. Over three decades, ALIVE has characterized risk factors of incident HIV and progression to AIDS or death, described patterns of risk behaviors, identified barriers to optimal HIV care, and provided important insights into the natural and treated course of HIV among PWID. In recent years, ALIVE has transitioned to exploring the impact of aging with HIV, focusing on phenotypes and organ-specific non-communicable diseases (NCD) (e.g., liver, lung, cardiovascular, bone, kidney, neurocognitive and metabolic NCDs). The proposed project leverages the ALIVE platform to focus on the combined effects of HIV and NCDs on oral health at the health care-seeking, clinical, and microbiological levels. The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) determine to what extent HIV status influences access to and utilization of oral health care services; 2) determine to what extent HIV status affects self-reported and clinical oral health status; 3) determine to what extent HIV status influences the progression of periodontitis; and 4) determine to what extent HIV status impacts the periodontitis-associated oral microbiome signature. The first three specific aims include sub-aims that define the extent to which comorbid NCDs act as effect modifiers. For specific aim 4, one sub-aim describes the extent to which HIV influences the oral microbiome and a second sub-aim defines how longitudinal changes in the oral microbiome signature affect periodontitis progression. To achieve these aims, we build upon biannual ALIVE study visits with interview, clinical examination, and biospecimen components, supplemented by medical record review and registry linkages. The key impact of these aims is to illuminate social and individual-level mechanisms, identify modifiable risk factors, and produce novel insights to inform efficient and targeted oral health interventions for PLWH in Baltimore and nationally. People living with HIV are more likely to experience chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease and are more likely to develop oral diseases than people who are HIV negative. There are many possible explanations for these disparities, including lifestyle choices and the way the body responds to HIV infection and treatments. This study will identify which explanations are most relevant so that oral health-related illness and disability for people living with HIV can be reduced in the future.","Baltimore Oral Epidemiology, Disease Effects, and HIV Evaluation Study (BEEHIVE)",9985345,R01DE029643,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Baltimore ', ' bone ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' dental service ', ' Dentists ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Future ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' Immunosuppression ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' immune suppression ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"A mixed methods study of the intersection of oral health, culture, and autism in African American families Project Summary/Abstract This project will address the important yet often neglected component of overall health, oral health. Unfortunately, oral health care disparities persist for children from ethnic minorities, as well as for children with special health care needs, like autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Several known factors (i.e., familial, social, and structural) serve as barriers to oral health for Black/African American children. Although public policies have attempted to address these obstacles, disparities persist. Similarly, many children with disabilities, such as ASD, encounter significant barriers to the receipt of sound oral care. Impairments in communication, sensory sensitivities, uncooperative behaviors, restrictive eating habits, and dental fear and anxiety contribute to diminished oral care. As a result, many children with ASD require the use of sedation or general anesthesia for routine dental procedures. Currently, no studies have examined the intersection of ASD, Black/African American culture, and oral health practices. The proposed project will address this gap by achieving the following set of aims:  1. Identify the oral health knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Black/African American  parents/caregivers of children with and without ASD.  2. Develop a deeper understanding of the barriers, facilitators, familial and cultural factors that inform oral  health practices of Black/African American families with children with ASD.  3. Identify gaps in oral health care for Black/African American children with and without Autism and  propose recommendations for improvements across levels of influence to enhance oral health. Research participants will be 120 (survey) and 8 – 12 (interview) Black/African American parents/caregivers of children aged 4-14 years, with and without ASD. The oral health disparities that exist for Black/African American children with and without disabilities deserve a greater spotlight because of the importance of oral care to overall health, engagement, and function. In order to accomplish these research project aims, I will engage in several selected trainings activities, which will provide me with the skills, tools, and expertise to conduct translational and transformative research. The following are short-term goals for my fellowship training: 1) Develop a deeper understanding of the multiple underpinnings of health disparities; 2) Gain experience and skills in qualitative research and community-based participatory action research; and 3) Develop skills in teaching, grant-writing, designing research studies, data analysis, and disseminating results for transformative change. Project Narrative Oral health care disparities persist for children from ethnic minorities, as well as for children with special health care needs, like autism spectrum disorders (ASD) despite the implementation of public policies which are meant to address the barriers that vulnerable populations encounter. In this project, I will identify the facilitators and barriers that inform oral health practices and examine the intersection of ASD, Black/African American culture, and oral health. I will use this data to develop recommended actions to enable a better understanding of how to address the oral health disparities of Black/African Americans with and without disabilities and lead to the creation of tailored interventions.","A mixed methods study of the intersection of oral health, culture, and autism in African American families",10067413,F31DE030006,"['Americas ', ' General

"Social networks and oral health-related risk behaviors in public housing communities Social influences are important in the causes of oral health disparities and to changing health-related behaviors in disadvantaged populations. Conceptual models of children’s oral health include dynamic social pathways and the key role of caregivers’ knowledge, attitudes and behaviors. There is a critical lack of information about these pathways, particularly how social influences shape knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to oral health.  We propose to conduct a longitudinal sociometric network analysis among residents of public housing to better understand the factors that affect oral health-related risk behaviors. Although network science is relatively new to oral health disparities research, it is a well-established tool in other areas of health research. Understanding the role of social influences on the initiation and progression of oral disease is critical to the development, testing and implementation of effective behavioral interventions.  Our rationale is that by using network science to measure social interactions in a community, we will be able to define social network pathways that influence the risk-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviors that are associated with oral disease. Using knowledge about social influence that is gained from our research, future interventions may be tested and implemented that will prevent and reduce oral disease for those most at risk for oral disease.  Our specific aims are to: (1) Recruit and enroll a community of public housing residents to evaluate the structural properties of their social networks relevant to oral health risk-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviors at baseline and at 9- month intervals over two time points,  (2) Identify and quantify the exogenous and endogenous factors associated with the observed network structures and,  (3) Determine the association between the composition and structure of networks and oral health risk-related knowledge, attitudes and/or behaviors over time.  Public housing residents are a high impact, high-reward population for the study of oral health disparities because they involve spatial clustering of poverty and poor health. This produces a unique social climate and associated stigma for study that is not seen in other disadvantaged communities.  Our research will study network systems that influence social behaviors that are associated with oral disease and health disparities. Findings from our proposed observational study of public housing communities will help to inform the design of interventions that respond to the complex system dynamics of populations affected by health disparities. Oral health disparities, particularly among children, continue to be a pressing problem in the United States. Traditional approaches to the study of oral health disparities have failed to account for the multi-level factors that influence behavior, resulting in partial understanding of why oral health disparities persist and interventions fail to produce meaningful results. This project will use a systems science approach to better understand the factors affecting the oral health of public housing residents.",Social networks and oral health-related risk behaviors in public housing communities,9979639,R01DE027985,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Boston ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Housing ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' interpersonal relationship ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Housing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social Development ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Measurement ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' System ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Diet and Nutrition ', ' NIDCR ', ' NIDR ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Endogenous Factors ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Exogenous Factors ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' high reward ', ' population health ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' recruit ', ' sociometrics ', ' social metrics ', ' social relationships ', ' ']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,772944,0.29708975336503424
"Relationship of Parental Health Literacy with Change Over Time in Oral Health Outcomes Among American Indian Children Project Summary  “Health literacy” (HL) refers to “the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.” Among American Indians and Alaska Natives, 48% of adults have limited HL. This high rate of limitations is concerning given that restricted HL is related to poor health-related knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and outcomes. Although it is clear that HL limitations among parents are related to suboptimal outcomes in children, few studies have examined the link between parental HL (PHL) and children's oral health. Further, because prior studies have used cross-sectional data, it is unclear whether PHL is related to change over time in children's oral health. The objective of the project is to investigate the association of PHL with change over time in pediatric oral health outcomes and to clarify the mechanisms that explain the PHL-outcomes relationship. The role of PHL will be explored in a sample of American Indians, a population at risk for poor oral health. Indeed, by age 5, 75% of Native children have dental decay. Using secondary data from the NIDCR-funded project “Promoting Behavioral Change for Oral Health in American Indian Mothers and Children” (PBC; U54DE019259), the research team will use advanced analytic techniques to test a theoretical framework designed to clarify the mechanisms through which PHL is linked to pediatric oral health outcomes. The mediating roles of parental oral health knowledge, attitudes, and behavior will be examined. The PBC project is a randomized controlled trial designed to test the impact of a motivational interviewing intervention on parental oral health knowledge, attitudes, behavior, and pediatric oral health outcomes. The analysis sample will include 575 parent-child dyads recruited when the child was a newborn and followed for 3 years. The specific aims of the study are the following: (1) Using baseline data, assess the relationship of PHL with parental oral health knowledge, attitudes, and behavior; (2) Using longitudinal data, determine the relationship of baseline PHL with change over time in parental oral health knowledge, attitudes, and behavior, and with pediatric oral health outcomes; and (3) Determine whether the proposed theoretical framework accurately explains the relationships among baseline PHL; parental oral health knowledge, attitudes, and behavior; and pediatric oral health outcomes. The proposed project will be the first to examine the association of PHL with change over time in children's oral health outcomes and to clarify the mechanisms that explain that relationship. As testing of a comprehensive conceptual model of PHL has not been conducted, the study's results will advance science related to PHL and inform development of effective oral health interventions for American Indians and other high-risk populations. In addition, this work will provide a critical evaluation of the role PHL plays in the oral health of Native communities, a population at risk for limited PHL and poor pediatric oral health outcomes. The project addresses NIDCR's aims to overcome disparities in oral health and to examine risk factors and mechanisms of behavior change in oral health. Project Narrative  The term “health literacy” refers to the ability to understand and use health-related information. This project will clarify how parental health literacy is associated with change over time in oral health outcomes among American Indian children. Findings from this work will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms through which parental health literacy is linked to outcomes and will inform the development of interventions that will be effective for parents with limited health literacy skills.",Relationship of Parental Health Literacy with Change Over Time in Oral Health Outcomes Among American Indian Children,9889105,R01DE027077,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Attitude ', ' Attitude to Health ', ' health attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' dental service ', ' Dental caries ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Decay ', ' tooth decay ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Fluorides ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Information Services ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' Mothers ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' South Dakota ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Tooth ', ' teeth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' sugar ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' health knowledge ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' skills ', ' parent role ', ' parental role ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaska Native ', ' literate ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Age-Months ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' NIDCR ', ' NIDR ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Pine Ridge Indian Reservation ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' group intervention ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' trial design ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recruit ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,295003,0.2642671032840372
"Applying Egocentric Social Network Analysis to Bilingual Oral Health Behavior Social Support Scale Validation for Mexican-origin Adults ABSTRACT This Administrative Supplement for Collaborative Science will support a new research partnership (between Dr. Tracy Finlayson in Public Health, and Dr. Lourdes Martinez in Communication) and the addition of social network science applied to an existing bilingual (English/Spanish) Oral Health Behavior Social Support (OHBSS) scale validation grant, specifically for Mexican-origin young adults (ages 21-40 years old). Our proposed research will focus on collecting and analyzing egocentric social network data, using the results to validate the new social support scale, and identifying differences in the way social structures impact the target oral health behaviors of interest (oral hygiene, accessing dental care). This proposed study is complementary to the parent grant’s scale validation goals, bridges theories and methodological approaches, and adds a new level of validation to the new OHBSS scale. The Structural Influence Model of Health Communication will be used as a guiding framework. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a compelling addition that naturally extends the social support focus. Our work will generate key input examining the social network structures that facilitate the transmission of effective social support in promoting oral health behaviors, and lead to future studies addressing oral health disparities among Mexican-origin individuals by providing insight into whom members of this population perceive receiving effective social support for oral health behaviors. Identifying these critical individuals within one’s social network may enhance the design and deployment of future oral health interventions that ultimately reduce oral health disparities, a goal that aligns with the mission of the National Institutes of Health. This one-year project will address three integrated research aims. Aim 1 will focus on collecting and analyzing egocentric network data using a sex-stratified and balanced subsample of 60 study participants (50% men, 50% Spanish language dominant, 50% single marital status) from both parent study sites (1 urban, 1 rural area in two counties in California along the US-Mexico border). These participants will complete a half-hour individual interview, in either English or Spanish, to collect network density data through a standard name-generation social network mapping approach. Aim 2 proposes to validate the OHBSS self- report scale responses through the identification of specific individuals in the participants’ social networks. Specifically, convergent and discriminant validity with OHBSS scale responses will be examined. Aim 3 focuses on comparing modes of communication and influence on Mexican-origin young adult men and women’s oral health behaviors by family members, health providers, or others in the participants’ social networks. Analyses will specifically focus on determining whether effects of network structure on oral health behaviors are differentially stratified by socio-demographic characteristics. Findings from the SNA data can then inform the development of interventions to promote oral health behaviors among Mexican-origin young adult men and women designed to reduce the unequal burden of oral health disparities. Project Narrative The goal of this Administrative Supplement for Collaborative Science will support a new research partnership (between investigators in the Schools of Public Health and Communication), and the addition of social network science applied to an existing bilingual (English/Spanish) social support scale validation grant, specifically for Mexican-origin young adults to engage in oral health-promoting behaviors.

They face barriers to accessing oral health services (e.g., among the lowest rates of dental insurance among any racial or ethnic group), and are disproportionately less likely to seek regular and preventive dental care. Latino children and adults also experience higher rates of dental caries, gingivitis, and/or chronic periodontitis. Studies of oral health among Latinos have been limited to identifying individual-level socioeconomic and sociocultural mechanisms, with little attention to broader personal and community network contexts. Viewed from a network science perspective, the health behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes of individuals are shaped through contact and communication with others; there is a strong relationship between social networks and health outcomes. The current oral health research toolbox does not adequately capture the multiple nested levels of influence embodied in OHD. We propose to apply Social Network Analysis (SNA) methods to address the critical need to understand how social norms, attitudes, resources, and information around dental care and oral health propagate through personal and community networks, and affect individual behavior and outcomes. In the proposed research we will build on our completed formative project (NIDCR DE022096), a pioneer study using SNA methods in OHD research targeting people of Mexican descent (or Mexican-Americans [MAs]) in the US. In that prior cross-sectional design we characterized experiences about food, oral health behaviors, and dental care in the context of the networks they live in. Describing OHD factors and mechanisms affecting MAs has great public health significance because the MA sub-group makes up about 60% of Latinos in the US. In the present longitudinal design, we will develop a strong causal model of OHD by focusing on the dynamic processes underlying the coevolution of networks, oral health culture, and dental care attitudes and behaviors over time among MAs who have recently immigrated. Our specific aims are to: 1) characterize the norms, attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions of barriers around dental care and oral health among MA immigrants, with specific attention to associations between these factors and personal social network features; and 2) determine the relationships between acculturation, personal and community network dynamics, diffusion of norms and resources, and evolving oral health behaviors, attitudes, and outcomes over time among MA immigrants. Having additional, and more accurate knowledge about the complex and dynamic mechanisms underlying OHD will provide a foundation to develop four aspects: effective public policy, efficient clinical guidelines, culturally-sensitive clinical and preventive care, and futur research directions with practical applications. Moreover, drawing on the rich body of existing research on network interventions and diffusion of innovation from other health areas, our findings can be applied to tailoring programs that leverage the strengths and resources of MA communities to improve population oral health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Latino population - the largest and fastest growing ethnic group in the US - has significant barriers to dental services and is afflicted by large oral health disparities. Attempts to address such problems through individual behavior change have been largely unsuccessful because little is known about the complex network dimensions in which patterns of oral health self-care and dental services utilization take place. The proposed research will study one Latino community to trace relationships over time between acculturation, personal and community network dynamics, diffusion of norms and resources, and experiences of oral health, to yield a solid base for effective public policy and culturally-sensitive clinicalcare.",Social Network Dynamics and Oral Health Disparities in Mexican American Immigrants,9911986,R01DE025836,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Attitude to Health ', ' health attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Biology ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' dental service ', ' Dental caries ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Decay ', ' tooth decay ', ' Diffusion ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Evolution ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gingivitis ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services ', ' Immigration ', ' Dental Insurance ', ' Dental Surgery Insurance ', ' Oral Surgery Insurance ', ' Orthodontia insurance ', ' Orthodontic insurance ', ' Periodontic insurance ', ' dental health insurance ', ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanas ', ' Chicanos ', ' Oral Characters ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Perception ', ' Periodontitis ', ' Chronic Periodontitis ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Assimilations ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Social Network ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Mexican ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Community Networks ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' social ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NIDCR ', ' NIDR ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Subgroup ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' application in practice ', ' practical application ', ' service utilization ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' longitudinal design ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' causal diagram ', ' causal model ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative dental care ', ' Preventative dental service ', ' Preventive dental service ', ' Preventive dental care ', ' sociometrics ', ' social metrics ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' ']",NIDCR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2020,1151861,0.292608069445997
"Longitudinal Analysis of Low pH Streptococci and Plaque Microbiome in Early Childhood Caries ABSTRACT  The microbial etiology of dental caries remains a subject of debate with considerable differences of opinion regarding the relative contributions of specific species or classes of bacteria. The `low pH streptococci' is a designation given to atypical, highly acidogenic strains of oral streptococci originally thought to belong to the primary plaque colonizing species S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii, and S. anginosus. This sub-group of streptococci is proposed to have considerable cariogenic potential, perhaps preceding, augmenting or even overshadowing the contribution of the mutans streptococci (MS). However, assessing the role of the low pH strep is not straightforward. Accurate assignment of species among the viridans streptococci is a challenge, and the low pH phenotype cannot be ascertained by the gene-based strategies routinely employed in non-culture based studies of the oral microbiome. In this application we propose a unique prospective study that combines state-of-the-art bioinformatics with phenotypic analyses of low pH phenotypes to track changes in the plaque microbiome, with a specific focus on the MS and non-MS low pH streptococci, as caries develop in children at high risk for early childhood caries. Specifically, our objectives are to determine if there is ascendancy of non- MS low pH streptococci within the plaque oral microbiome with potential shifts in composition of other organisms during the transition from a sound enamel site to a carious enamel site. In addition, we propose a novel and exciting approach of categorizing low pH streptococci based on their potential to produce alkaline products. We believe that gaining a more comprehensive assessment of the low pH streptococcal species or taxa, and our novel grouping of these organisms based on alkaline-producing phenotypes, as part of our determination of the plaque microbiome composition has the potential to make significant contributions to implementation science. To meet our objectives we propose the following aims: 1) Conduct an 18-month longitudinal study on high-caries risk children aged 1-3 to determine changes in the overall plaque microbiome preceding caries development, with a focus on the non-MS low pH streptococci; and 2) Use genomic sequencing to assign species identity or taxonomical relatedness to the non-MS low pH streptococci recovered in Aim 1. By coalescing and analyzing the data from the microbiome and low pH streptococci as caries develop we will define patterns or drivers of caries or health that may provide a basis for advances in implementation science. NARRATIVE  A major influence on the development of dental decay is the composition of bacteria that comprise dental plaque. In the proposed study, we will examine the recoveries and proportions of a prominent group of plaque bacteria, the streptococci, from dental plaque samples collected from ages one to three in a population of children at a high risk for early childhood dental decay. We will compare the changes in streptococcal populations with the overall plaque microbiome composition to gain a better appreciation for the microbial contribution to dental decay so that more efficient means of risk assessment, treatment and prevention can be formulated.",Longitudinal Analysis of Low pH Streptococci and Plaque Microbiome in Early Childhood Caries,9933887,R01DE026716,"['Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Odontogenesis ', ' dental development ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Pathology ', ' Pediatric Dentistry ', ' Pedodontics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Scoring Method ', ' sound ', ' Streptococcus ', ' Streptococcus mutans ', ' S mutans ', ' S. mutans ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' exhaust ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Lesion ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Mouth ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Host Factor ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' S mitior ', ' S mitis ', ' S. mitior ', ' S. mitis ', ' Streptococcus mitior ', ' Streptococcus mitis ', ' S anginosus ', ' S. anginosus ', ' Streptococcus anginosus ', ' Viridans Streptococci ', ' viridans group streptococci ', ' Streptococcus Viridans Group ', ' S oralis ', ' S. oralis ', ' Streptococcus oralis ', ' S gordonii ', ' S. gordonii ', ' Streptococcus gordonii ', ' Research Priority ', ' Pattern ', ' pediatric department ', ' basicity ', ' alkalinity ', ' early childhood ', ' microbial ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' microbiome ', ' oral microbiome ', ' oral streptococci ', ' oral plaque ', ' Minority ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' microbiome community composition ', ' microbiome species composition ', ' microbiome composition ', ' Acid-Base Equilibrium ', ' Acid-Base Balance ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Bacteria ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Dental caries ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Decay ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Enamel ', ' Enamel ', ' tooth enamel ', ' Dental Plaque ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Iowa ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2020,524277,0.19728688772915784
"Birth to Three – Cavity Free: Effectiveness of a Psychoeducational Intervention for ECC Prevention PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Project Title: “Birth to Three – Cavity Free: Effectiveness of a Psychoeducational Intervention for ECC Prevention”  Early childhood caries (ECC) is a potentially painful and debilitating disease, which represents a significant public health problem among young children. There are profound disparities in ECC experiences such that children from minority and low-income families suffer a disproportionate share of the disease burden. The likelihood of parents of high-ECC risk young children seeking prevention in dental facilities is low; therefore, there is a need to increase preventive dental opportunities where these children already seek health care services. In particular, there is an urgent need to develop and evaluate ECC behavioral interventions for use in public health settings attended by high-risk children. Many authors recommend early implementation of oral health education as one means of preventing ECC. However, major issues discussed in the oral health promotion literature involve a lack of effectiveness among programs based on education alone, as well as a lack of high quality preventive interventions using evidence-based psychological and behavioral strategies.  Our research team has been the first to introduce to the ECC prevention arena the self-determination theory (SDT) of motivation, internalization, and healthy functioning, proven effective in promoting positive behavioral changes in several other fields, including oral health care. We have demonstrated that SDT has great promise as a motivational approach by providing evidence, based on results from our R21 (R21-DE016483) study, of the effectiveness of SDT in changing several desirable oral health behaviors for ECC prevention. Building upon the rigor of our previous experience and formative research work in the past several years, we propose a Stage II NIH Model research project that will compare the efficacy of autonomy-supportive videotaped oral health messages framed by SDT to more traditional neutral videotaped messages. We intent to recruit 634 pregnant mothers enrolled in Iowa Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Supplemental Nutrition Programs and follow them until their future child is 36 months old. The primary outcome of interest will be children's caries status. Secondary outcomes will be changes in children's oral health behaviors conducive to better oral hygiene and dietary habits, as well as lower levels of dental plaque and mutans streptococci. PROJECT NARRATIVE Untreated cases of early childhood caries (ECC) may expose a child to pain, potentially life- threating infection, failure to thrive, learning difficulties, among several other problems. Building upon the rigor of our prior research, we propose a Stage II research according to the NIH Stage Model that will compare the efficacy of videotaped autonomy-supportive oral health messages framed by the self-determination theory (SDT) to more traditional neutral videotaped messages among mother-child dyads enrolled in Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) programs located in a rural population with large Hispanic and African American minorities. It is hoped that, in the future, our autonomy-supportive messages can (1) be used in numerous settings (i.e. public health clinics, hospitals, medical/dental offices); (2) be disseminated through the social media (i.e. Facebook) and website (i.e. YouTube); (3) increase access to early dental prevention at low-cost targeted especially for high-caries risk minority groups; (4) break the walls of language barrier by narrating the messages in all desirable languages; and (5) be used later on by other researchers and clinicians as an additional tool to their strategies to prevent ECC.",Birth to Three – Cavity Free: Effectiveness of a Psychoeducational Intervention for ECC Prevention,9941374,UG3DE029443,"['website ', ' web site ', ' cost ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Caries prevention ', ' Population ', ' psychoeducational intervention ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' operation ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' social media ', ' minority children ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' lower income families ', ' recruit ', ' experimental group ', ' Facebook ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' Rural Minority ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Control Groups ', ' Dental caries ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Decay ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Facilities ', ' dental health care facility ', ' dental healthcare facility ', ' Dental Offices ', ' Dental Plaque ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Failure to Thrive ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Habits ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Infection ', ' Iowa ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mothers ', ' Motivation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nutrition ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parents ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Psychological Theory ', ' Psychologic Theory ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Rural Population ', ' Self Determination ', ' Streptococcus mutans ', ' S mutans ', ' S. mutans ', ' Testing ', ' Videotape ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Competence ', ' Dietary Habits ', ' eating habit ', ' Diet Habits ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Dental ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Salivary ', ' Clinic ', ' Food Supplements ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' Structure ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Age-Months ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,UG3,2020,309000,0.2693060894219556
"COVID-19: The Effectiveness of Silver Diamine Fluoride- Role in Reducing Health Disparities in Young Children(AdminSuppl) Summary The proposed Administrative Supplement is an addition to a Cooperative Agreement for support of a Phase III randomized clinical trial (RCT) to assess the effectiveness of 38% silver diamine fluoride (SDF). SDF became available in the U.S. in 2014, and is being used “off label” for management of cavitated lesions in primary teeth. Early childhood caries (ECC) continues to be one of the most prevalent chronic conditions among U.S. children. It also is one of the most common unmet healthcare needs of poor children (e.g., Head Start children). If allowed to progress untreated for long periods of time, the disease can have broad dental, medical, social, and quality of life consequences. ECC and severe-ECC (e.g., multiple cavitated lesions or at least one caries lesion in the anterior teeth, with onset at an early age) is relatively inexpensive to prevent, yet becomes extremely burdensome on the children and families, and expensive to treat once lesions cavitate. This is especially true in young children who need extensive treatment, or are uncooperative, etc., where treatment under general anesthesia, in most cases in hospital operating rooms, is the standard of care. In 2016, the FDA issued a notice to health care providers that general anesthesia in young children can result in permanent neurological damage and should be avoided. Thus, better strategies are needed to successfully manage cavitated caries lesions in young children. This RCT will be accomplished by targeting young children who have cavitated caries lesions that have exposed dentin clinically. Because of the Breakthrough Therapy Status for SDF, FDA has been heavily involved in the design of this trial to ensure it will meet the requirements for a cavitated caries lesion “arrest” drug claim, which is innovative in the U.S. The proposed protocol in this application has been submitted by Advantage Silver Dental Arrest, LLC, holder of IND 124808, to the FDA as part of our collaboration. Following a study preparation period, an experienced research team is conducting a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled superiority trial, with two parallel groups involving a total of 1,144 children, 1-5 years old, who will be followed over a period of 8 months, to assess the impact of 38% SDF on: Aim 1 (Primary study aim)- arrest of cavitated lesions after one application, assessed at 6 months follow-up; Aim 2- arrest of cavitated lesions after being applied twice, 6 months apart, and compare the effect of one application at 3 and 6 months (Sub-Aim 2a); Aim 3- pain after being applied twice, 6 months apart, and after a single application (assessed at 3 and 6 months; Sub-Aim 3a); and Aim 4- Family-level outcomes, including oral health-related quality of life (Sub-Aim 4a), and treatment satisfaction and acceptability (Sub-Aim 4b). The immediate impact and significance of this innovative project is that provision of and access to a non-invasive, inexpensive, and simple to use alternative to manage cavitated caries lesions for children with limited access to care could profoundly improve oral health by arresting lesions, reducing pain, improving quality of life, and significantly reducing costs, all contributing to substantial reductions in disparities in caries. This supplement request is meant to address some of the impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on recruitment, follow-up and retention of study participants, and additional costs associated with being able to resume clinical activities and replace 132 children that will be out of the study window. Project Narrative: The University of Michigan, in collaboration with researchers at New York University, the University of Iowa, and Indiana University, are implementing a Phase III multicenter, randomized clinical trial (RCT), to test the effectiveness of 38% Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF) in stopping the progression of cavities (i.e., large holes which result from dental caries, a common and debilitating disease) in the teeth of young children. Should the trial be successful, the impact would be a change in the standard of care and expanded access to a simple, non-invasive, inexpensive strategy to manage cavitated caries lesions in young children in the U.S., which otherwise are usually treated with potentially damaging general anesthesia and fillings or extractions. Access to this simple, non-aerosol treatment should result in a reduction of disparities in access to care, and improvements in oral health, which addresses the NIDCR Strategic Plan Goal 3 [to apply rigorous, multidisciplinary research approaches to overcome disparities in dental, oral, and craniofacial health].",COVID-19: The Effectiveness of Silver Diamine Fluoride- Role in Reducing Health

"Interactive Parent-targeted Text Messaging in Pediatric Clinics to Reduce ECC The iSmile study is part of the NIDCR’s Multidisciplinary and Collaborative Research Consortium to Reduce Oral Health Disparities in Children. The prevalence of Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is increasing, disproportionately affecting racial and ethnic minorities. Prevention efforts for high risk groups require multi- level strategies. We will target parents/legal guardians of children (<7 years) during pediatric well-child visits at urban community health centers (CHCs) and a hospital-based pediatric clinic, and provide a text-message based ECC prevention intervention. Eighty five percent of adults use text messaging, with no disparities by race/ethnicity, education or income. The benefits of text message interventions include the use anywhere/anytime, low cost, scalability to large populations, ability to tailor message content and intensity, and provision of strategies in real time. CHCs are an ideal venue for oral health promotion both at an individual level (they provide care to the groups at highest risk for ECC) and at a population level (there are 90 CHCs electronically linked locally and >1,100 CHCs nationally). In UH2, we developed a theory-based text message program that is automated, interactive and gamified, and involves behavioral shaping towards better oral health. The content of the texts are consistent with AAP guidelines, and Social Cognitive Theory. We used the Fisher-Owens Model (2007) as an intervention planning framework. In the current UH3 phase, 754 parents/legal guardians of children <7 years attending our target CHCs were randomized to receive one of two dose-equivalent text message interventions: Oral Health Texts (OHT) or Child Wellness Texts (CWT). All participants have completed the intervention and collection of outcome data is ongoing. The primary outcome variable is ECC incidence at 24 months. We will assess mediators and moderators of the intervention effect, perform a budget impact analysis to determine the financial consequences of adoption, diffusion, and sustainability of the OHT intervention at CHCs, and assess changes in both pediatric and parent oral health behaviors. This research has strong potential to be an evidence based program that could easily be adopted at low cost and low provider burden in the 1,128 CHCs in the U.S. that treat almost 4.5 million high risk children <7 years old. Our text message intervention is innovative because involves system-generated real time support, tailoring, feedback, and interactivity. Our study has theoretical significance because it integrates a testable theory with an intervention planning model to elucidate mechanisms of change at multiple levels. Due to delays in start-up and the unanticipated costs due to COVID-19, this administrative supplement request for funding is necessary to complete the aims of the originally funded research. Project Narrative Despite the fact that early childhood caries (ECC) is preventable, it is the most common chronic childhood disease in the US, affecting 28% of those aged 2-5, and disproportionately affecting poor and minority groups. We propose an interactive text messaging intervention delivered to parents of children younger than 7 years old, which aims to foster healthy parent behaviors and reduce ECC in their children. This novel, low cost approach has the potential to expand the ability of community health center (CHC) pediatric clinics to efficiently integrate oral health promotion into their practice and could easily be disseminated to the 1200 CHCs in the United States that treat 4.5 million children younger than 7, most of whom are at high risk for ECC.",Interactive Parent-targeted Text Messaging in Pediatric Clinics to Reduce ECC,10220440,UH3DE025492,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Dental caries ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Decay ', ' tooth decay ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Feedback ', ' Fluorides ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Interview ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Leadership ', ' Legal Guardians ', ' Lip structure ', ' Lip ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Ownership ', ' Parents ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Testing ', ' Textiles ', ' fabric ', ' Time ', ' Toothbrushing ', ' tooth brushing ', ' Toothpaste ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Lifting ', ' Link ', ' Dental ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Shapes ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' NIDCR ', ' NIDR ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Collection ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Caries prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' 7 years of age ', ' age 7 years ', ' seven year old ', ' seven years of age ', ' 7 year old ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Evidence based program ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tailored messaging ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' followup assessment ', ' follow up assessment ', ' arm ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' racial minority ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' income disparities ', ' urban setting ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' Child Health ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' clinical exam ', ' clinical examination ', ' budget impact ', ' ']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,UH3,2020,259001,0.2035991259875632
"Impact of Dental Care Access on Children's Oral Health and Academic Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Poor oral health in childhood is correlated with more school absences and lower academic achievement. There is evidence to suggest that state-level Medicaid policies, including payment rates to dentists, adult dental coverage, and coverage of fluoride varnish (FV) application by non-dentist primary care providers, have meaningful effects on the likelihood that low-income children receive recommended dental services. However, little research has linked specific Medicaid policies that increase dental care access to measures of child oral health, and further, no rigorous, large-scale studies with plausibly causal research designs have examined the connection between these policies and academic performance. There is a critical need for rigorous evidence on the potential for state-level policies to achieve improvements in these outcomes. This proposal will provide novel evidence on the link between dental care access and measures of oral health and academic performance using a natural experiment design that leverages state-level variation in Medicaid payment rates to dentists, adult dental coverage, and FV policies during 1999-2016 and large-scale national datasets that include exam-based and administrative outcome measures. Our study period captures a substantial number of state-level changes while also representing a relatively recent time frame. Our analysis will also assess important subgroup differences by child sex, age group, and race and ethnicity. In Aim 1, we will examine the link between each policy and oral health measures including the parent-reported condition of teeth from the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH), exam-based objective measures of untreated caries and the presence of dental sealants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and administrative records of emergency department visits for oral conditions from the State Emergency Department Databases (SEDD). In Aim 2, we will assess the connection between each policy and academic outcomes including school absences, school contacts with parents, parental concern about learning pre-school skills, and grade retention from the NSCH, Peabody Individual Achievement Test scores and grade retention from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth – Child and Young Adult Cohort (CNLSY), and school absences from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study – Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K). This will be the first national study to estimate the plausibly causal link between increased access to dental care and academic performance among low-income children. This research will provide critical, timely, and policy-relevant new evidence on the effects of increased access to dental care and the role for public health insurance policy. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will use a natural experiment design to identify the effects of Medicaid policies with the potential to promote dental care access on measures of oral health and academic performance among children during 1999-2016.

"Great Beginnings for Healthy Native Smiles PROJECT SUMMARY Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is the most common chronic disease among children. American Indian (AI) children are 4 times more likely to have untreated dental decay than white children. If left untreated, ECC can lead to chronic pain, loss of teeth, poor nutrition, and impaired growth. The proposed study aims to reduce the burden of ECC in two AI communities through an innovative, community based participatory approach. The project will: 1) partner with 2 tribes, the Hopi Tribe (Arizona) and the Crow Tribe (Montana), to conduct a formative assessment on oral health (OH); 2) adapt a “bundled” best practices OH intervention to be locally and contextually relevant for each of our tribal communities; and 3) conduct a randomized, controlled study to evaluate the impact of the “bundled” best practices OH intervention (compared to a standard prenatal/postnatal healthy lifestyle intervention) on the reduction of ECC. Community health representatives (CHRs) will be trained to deliver the interventions with pregnant women and follow them until the child’s last exam (24-36 months). The OH intervention will consist of 4 intervention components known to be effective (best practices) in the prevention of ECC: 1) dietary and OH education provided during pregnancy and the postnatal period; 2) OH care of children including the application of fluoride varnish; 3) motivational interviewing with children’s mothers; and 4) patient navigation of existing OH and other social services in each study community, facilitated by CHRs. Caries experience (dmfs) and severity will be compared across both conditions at the 1, 2, and 3- year exams. Mother knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to ECC will be also measured for both conditions at pre-test and post-test. Surveys will assess each level of the social ecological model. Individual level domains will include: 1) demographics of mother and baby (pre-test only); 2) dental health of the child to date; 3) mother’s and child’s OH (postnatal); 4) mother’s knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes about best practices in OH; 5) mother’s perception of self-efficacy and susceptibility; and 6) mother’s prenatal health and experiences. Interpersonal level domains will include: 1) current living situation and family support; 2) availability of emotional, informational, and instrumental support; and 3) perceptions of peers’ and family members’ attitudes toward caregiving and OH. Community level domains will include: 1) tribal identity and related experiences; 2) care coordination, transportation, and access to social and OH services; and 3) perceptions of cultural congruence of CHR interactions and intervention materials. If successful, this community-based approach may prove to be a feasible method for improving OH of AI children and reducing the burden of ECC in many Native communities with limited access to regular dental care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is the most common chronic disease affecting young children. American Indian children are particularly burdened by untreated dental caries and decay, which can lead to chronic pain, loss of teeth, poor nutrition, impaired growth, and may become aggressive if left untreated.

"Longitudinal Analysis of Dental Caries Indices in Inner-City African-American Children Project Summary This project addresses the urgent need of a comprehensive model to further our understanding of the complex and dynamic role of various risk factors in early childhood caries (ECC) development across the child's age continuum. Although the risk factors (biological, behavioral, socio-economic, psychological and environmental) of ECC are relatively well known, their effects and their discriminating power along the disease pathological process remain poorly understood. A popular approach for evaluating these effects has been to use models that impose homogeneity along the life course of the disease, or to rely on cross-sectional data. This approach is useful but has limitations. Some risk factors may be more important in very early life (eg., low birth weight and other biological conditions), but less relevant in older ages as other risk factors come into play and the children become more vulnerable to caries. A unique study that provides detailed longitudinal information to untangle the cascade of relevant risk factors along the life course of ECC is the Detroit Dental Health Project. This is a longitudinal study designed to understand the oral health of low-income African-American children (0-5 years) and their main caregivers (14+ years) residing in the city of Detroit, Michigan. Among other information, this study comprises longitudinal investigations involving various risk factors and mouth-level caries indices which can help to delineate the natural trajectories of ECC in an unfortunate setting of limited clinical intervention. Analyzing ECC data from the Detroit study is inherently complex because of the large number of ECC risk factors that are potentially correlated; complex relationships between these risk factors and caries along the child's age continuum; the longitudinal (within-child) association of caries indices; and a sizeable frequency of zero-valued caries indices. To our best knowledge, we are not aware of any statistical method that addresses these nontrivial complications that are very specific to ECC indices and the Detroit data. We propose to fill this gap in the literature by formulating a less restrictive semiparametric model coupled with a variable selection method to understand the life course of ECC among inner-city African-American children. Formulating and implementing such a model is not trivial owing to the complexity of the theoretical arguments and the computational burden. Following the completion of this project, we will acquire evidenced-based knowledge that would be helpful in tailoring a dental caries prevention policy for low-income children during the first five years of life. Project Narrative The proposed research will formulate a less restrictive semiparametric model to further our understanding of the life course of early childhood dental caries in relation to important risk factors. The success of the project will advance our knowledge of early childhood caries in low-income African-American children, and help policy makers formulate prevention recommendations targeted for specific subgroups of this population, which ultimately will eliminate intra-group oral health disparities.",Longitudinal Analysis of Dental Caries Indices in Inner-City African-American Children,9856434,R03DE027108,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Dental caries ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Decay ', ' tooth decay ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DMF Index ', ' DMF Indexe ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birth weight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birthweight ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Tooth ', ' teeth ', ' Toothbrushing ', ' tooth brushing ', ' Primary Dentition ', ' Deciduous Dentition ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Mouth ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' tooth surface ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' early childhood ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Caries prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' evidence base ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' screening ', ' Formulation ', ' semiparametric ', ' ']",NIDCR,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,149204,0.18603515469927953
"Obesity and Caries in Young South Asian Children: A Common Risk Factor Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): South Asians are the fastest growing immigrant community in the United States and experience high rates of health disparities. South Asian children are at high risk for the two most common diseases of early childhood: caries and obesity. This application uses the Common Risk/Health Factor Approach (CR/HFA) to target risk factors for childhood caries and obesity. Our study, CHALO! (""Child Health Action to Lower Oral Health and Obesity Risk"") comes from the Hindi word that means ""Let's go!"". CHALO is a multi-level intervention (see figure) that includes a randomized controlled trial of a home visit intervention, and a Knowledge Translation campaign. The primary focus is behavioral change in bottle/'sippy' cup use and dietary intake-- factors that are common to both caries and obesity. Unique cariogenic and obesogenic behaviors are also targeted. Secondary outcomes include caries incidence and growth. Research assessments when children are 6 (baseline), 12, and 18 months of age will include novel techniques for assessing feeding practices (i.e., iPad assisted 24 hour dietary recall) and caries presence and severity (i.e., intra-oral cameras) that were developed by our team. CHALO will be conducted in the metro NY/NJ area, home to a large low-income high risk South Asian community. An RCT (Aim 1) will enroll 377 mothers of children 4-6 months old from New York City (n=3) and New Jersey (n=2) pediatric practices in our primary care research network SAPPHIRE (""SA Practice Partnership for Health Improvement and Research""). The intervention includes: a) home visits with mothers/families (n=6 visits over one year) and follow up phone support; b) patient navigation to make/keep timely dental visits (2x by 18 months). The Knowledge Translation component (Aim 2) will raise awareness of child health risks in South Asian communities and among professionals who provide their care. The campaign will include both traditional and social media components and will be evaluated using multiple metrics. Our multi-disciplinary team has expertise in cross-cultural psychology, clinical trials, child nutrition, health education and caries. CHALO builds upon the team's prior and on-going funded trials of caries and obesity interventions in young children. Innovations include: use of CR/HFA to target twin child health disparities; under-studied South Asian immigrant sample; intervention at multiple levels of the Social-Ecological model; cutting edge measurement technologies; and social marketing and evaluation. If successful, the CR/HFA offers an efficient and potentially cost-effective means of improving child health in at-risk populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study employs a Common Risk/Health Factors Approach (CR/HFA) to the 2 most common health disparities of early childhood -dental caries and obesity-- in the nation's fast growing low-income South Asian immigrant community. It includes: a) an RCT- aimed at reducing feeding practices that increase caries and obesity risks (e.g., use of bottle/'sippy' cups) and increasing health-promoting behaviors (activity, dental visit) in young children, and b) a Knowledge Translation campaign to raise awareness among families, communities, and dental and pediatric providers. This study represents the first application of the CR/HFA in the nation, and only the second RCT of this efficient and potentially cost-effective approach worldwide.",Obesity and Caries in Young South Asian Children: A Common Risk Factor Approach,9868822,R01MD010460,"['Anxiety ', ' Awareness ', ' Bangladesh ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Nutrition ', ' pediatric nutrition ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Control Groups ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' dental service ', ' Dental caries ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Decay ', ' tooth decay ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Family ', ' Feeding Patterns ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Incidence ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Methods ', ' Milk ', ' Modernization ', ' Mothers ', ' New Jersey ', ' New York City ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Pakistan ', ' Partnership Practice ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Marketing ', ' Sweetening Agents ', ' Sweeteners ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Toothbrushing ', ' tooth brushing ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Dental ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Napping ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Juice ', ' Dietary intake ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Length ', ' Age-Months ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' South Asian ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' child adiposity ', ' child obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obese children ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' House Call ', ' home visit ', ' Home visitation ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' tv watching ', ' feeding ', ' cost effective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' obesity risk ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' knowledge translation ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' secondary outcome ', ' obesigenic ', ' obesogenic ', ' social media ', ' Child Health ', ' ']",NIMHD,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,768134,0.11087885270837702
"Evaluation of Geographic Variation in Pediatric Preventive Dental Services PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over half of low income children in the U.S. have experienced tooth decay, one-third of whom have untreated decay. Tooth decay in children is largely preventable with routine dental care that includes professionally applied topical fluoride and dental sealants. However, low income children who are at the greatest risk of developing tooth decay are the least likely to receive these services – even if they do see a dentist for routine care. A large body of previous research has examined barriers to dental care and factors associated with preventive dental utilization from the patient perspective; limited research has focused on how dentist treatment patterns contribute to disparities. In this study, we will evaluate how regional patterns in clinical dental practice affect dentists' rates of providing preventive dental services to children who are at elevated risk for tooth decay. The outcome of interest is the proportion of children treated by each dentist who received preventive dental services, including rates of topical fluoride and dental sealant placement. Dentists' service patterns will be explored in the context of dental service areas – regional markets identified based on where patients travel to receive care. Variation in rates of preventive dental services will be examined at the individual dentist level, and variation within and among service areas will be estimated. The project aims are to: (1) assess provider-level variation in the provision of preventive dental services, (2) evaluate clinical practice variation within and across geographical regions, and (3) identify factors associated with increased preventive dental service rates. Our long-term goal is to explore the mechanisms by which local clinical treatment patterns develop in order to identify modifiable factors that can be leveraged by educational interventions to increase use of science-based information by dentists. The long- term impact of these interventions would be to increase use of preventive dental services and reduce oral health disparities in high risk populations. This proposed project addresses NIDCR's 2014-2019 Strategic Plan goal to overcome disparities in dental, oral, and craniofacial health. It also addresses Healthy People 2020 Oral Health Objectives 8, 12, and 14, which aim to increase the proportion of children and adolescents who receive preventive dental services. Dentists' propensity to provide evidence-based preventive dental services is potentially modifiable; findings from this study will support design of tailored educational interventions and policy. Targeting behavior change at the provider level could offer a cost-effective method to reduce oral health disparities in children by shifting treatment patterns towards prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will explore regional variation in the preventive dental services provided to children at elevated risk for tooth decay. Despite previous research demonstrating the effectiveness of topical fluoride and pit-and- fissure sealants in preventing tooth decay, relatively few children who see a dentist for routine care receive these services. Findings from this research will provide the initial knowledge needed to design interventions targeting dental providers that aim to increase provision of evidence-based preventive services to high-risk children.",Evaluation of Geographic Variation in Pediatric Preventive Dental Services,9964768,R03DE028963,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Health Service Area ', ' Health Catchment Area ', ' Service area ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Clinical Practice Variations ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' dental service ', ' Dental caries ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Decay ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dentists ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Topical Fluorides ', ' Foundations ', ' Dental General Practice ', ' dental practice ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Iowa ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Methods ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Patients ', ' Pit and Fissure Sealants ', ' Dental Sealants ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Dental Schools ', ' Science ', ' Standardization ', ' Travel ', ' Unemployment ', ' jobless ', ' joblessness ', ' out of work ', ' unemployed ', ' United States Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' HRSA ', ' Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Evaluation ', ' Dental ', ' Failure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Knowledge ', ' Oral ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' experience ', ' Topical Drug Administration ', ' administer topically ', ' apply topically ', ' deliver topically ', ' topical administration ', ' topical delivery ', ' topical drug application ', ' topical treatment ', ' topically administered ', ' topically applied ', ' topically delivered ', ' topically treated ', ' treat topically ', ' Topical application ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' NIDCR ', ' NIDR ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' aged ', ' federal poverty level ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' routine care ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' child patients ', ' pediatric patients ', ' Preventative dental care ', ' Preventative dental service ', ' Preventive dental service ', ' Preventive dental care ', ' Preventative service ', ' Preventive service ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' welfare ', ' Service provision ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R03,2020,154500,0.17079006030401167
"Complex Systems Science Approaches to Addressing Oral Health Disparities Oral health disparities, particularly among children, continue to be a pressing problem in the US. While the oral health of children has improved overall, those from disadvantaged population groups continue to suffer from a greater than average disease burden. Oral health disparities reflect a complex set of pathways and mechanisms with bidirectional associations (feedback loops) that traverse the macro- and micro-levels of disease causation. The overall goal of this proposal is to facilitate the candidate’s long term career goal of becoming an independent social epidemiologist capable of investigating disease causation and prevention through a complex systems-based perspective. The current proposal aims to provide the candidate with the opportunity to develop the necessary skills and experience to achieve research independence by extending their formal training in epidemiology and applied experiences in oral health disparities research. Development activities proposed during the mentored phase are related to training the candidate in Complex Systems Science (CSS) approaches, namely social network analysis (SNA) and agent-based modeling (ABM). Training will occur through coursework, multidisciplinary mentoring and applied research experiences. The primary vehicle for development is the research plan. The proposed research aims to use CSS approaches to better understand the factors and mechanisms underlying oral health among a disadvantaged population, and to improve the strategies aimed at improving oral health, thereby reducing observed disparities. These approaches facilitate an understanding of the population, social interaction and environmental influence simultaneously and can explore interactions, feedback loops and reciprocity between independent and dependent variables. The first phase of the proposed work aims to develop a detailed conceptual model of oral health disparities that captures the multi-level mechanisms and will be used to inform the development of an agent-based model. ABM refers to the use of stochastic computer simulations to understand how the distribution of health and disease on a population level emerge from explicitly programmed health behaviors, social interactions and movements of simulated individuals over simulated time. An ABM of oral health and social networks among residents of public housing will be developed and utilized to identify viable intervention targets. The second phase of the work proposes to conduct a longitudinal SNA of adult caregivers of young children residing in public housing. SNA is an empirical tool that has been utilized to better understand the social context within which individuals interact. The planned analysis will serve to provide longitudinal data that can be used to validate the estimates of intervention targets obtained from the agent-based model. Additionally, the feasibility and acceptability of a potential network-based intervention will be evaluated within the sample. Completion of the described aims will represent one of the first applications of complex systems science methods to oral health disparities and demarcate the independent research career of the candidate. The proposed research aims to address oral health disparities using complex systems science approaches. Oral health disparities reflect a complex set of pathways and mechanisms with bidirectional associations (feedback loops) that traverse the macro- and micro-levels of disease causation. Agent-based models and social network analysis will be used to better understand the factors and mechanisms underlying oral health disparities, and to improve the strategies aimed at reducing them.",Complex Systems Science Approaches to Addressing Oral Health Disparities,9983483,R00DE025917,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Boston ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Computers ', ' Data Collection ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' dental service ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Feedback ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Housing ', ' Investments ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Poverty ', ' Probability ', ' Public Housing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' sugar ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' member ', ' social movement ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' social ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Property ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Population Group ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Network-based ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' population health ', ' Social Processes ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' Child Health ', ' ']",NIDCR,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R00,2020,236099,0.2943674518402116
"Statewide implementation and evaluation of a rural, school-based, caries prevention program SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Our long term goal is to reduce oral health disparities in rural school children.  Our immediate goal is to test two new evidence-based, school-based, cavity prevention programs.  We will compare two preventions: (1) A newer, simpler, less expensive, efficient treatment using fluoride varnish + silver diamine fluoride; and (2) A more traditional, complex, expensive, time-intensive treatment that includes simple + sealants + interim therapeutic restorations. The simpler method takes 6 minutes to deliver, compared to the more complex method that takes 20 minutes. Therefore, if the simpler, less expensive is as effective as the more complex, more expensive method, the data could support clinical and policy change.  To compare the two methods we will use a cluster randomized control trial design. We will implement this program in rural New Hampshire schools. All children in a school with informed consent will receive the same treatment (either simple or complex). We will provide preventive care twice per year for the 5 year grant period.  We will follow all children longitudinally for five years to determine the effectiveness of each preventive method. The primary outcome to make this determination will be the percentage of children with untreated decay. This is one of the U.S. Healthy People oral health goals. We will also examine the cost and cost- effectiveness. This will allow us to determine the balance between effectiveness and cost.  Assessing effectiveness and costs is particularly important for reducing disparities. If an intervention is quick, inexpensive, and 100% effective, that is a relatively simple choice. Most interventions are not 100% effective. Therefore, information on time, expense, and effectiveness will allow us to make better informed clinical and policy decisions. Specifically, this will help us answer the question: How much of which preventive intervention will increase access, improve health, and reduce costs? Project Narrative  Dental cavities are world’s most prevalent disease. In the U.S., almost 4 in 10 rural schoolchildren have untreated cavities. To improve the health of children we will test two new school- based cavity prevention programs to see which works best.","Statewide implementation and evaluation of a rural, school-based, caries prevention program",9960573,R01MD011526,"['Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Sources ', ' Dental caries ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Decay ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Hygienists ', ' Dental Records ', ' Dentists ', ' Diamines ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Fluoride Varnishes ', ' Fluorides ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Planning ', ' plan health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Institutes ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' New Hampshire ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Schools ', ' Silver ', ' Ag element ', ' Dental Societies ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' economic analysis ', ' economic evaluation ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' restoration ', ' grade school ', ' elementary school ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' implementation research ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' prevention efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Caries prevention ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' health equity ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Prevention trial ', ' trial design ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative measure ', ' Preventive measure ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' rural counties ', ' Child Health ', ' health goals ', ' ']",NIMHD,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,714645,0.1427255370948846
"CenteringPregnancy Oral Health Promotion (CPOP) Clinical Trial Abstract Federal agencies and professional organizations have mounted a large effort to address an increasingly recognized public health problem – poor perinatal oral health – which has serious implications for maternal and child health and is largely preventable. Several national organizations have issued statements prioritizing the need to improve oral health and access to oral health care during pregnancy and the National Maternal and Child Health Bureau has released consensus statements and clinical guidelines on perinatal oral health care during pregnancy. The provision of the recommended oral health care during pregnancy has the potential to improve women's oral health through improved prevention and restorative care and to promote children's oral health through caregiver education and timely anticipatory guidance. Through funding from the NIDCR (R21DE019211 Adams, PI; U54 DE019285 Chung, PI), we developed and pilot tested the CenteringPregnancy Oral Health Promotion (“CPOP”) Intervention, an oral health intervention for pregnant women attending CenteringPregnancy® (CP), a group prenatal care program. The CPOP intervention consists of 2 educational and skills building modules (maternal and infant) that are integrated into the CP curriculum, and delivered by trained CP facilitators. To evaluate the modules, the women completed dental examinations and questionnaires assessments of OH knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors at pre- and post- intervention periods. Infant and maternal salivary bacterial levels were assessed when the infants were 6 and 12 months of age. Findings from the CPOP pilot studies show significant improvements in maternal and infant clinically-assessed oral health. NIDCR funding (R34DE024574) has supported the development of the final planning and preparation for the U01 CPOP RCT. The purpose of this U01 proposal is to test the efficacy of the CPOP intervention as a full scale Phase III randomized controlled trial among a group of women receiving CP prenatal care at sites across Northern California. If shown to be efficacious, CPOP could be implemented rapidly and broadly nationwide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although dental care during pregnancy including preventive and restorative care and anticipatory guidance regarding optimal infant oral health is important, most women do not receive dental care during pregnancy. However, most women do access prenatal care, and there are many aspects of dental care that can be delivered in non-dental settings such as prenatal care including oral health education, hygiene instruction and anticipatory guidance for infant oral health. If the CenteringPregnancy® Oral Health Promotion (CPOP) intervention was determined to be efficacious within a U01 clinical trial, it could be disseminated widely into CenteringPregnancy® (CP) group prenatal care programs nationwide, and potentially in other group care models, having a significant positive influence on oral health of women and children broadly.",CenteringPregnancy Oral Health Promotion (CPOP) Clinical Trial,9981724,U01DE027340,"['Attitude ', ' Attitude to Health ', ' health attitude ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Bacteria ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' dental service ', ' Dental caries ', ' Caries ', ' Dental Decay ', ' tooth decay ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hygiene ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Lactobacillus ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mothers ', ' Oral health ', ' dental health ', ' Dental Hygiene ', ' Oral Hygiene ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Prenatal care ', ' pregnancy care ', ' prenatal appointment ', ' prenatal checkup ', ' prenatal visit ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' professional association ', ' professional membership ', ' professional society ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Streptococcus mutans ', ' S mutans ', ' S. mutans ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Postpartum ', ' post-partum ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Peripartum ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' Fostering ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Letters ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Salivary ', ' health knowledge ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' skills ', ' empowerment ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Age-Months ', ' Caregiver instruction ', ' care giver education ', ' care giver instruction ', ' care giver training ', ' caregiver training ', ' caregiver education ', ' Maternal and Child Health ', ' NIDCR ', ' NIDR ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' ACOG ', ' American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ', ' Preparation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' post intervention ', ' Instruction ', ' oral streptococci ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' prenatal health ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' evidence base ', ' standard of care ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' efficacy testing ', ' applied learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' interactive learning ', ' hands-on learning ', ' community building ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' Child Health ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' ']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U01,2020,1473712,0.2803680329082957
